1). My project will use a variety of tools we have learned about and used in class in order to analyze rap lyrics. The goal of this analysis will be to investigate the claim that rap music has mostly negative language. In order to accomplish this, I will need to make a program that gathers a variety of rap lyrics online and then does some level of sentiment analysis to categorize words within the lyrics as positive (pro-social?) or negative. The ratio between positive and negative words will be use to discuss the claim that rap music contains a mostly negative lexicon.

2). I have ran into a few issues so far. The biggest hurdle that I've overcome was finding a website that had a large variety of easily-accessible rap lyrics and accessing them. Most webpages with lyrics are difficult to access with a python script. I managed to find one that works pretty well. The next challenge that I'm working on is that the program currently takes about a second to get the lyrics from one song. This is because the database that I've found nests the lyrics under a hierarchy of webpages. The program first has to navigate to a page with many artists, then to one artist's page, then to one album's page and then to one song's page, then finally gets the lyrics from the final page. Although this work's to get a random song's lyrics, it takes a long time to navigate through all those pages. One way I could solve this problem is to find a different database that has less nesting of pages. I could also do less parsing on each page before the final page to run faster. It might also be possible to find a way to go directly to the song's page without going through the rest of the website.
