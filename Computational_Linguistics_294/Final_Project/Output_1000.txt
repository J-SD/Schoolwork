[Tech N9ne]
Hey!! Step right up muthfuckas
And get all the pussy you want
This is the place where you can get all types of pussy!!
We got.. Black pussy, White pussy, Mexican pussy, Chinese pussy
expensive pussy, cheap pussy
If you can find pussy cheaper than ours! (FUCK IT!!)

[Verse 1 Kutt Calhoun]
Now take my bitch
She won’t complain bout shit
Cause she’s my hoe
Kutt is known for tossin’ the dick
Cause when I’m fuckin’
Ain’t nothing more that I do best
Than Beat it up, leave the bra, tired of breath
I’m talkin bout (real sex)
Something regarding the nookie
This act don’t call for a rookie
You get this barred if you can’t submit me
Or call for the pussy
Your resume of the way you lay
When you serenade it
Yonkers, secretions what I’m speakin
Is how you demonstrate
Can’t be no punk with it
Thrust the cock back, with the hump in it
Grab the bitch by the hair
Put your thumb in the booty hoe
And tell the little heffa what you want with it
You gotta be, down for the booty bang
Bottom line this all, cause the money mine
All the nigga really want is the pooty tang
And I’m a sign your pity on the rent a kind (Yeah)
And there’s a whole lot of shit to say
Bitches love it when the dick stay hard
Swithcin’ positions to find some missions
We’ll pull her card
Which one’s the victum (Aey!)
Lick some and get cum sprayed
All over the chest
With the less
You get a double dose of dick a day (Hey!)
(Real sex)

[Chorus Tech N9ne x2]
oooh la la la la
Give it to ya from the back and the side no panties and no bra
Let me get it mama (hit the na na na na)
(Real Sex)
oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, yeah!
I love it when ya do me like this
Baby Bubba and I like it when ya make it do that
(Real Sex)

[Verse 2 Tech N9ne]
At the hotel after the show
The sack ‘n the flow
Never really matters
I’m attacking the hoe
I’m mackin’ her thou
Really slow mo’
I’m never kickin the Willy bobo
Like a pogo - stick
Got your wife screaming oh no - Dick!
In her face on the low oh - Shit!
Got her thinkin’ bout a choo-choo
lovin’ me give me Moo Shoo
Pussy Boo-Koo
On the side of the bed and the back of the couch
Dick slapin’ it south
Tecca Nina is a lot to be bragging about
I be stabbing it out

I like froggy style
Then I crawl right into that doggy style
I’m hella ready
Ima’ call ya Betty and Betty when ya call me, call me Al
Cause it hurts
But ya can’t take it home so ya get it in spurts
That’s how evil lurks
Come off with that skirt

Cause I’m givin’ you the works

You wish ya nigga would do
What I do - So you wanna go this a-way?

[Chorus Tech N9ne x2]

(*talking*)
Yeah yeah yeah, Crock Bull take one
Huh huh, say say say ay

[Chorus - 2x]
What we do blowing this pine, I keep that good
I mean I’m, keeping it gutter I’m keeping it hood
And when I, when I finesse I know I’m the best
I mean I’m, I know that I’m thoed I know that I’m fresh

[Big Pokey]
I know that I’m thoed, I know that I’m fresh
I mean I, I know that I’m cold I know I’m the best
And when I, when I finesse I know I’m the truth
Right now I’m, acting a mess a pest in the booth
We stained it, we stack that cash and stain they brain
And I’m that, I’m that cat they can’t contain
They call me, they call me the boss they know I’m a beast
And they know, they know I’m a feast my record release
The street teams smother the streets, I smother the beats
AK’s cut your lights off, leave you covered in sheets
We stay on, we stay on the low we stay outta drama
Before I, before I fold I’ll be back with my mama
I know I, I know I always be repping the Stone
Just like I, jump on tracks and be wrecking the song
And you a bitch nigga, a girl in a thong
We was playing football, you was split up the tones nigga

[Chorus - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
I’m right back, back in this bitch scratching like a bulldog
The hype around me, got me hopping like a bull frog
Turn on the fogs, holla at them bitches
Felipe in the five fifth, I’m dropping the switches
As long as, as long as we get it we got it we pitching
If you can’t, can’t stand the heat then get outta the kitchen
And if you, if you soft stay outta them trenches
Trenches, full of apes and bulls no doberman pincers
And I got a, fo’ in the soda I po’d in a swisha 
And if baby, if baby get tired she know I’ma bench her
And if she, she was my hoop she know I’ma tip her
Tip her like I’m at the Blue Flame, tipping them strippers
Got that, got the connect diamonds and clipper
My index, my index finger handles the trigger
It’s catch a, catch a square I handled a nigga
It’s straight break a nigga design, dismantle a nigga

[Chorus]

[A3]
Yeah baby, it’s the tanker
3 no games when I aim, that thang at your thinker
Hard like rocks, sweet like chocolate
Throw it in a rapper, finna make a lot of profit
President stacking, the swangs get to acking
The trunk start rattling, slab rock with satisfaction
Remember when a nigga, use to ice the mic
Visualizing bout a Benz, snow icey white
Now I’m fresh, like a pepper out the package
Suave clean, like I use to two step with the Jacksons
Rhyme real breaker, young undertaker
I mean I’m, I’m so throwed X and O’s on you haters
Crossed out lost out, probably in the long house
Baby in her lingerie, po’ing purple Sprite out
Just run away bitch, I’m running my own race
Ma\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1ana equal mo’ dollars, stay the fuck up out my face

[Chorus - 2x]

[Blaxuede]

Mr. 9 on that ass, 504!
Blaxuede...
Man these niggas wanna battle Blaxuede,
What fuckin’ sense that make?
Know what I’m sayin’?
Best to show some skills or somethin’, on the real or somethin’.

Chorus [Blaxuede]:

Don’t ever battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Don’t Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Battle Blaxuede, Battle Blaxuede,
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Don’t Battle Blaxuede, lyrical World Champion,
Battle Blaxuede, battle Blaxuede

First Verse [Blaxuede]:

I bring the ruckus,
Wit a clique of raw muthafuckas,
You can’t duck us,
Or like Hammer you can’t touch us,
These sap suckas, they wanna rain like me,
See I ain’t Method Man, but no one bring the pain like me,
Now instantly I move the crowd like Eric B., and Rakim,
Keep my squad Def like Keith Murray and them,
I’m burying them,
Wack ass, jackass niggas,
Them can’t react fast when I blast ass niggas,
Boy welcome to the nation of Xuede,
Where we kick shit for days like Blade,
Can’t nobody be saved,
And that’s foreal Wootay,
Don’t act Sporty,
The Navy and the Army couldn’t hold me,
They phony,
Not a word from you in seven days like Toni,
I make ya surrender, your rhymes tender like Roni,
Number one nigga, Blaxuede one and only,
It’s lonely at the top, cuz the shit you drop, got nothin’ on me,
I play emcees like a Sony,
Playstation
Breath-taking, and my lyrics can stay Jason,
I ain’t fakin’,
It was Friday the 13th,
I’m so wicked Freddy havin’ nightmares on Elm Street,
Now he too frightened to go to sleep,
I bring the heat,
You remind me of the Son of Samson cuz you weak,
You can’t defeat, we’ll refuse to lose,
I’m bad news cuz I damage all these fools and crews,
WHAT??!!

Chorus

Second Verse [Blaxuede & Mr. 504]

[Mr. 504]

Is you bout that action?
Yes I’m bout that action,
Don’t be slackin’ I could damage you with my rappin’ nigga,
Don’t get mad cuz your bitch chose me nigga,
Don’t get mad cuz your pocket’s on "E" nigga

[Blaxuede]

I know these hard rhymes scarin’ ya,
You started runnin’ cuz you know I’m comin’ when the black clouds fill the 
area,
Deadly like a twenty missile aircraft carrier,
Droppin’ them quickly, I’m an emcee buryer,
Rainin’ on your parade,
Cuz I could kick it for many days in many hardcore different ways,
Murder emcees in different ways, no specific phrase,
Blaxuede, rhymes shine with fatal explicit rays,
Better pray for mankind, cuz last time,
I unloaded and they exploded just like a landmine,
Plus I’m able to kill, niggas at will with the skill,
Can’t prevent what’s bout to happen with a shield, on the real,
It won’t change until I’m deceased in peace,
Even then, my heart and soul still remain in the beats,
Can you stop that?  Nah Black, I doubt that,
Smokin’ all these bitches like Nickels and dime sacks,
Beware of contact, and flames from combat,
If they don’t get stomped, our approach, they fall flat,
What’cha sayin’ brah?
If you ain’t scared, then what’cha prayin’ for?
Guess you finally figured I’m real, and I ain’t playin’, ha?

Chorus

Third Verse [Blaxuede]:

I’m comin’ harder than a virgin on a prom night,
Just get the fuck, don’t come back until your rhymes tight,
Verbal assassin pluggin’ these bitches up like targets,
Don’t cry now, just bow down you got me started,
Whinin’ bout I’m too cold-hearted,
Lyrics too vicious,
Man I’m just handlin’ business, makin’ emcees diminish,
Even if it’s just a scrimmage,
I’m in this to finish
All of my competition,
Soul taker that’s my position, listen,
How many artists, sorry they met me?
I know I’m cold as the fuck, but some high is sweatin’ me,
Already I’m legendary, I just won’t fade,
You’ll be buried in the cemetary fuckin’ with Xuede,
Is it your fantasy?  To be victorious when you battle me?
Or can it be?  You better snap back into reality,
SON, I thought I told you I’m the chosen one,
I be the Golden child, 
Smoke your ass like Black & Mild,
Since I’m wild,
Wild like Wayne,
Wild like the cars that make the color change in little games,
Plus I’m wild like some bees protectin’ a beehive,
Even wild like that station 98.5,
Nigga I’m real
YOU DON’T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON’T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON’T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME
YOU DON’T WANT NONE NIGGA BACK UP OFF ME

Chorus

[Mr. 504]

And we out baby....
What?
Got my nigga big Mac, my nigga Shorty,
Bam Bam, my nigga Tank here with me,
Fa sho, 99
Not only are we 99, but we shine for 99, ya heard me?
Yeah, what?
Don’t fuck with us
We ain’t gonna fuck with you, so don’t fuck with us
Cuz when you fuck with us, we gone fuck with us
So don’t fuck with us
And we won’t fuck with you
Fuck you pay me
What, what?
Don’t battle Blaxuede I thought I told ya

[Blaxuede]

WHAT?????!!!!!!!!

[HAVOC]
Yeah
In the year 1986 
Havoc & Prodeje had a masterplan
To put South Central on the map
And stay strapped
And peel your cap if you trip
And make much snaps 
Like the song say
Our main goal is to stay paid n full

[PRODEJE]
Thinking of a master plan
Cause ain’t nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket all my money is spent so I dig deeper
But still comin up with lint so I
Start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid 
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up
Ain’t nuthin’ funny stop smilin’
Be still, don’t nothing move but the money
But now I learned to earn cause I’m righteous
I feel straight so maybe I might just 
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I’ll stay alive 
So I walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Havoc, Prodeje and a nice big plate of - fish
Which is my favorite dish
But without my money it’s still a wish
Cause I don’t like to dream about gettin’ paid 
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio cause I’m paid in full

Chorus...

Bustin rhymes in the S.C. streets now I’m paid in full 
Bustin rhymes in the S.C. streets now I’m paid in full
Just ride
For my homies on the east and the west side puttin’ it down  
Just ride
For my peoples on the north and the south side puttin’ it down

[PRODEJE]
I gotta stack a end, kickin’ with the G’s
16 switches 64 on gold D’s
Havoc & the Prodeje figure we was ????
But truce never stop even though we still rollin
S.C. streets, we ain’t playa-hated
The rest try to scramble, we’ll never tolerate it
Cause it’s just two players out the cut to get funky
And kick you in the ass like a donkey
G’s make the world go round, I’m talking 6 figure digits
The stuff that makes the Big Willie ????
The illegitimate, mindless ????? I’m payin’ all the ????
Rollin’ through the hood in Armani
The young John Gotti be parlaying, packin 44’s
Swervin’ through yo’ hood, smashin’ those 
Bustas, who thought I had a minimum flow
But on a scale from 1 to 10 I’m like a 9.0

Chorus...

Verse 1:
We rollin’ five cars deep, all logo thangs:
A Cutty, a Caddy, two OJ’s and a drop Mustang.
My nigga’s fucked in the Cutty gettin’ donuts, fishtail
And smokin’ up the block and "Two hun’ed block" is what he yellin’.
Hyped as fuck, gone of the Hen and dank,
Bitches all over the place, jockin’ niggas off gold Daytons.
6-7 lock is what I’m rollin’ when it’s sunny.
Fo’ figured, five block to keep my shit runnin’.
Gold thangs, spin in pearl pains, shinin’
And everywhere I go, niggas ask if they can buy in.
Bitches jock everywhere I go,
That’s why I roll solo at the sideshows.
Creepin’, peepin’ out these hoes,
Cuz the first one to look is the first to get chose.
So come take a ride and let me show you how it’s done,
Up in the state of Cali-funk-ia.
Nigga.

(chorus x2)
Roll, roll, roll yo’ voges up and down the street.
All the niggas drop the tops and hit the spot, if you’re ridin’ on gold
D’s.

Verse 2:
Sippin’ on some hindu, blowin’ on some indo,
Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
chrome.
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain’t ne’er be mine,
Hungarian P.R., now I’ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin’
job.
It’s funk in the town of the fog.
Too many deaths, ain’t nobody down for the squad.
Rollin’ plushed out exact like your Cadillac,
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin’ tracks from Vice,
Can’t wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight.
You know them sound recycled clubs,
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a glocks
and then a bunch of unknown damn buds.
Niggas poppin’ the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus’, Caddy paint wit drops what’s out, pushin’ a
Bump.
Y’knaw’t’s how we do it in the town and I was cold,
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues.

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut’n nice, it’s like life, I’m livin’ off in my buildin’s,
Slangin’ that ‘caine, get regular cash back, a nigga’s spillin’.
Ready and willin’ for some freaks to leap off in these streets,
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin’ around with one of these ammos
under they belts.
More niggas I’m killin’ than killed, then I be up on tilt.
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas.
Mug, that’s when I’m slug-killed, still makin’ these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin’ I’ll think it him and dark kill.
It was a thrill, comin’ up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this.
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf,
A young nigga that’s showin’ off, ready steady pushin’ that work.
Pushin’ a Caddy on Originals and Voges,
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud’fuck’s.

(chorus till fade)

[Ann Peebles sample]
He’s my sunshine, and the love he give, yeah
Gonna set me free, yeah

[‘Fist of the North Star’ sample]
Alright, if you’re that eager to die, I’ll oblige you
Anytime you’re ready

[Li-Mouse]
Knickolist, Cno & Mouse, we come in three
If you roll with us, you know you rolling with these
Hip hop assassins, niggas, keep asking
How we murder MC’s, just by rapping
Zero Gunz clapping, don’t ask what happened
By the time you get answers, we already laughing
I kill mics, the style, unnoticed
Like peace in the Mid East, your chance is hopeless
Against someone with the, style like such
I keep shit moving like you stepping on the clutch
Rapidly, scatter through your mind with time
To scramble your thoughts, shit must be a crime
Fucking faggots, heh, ya’ll can keep at it
I leave your whole shit framed like Roger Rabbit
Ya’ll can’t see me, you a bunch of a rats
I’mma ask that frog to give you a bunch of ‘smacks’

[Cno Evil]
Get smacked in slow motion, smooth silky white lotion
Leave your brain sprained and drained, wet like an ocean
What’s the commotion, move, get tossed off my track
There’s no room for the filthy and the wack, nope, nope
Just the elite, three man team move on the scene
Martin Luther King dreams, wear our hearts on the sleave
With our adrenaline up, ‘cranked’ up, like Jason Statham
Transporting track sensations, to your radio stations
Cno Evil, move with the Mouse and the Knowledge
Your rhymes is liquid, mines is hard solid
Birds wings get chopped off, fucking with the rock soft
Struggling the locks off, breaking
I’m done with lecturing, I’m entering your brain
I’m entering your dames off the stength of the name
Observation (sample: Come on!) look and observe
Wonderful words, blurs coming in thirds, you heard?

[‘Fist of the North Star’ sample]
Death shouldn’t be rushed, one should savor it like fine wine
And enjoy it’s aroma, but if in consideration of your impatience
I must kill you now, so be it

[Knickolist Knowledge]
You know Knick had to come through, with the crew, crack the brew
Get on the mic and spit, what he do for me and you
The Knowledge is here, products seem to be everywhere
Like old scent in your atmosphere, move underground
With The Rodentz like Splinter’s lair
On the sounds that’s priceless and rare
Triple power bar charges first verses to share
Three kings with golden bars, similar to street
I for two spar to get better, now every letter
So listen as we get nice on the device
Display raw talent, spit precise
Four hundred fifty six ways to kick it like the dice
Knickolist, change visuals with verbal miracles
Animes heard for the third, speak, peep it with the words
To get ready, you heard?

Ahhh... Fearless Four... Well, I’ll be back for more...

[DLB]

DLB’s on top of all of the rest when I’m

[Tito]
You know the rhymes are so bad when they come to me

But I know that there’s no other, quite like Tito when I’m
Rockin it... rockin it

[Mike C]
Well I’m a million dollar boy and a billion dollar man
and if you got it I can get it with a wave of my hand
Got a voice so nice never say rhymes twice
Never have to explain, because I’m so precise
And if you ever wanna battle, you better prevent
The Mighty Mike C! MC President when I’m
Rockin it... rockin it

[Peso]
Well let’s get right down to the bottom of things
We’re here to get you on the floor with the music we bring
Smurfin out, shake bake and rattle n roll
Dance to the jazzy rhymes of the Great Peso
Comin out like a winner from the startin gate
Endin up like a champ you know, so great
I may be last on the line, but I’m one of the best
Can’t you hear, my rhymes are funky fresh when I’m
Rockin it... rockin it

And we’re rockin it... rockin it
And you’re rockin it... rockin it

[Fearless Four]
Now, even as we play
There’s a new wave of sound goin’ on today
We know your time is very precious so we won’t stall
We’ll just put some words together and tell you all
How we’re Rockin it...(rockin it y’all) Rockin it

It’s the computer rhyme, a new electrical shock
Consisting of weird noises all around the clock
But of course music plays along cause it’s a must
So let us tell you who does all of this for us
(O.C) He stands up behind the strong
(O.C) He keeps the beat on time for so long
(O.C) Goes along dance, rhyme or song
(O.C) The Master won’t steer you wrong when he’s
Rockin it... rockin it!

(Crazy Eddie) In my opinion, no.1 protege
(Crazy Eddie) There ain’t a record that he can’t play
(Crazy Eddie) See him once and I know you’ll say
(Crazy Eddie) Can hold his ground against any DJ when he’s
Rockin it... rockin it!

Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh yeah? OH YEAH.

Straight murda (Division), this is gangsta right here
C.C.F., yeah, bring it back home, nigga

[Shacronz]
Fort Green PJ’s, rest in B.K.
Hop up when you see me, run the streets like relays
Did time, sold crack, you got weed, roll that
New rims, blue Benz, who them with them throwbacks
Freemurda, Shacrizzy, dirty, plus raw bizzy
Rip shows, get dough, only hoes ride with me
Fuck what they all say, hustle in the hallway
That white shit you call yae, 145th and Broadway
Never been a crook frontin’, ‘Cronz ready to jook somethin’
Bitch nigga, we make it known when we took somethin’
Surrounded by some thug shit, Nieta, Kings, Bloods, Crips
Crack spots, number hoes, black cops, I love this, where you from?

[Chorus: Freemurder (Shacronz)]

[Freemurder]
Aiyo, I’m still here, Air Force 1’in’ it

Right with ya, drunk off that white liquor
Gray goose might hit ya, over the melon
Who you tellin’, we get right nigga
This is J-Freemurder, got it from his poppa
Known as Big Free Turner
Cuffie, did you touch me, yo my goons gon’ squeeze burners
Pimp halls, ain’t a sucker, gettin’ balls, take the Rucker
Fifth jaw, bang your hummer, forget yours, take a number

[Chorus]

[Freemurder]
Your boy be the mack like Max Julian
Tote gats, two of them
Right on ‘em, stay with some Nike’s on ‘em
Lay back, slick fucker, look how we switch numbers
On that Benz-o, you know how the rims go
Never stop spinnin’, that’s how them little chickens
Never stop grinnin’, that’s how the seven got women
(Regular!) Pull over, while ya’ll in the hood sober
Bored as hell, not noticin’ I took over

[Shacronz]
I’mma keep cockin’, heat poppin’
Out the club, inches, beat knockin’
That shit that got that Jeep lockin’
Get money, buy clothes, sick, hungry, rise slow
Sittin’ on Mickey tires, hittin’ that 5-0
Violate, we must kill, whole team, bust steele
In 90, my projects shut down, Deville
Seen a lot of rebels try, first the dude pedals by
Since ‘85, my hood known to let the metal fly

[Chorus 2X]

[Intro]
Ah Collipark, HOMEBWOI
Collipark, HOMEBWOI
Collipark in the buildin, HOMEBWOI
YEP! ... YEP!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hard hittin, back breakin, everybody out they seats
Man the world is watchin me, the world is watchin me

[Homebwoi]
Look here, come one come all and get to it
Pimp game immaculate, flow like fluid
Collipark in the buildin, ya already knew it
Y’all boy game is weak, I see through it
Bankroll is fat, you girls can’t chew it
All this is mine, you boys just blew it
Shucks, ain’t it a shame how I mack
Women they comin in crowds, now look how I act
Make a little shorty cotton on that
V.I.P. at the Grammy Awards, now top that
Mr. Collipark, keep the money comin in
Puffy don’t party like the Ying Yang Twins
Cadillac boy, mack down to the end
Peace, stones or conflicts, shorty we all in
Homebwoi’s the name, I gotta represent
If you’re lookin for change, it’s where it’s gon’ begin

[Chorus]

[Homebwoi]
It’s like the world got binoculars on
Tryin to find me like Waldo, we all know they lookin for homes
Had to get mad at the woman cause they teachin ‘em wrong
Too many pullin on me, I politely tell them to go on
I’m a hustler by day, baller by midnight
One at a time ladies, lil’ momma please sit tight
They got they mouths wide open, boy I’m pimp tight
And a Bentley you could never get - why? It’s a prototype
I got the Birdman stuntin for the show tonight
You want to hate, but you cain’t, cause you know I’m right
Paint job out of sight, gotta thrill ‘em
Like the moon on the street lights when I kill ‘em
Twenty-six inches, that’s what I’m tellin ‘em
Doors open up like the wings of a pelican
Eight 15’s in the trunk, in the floor
Bass beatin through your chest, what your heart beatin for?

[Chorus]

[Homebwoi]
Shorty don’t know I ball, I’m like YEP~!
Askin me to buy her a drink so I STEP~!
Grippin G8, Griptown what I GRIP~!
Grindin, got to this money while y’all slipped
OKAYYYYY~! But I’m not Lil’ Jon
Poppin my collar, I’m the man like The Fonz
Look I got that bounce back like sponge
Yo’ pockets dehydrated; look like they got the runs
My time, my money, that’s real
My chain, my peeps, my grill
Me and mine, that’s just how I live
Money over broads, that’s just how it is
Homebwoi, yo’ girl, I train
Break bread let you pop that thang
Fall up in the club I’ma make a little rain
Money mighty pimpin, won’t ya kiss the pinky rang

[Chorus] - 2X

[Vast Aire]
Yo see me chilling at the throne with a Viking cup
You can catch a beat down or get beat up
Eh, it’s on you to choose
Some might say it’s on you to lose
Cannibals are here and we love to chew
Pete Rock did the beat don’t get it confused
This is serious (I’m serious!)
My chemical romance is weed and booze
So don’t get me started
Cuz we can all act ill and get retarded
Like a paraplegic with ski’s on
Sorta like Christopher Reeve with a cape on
Bring ya army, bring mad troops
I’ll just open my suit in the phone booth
Eh, and now it’s on
Unless you got the green I’m repping Krypton

(Hook) Vast Aire
I tap dance on fingers (On fingers!)
So if you knew the ledge you wouldn’t be holding on
Queens (Get up!) - Bronx (Get up!) - Brooklyn, Staten

I tap dance on fingers (On fingers!)
So if you knew the ledge you wouldn’t be holding on
Queens (Get up!) - Bronx (Get up!) - Brooklyn, Manhattan

[Break]
See that’s what I’m talking ‘bout
I’ll flow so ill we like Hurricane cash

[Vordul Mega]
Tryna live, gon’ thru it since we was kids
Our livelihood is writing rhymes, blowing buddha in cribs
Seriously animated and spit
Rhyming for those implicating they sick, we nice
Eva since ninja stars and spray cans in the waste lands
Now it’s all about lasers, displaying raps in baseheads
Bumping beats on streets, pumping CDs and watching for PD
When crashing colorful weed leaves outta plastic bags
Match the meds, hook the portable decks
Blasting tracks after that vision’s apocalyptic
Like you was tripping off acid tabs
On an average path we be crashing crafts, blowing Indian hash
Saved by seat belts and airbag, popping outta dash
And the batch still wanna push us in wax
Cuz we move fast, dipping in traffic
Gon’ thru the madness with no ration
But we live it, matter of fact
Over fiction, friction, thru twisted communications
Listening, straight whispering

(Hook) Vast Aire

[Break 2]
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up


I gots to rock the freakin mic, and yes I gots to rock the show,
but when the stress hits me, yo, it’s like 10 blows to the head,
I’m always being hasseled, there’s no end,
hasseled by my Moms and hasseled by the feds,
pressure rising and I’m feeling really tired,
they look into my future and see ‘nigga for hire’,
stay outta trouble, but I gots to break some rules,
no love to the brothers that were cruel,
but now whenever people act like that, 
they wants to see my flop but I cuts no slack,
My head’s pumpin in and out of my brain,
all the stress is causin mental pain,
however, any type of weather, I can rock the show and sit back and live
forever (and ever),
I try to block everything out of mind,
no peace in my life, well not that I can’t find,
My life is so confusing,
I don’t know who’s doing the playing or doing the using,
I’m getting dissed, even by my principle,
you say you’re not in shit and say your not incapable,
buk-buk-buk, Brown goes down,
another concussion of the hip-hop sound,
I strive in my life to keep my heart pumping,
gots to do my job and keep the crowd jumpin,
dealin with this and that, can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus:

Can I get a yo, Can I get a yo, Can I get a yo?
(Yoooooo!)
Can I get a ho, Can I get a ho, Can I get a ho?
(Hoooooo!)

Verse 2:

Yo, you never left me rest,
yes, you keep me 24 stressed,
criticized by my mom ‘cause my pants sag,
don’t wanna go home, don’t wanna hear the nag,
I gotta go the the studio and release my stress with the funky fresh flow,
and just as I get to the peak of rap singing, ding-a-ling-a-ling, the phone
starts ringing,
and I know what’s gonna happen,
some kind of bad news suds up my rappin’,
I get a record to do, I gotta perform, I go to be rough, but yo, I can only
do so much,
so hey,
hey diddle diddle,
when you start fighting, Frankie’s in the middle,
and now you want to pick sides,
so I don’t go home, don’t answer the phone, so I can hide,
‘cause if I do, I gotta dis one of you,
nobody really understands what I be going through,
forget this shit,
I gotta try to get a grip, or I might just slip, or my lid might flip,
and sometimes I wish I could switch, aggrivate my brain, just like an itch,
walked all over like a doormat,
can I get a break can I get a kit-kat,
or can I get a yo, can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus

Verse 3:

Can’t get no shut eye, always gots the pen to my hand,
wanna close my lid, saying to myself I know now I can like the little engine
that could,
try to explain to my Moms, but she never understood,
the way we gotta do this thing, I head for the microphone and I drop my swing,
used to be slippin, now I got a grip,
90% in math, now I’m that tip,
back to the fact, I’m on the bus, gotta finish my rhyme, on the way to
studio check it about that time,
the pressure just killin my brain cells,
gotta do this and that ringin through my head like a bell,
gotta stay on track, stay on track,
define what’s good, bad, phat and wack,
didn’t succeed when I tried to run away from it all,
I came back then I heard my blue pen call,
I’m still striving to reach my goal,
can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus

[Verse 1]
Went from more marsh clears than mackage
Her man start M series the package
A good dude need a bad bitch
It’s no reekin when the max lit
Still creepin with my last chick
Was pamperin niggas, trainin em how to have shit
Did a whole, fuck all I have shit
The winter too long to act like I never had shit
Pimp still on, winnin feel some
Said the young talent was swag like Ben Grill’s son
Shots hittin the center, they tryina kill some
Quarter mill done, niggas slit like when the bill come
But thank God I know how to make shit
In ghetto gutter go in to take shit
Niggas we bank after bank, we try to rape shit
Then go drink after drink, and celebrate shit
Same class with street legends
Deep measures with niggas that blast the heat better
Funny style, don’t laugh but speak clever
Dark knights, get you killed faster than Heath Ledger
Rap bane, 2 guns Max Payne
Pac came for the worst shower, Jack Chain
You catch change when getting some trap change
Arrogant, act strange, I’m cocky I act damed
Dash at me, you give me the ass pass you
65 clash you I be the swag master
Sensei Bentley washed in wax after
Hit all stars in the morn then sax after
If you ask for it, the arm lift
Rose is on the dashboard like one zip
Black everything, chrome rims, my arm sick
Knockin every track out without a bomb fist

[Chorus]
The game whack so I’m bout to get
Niggas in the trap like what’s happennin
They wanna see a nigga rap again
I ain’t on it but the homies not havin it
Niggas talk that fly shit,
I does that, that’s my shit
They like V you ain’t comfortable
You don’t come from money, you ain’t a Huxtable

[Verse 2]
I feel like a when he put out the Vanquish
Or like Ec when that SL was dangerous
It’s too hot for these fake shits
I done got too hot was on my main shit
I played the block where ox rot and jay sit
Put my money on poo, G spot, he acin
I got 3 spots I’m chasin,
Dolla for dolla, servin out of my basement
I see a lot of replacements, we lean on you like we gotta be wasted
Just take what’s out of the safe then
Too many keys, said he gotta be maintenance
I’m in the T top slot, it’s been a month you niggas only rewind once,
Sellin d brown while d block buck,
In the town I put 8 balls like a Reebok tuck
Ah, you can smell the piff, ain’t gotta open the bag you could tell it’s it,
Yeah import her a bag it’s what you tell this bitch
That’s all corny and sad, I can tell you bitch

[Chorus]
The game whack so I’m bout to get
Niggas in the trap like what’s happennin
They wanna see a nigga rap again
I ain’t on it but the homies not havin it
Niggas talk that fly shit,
I does that, that’s my shit
They like V you ain’t comfortable
You don’t come from money, you ain’t a Huxtable

[Intro]
Yeah! Hahahahahaha...
BRRAP! HEAVY METAL KINGS~!!
Billy Idol, Vinnieapazy

[Vinnie Paz]
It’s a burgundy bath, everybody get turned into ash
Bein evil just somethin I made my personal task
The G36 put you in surgery fast
Everybody die regardless who first or who last
Death almost got me twice but he mercifully passed
I’ll take your face off without usin surgical masks
I wouldn’t call it an ego but I’m certainly gassed
This isn’t the Desert Eagle but it certainly smash
If I don’t get money from rhymin that’s a fateful day
I might have to take it back to the kitchen like Rachel Ray
I don’t put no work in with bitches, I’m tryin to scrape today
Anywhere in my environment is not the place to play
If I’m hungry in need of food I’ll pull a skully down
I don’t fuck with workers I’m gunnin whoever run the town
I got enough clips with me to spit a hundred rounds
I’m the father of Christ and y’all are just the son of clowns
I don’t think that y’all can fuck with Vinnie but let’s see
I’ma have this fuckin llama lookin like Jet Li
Everybody who is anybody respects me
I’ll have you bleedin out your back like it’s a jet ski

[Chorus 2X: Ill Bill]
Motherfucker, what’s really real, really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with Israeli steel, yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes, and car seats
You die on the Belt Parkway next to Canarsie

[Ill Bill]
Brutal tribes indulge in slavery and human sacrifice
The shooters pack devices capable of provin lack of life
with no compassion, ratchet action, flashy fashion, blast for cash
Assassins faster than the flash, amass a body count, surpass the sound barrier
and shattered by the splatter, rattled you
Wakin shakin sober, gats that kick back and dislocate your shoulder
Decapitate your head and chop you in half, pop you and laugh
Rock you in gas, find you amongst the cowards and fast
Find me holdin the rifle on the watchtower with plans
So never underestimate me or the power of Paz
Lock you in the room with the lion, now how would you last?
You can’t fight the king of the jungle, he’ll devour you fast
Put you underneath the dirt next to the flowers and grass
At the funeral mommas and dads get showered with gats
You kill one us and we’ll kill one of you, counterattack
Thousands of stacks, from hustlin these powders and cracks

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
I fuckin pick and peel your chain, Official Pistol Gang
From Kill Devil Hills to Pennsylvania we be grippin change
You little pencil brains, before I lose to you
I’ll cut my nuts and slit my veins, all y’all do is bitch complain
Henny and pills, plenty of steel
On the block with 50’s and krill, word to Vinnie and Bill
In South Philly for real, my hood is guineas and Campbells
Niggaz and dirty Irish who think that they Sam Crow
And oh, my fan know the stream fuck the man yo
No "Book ‘em Danno," you ain’t Rambo
They’ll put, 20 in your hand bone when my fam roam
That’s when the grams go, soft white, my niggaz call it that damn snow
And fuck hip-hop, I got sick pot in ziplocks
I get from stoners in Cali, rockin flip flops
One brand is called Sit-Stop cause after one hit
that bitch’ll have you "Dancing With the Stars" like Rick Fox

[Chorus]

[Sabac Red]
Yo we have walked back together to gorillas and wolves
The illest of goons, the room is filled with killers and booze
Pretty soon we breakin in your office building with tools
Assassinate the CEO for catchin feelings and moods
The seal of the moon, got us raisin hell on the block
If they manipulate us like a pretty face and smelly twat
Tell me what is power, cash, handguns, and hoorah
A brutal task between thieves, priests, nuns, and Qu’rans
I’m on a path that has the cast, cast bigger and better things
I’ve been with veteran medicine men headed to Medellin
Brin the noise and avoid the vicious cycle of prison
It’s all "Poison," Kool G. Rap, Michael Bivins
Speed of NASCAR, VROOM, Madagascar soon
Consume a rock star whom, Allahu Akhbar boom
Wounded and killed, rumors are real, Israeli steel
Caught your peoples in the grill, now the tomb has been sealed

[Outro]
YO!!!

[Talking]
In the beginning was the word
and the word was with Allah
and the word was Allah,
nothing would exist, if Allah did not create it
nothing would exist, if Allah did not create

Let’s go back on a track and embark
On a trip thru space to a time and place when everything was dark
Afar from many star, remotely distant
In the beginning when life was non-existent
Allah created himself, Allah self-created
all-knowledge before man first originated
From the Son of Man, but he begotten out the sun
For Allah is one, and besides him there is none
But still it was dark, not a spark in the night
So from the mind, he shined, and blind like a divine light
And than in a cosmic burst, a star dispersed
And first began to expand thru-out the universe
So light was shed and spread to infinity
And the stars, the sun and moon, would soon began to BE
As planets evolved and revolved like satellites
In orbit to absorb the rays of sunlight
Rotating and spinning, beginning to take form
Until gradually, the galaxy was born
Than Allah gave birth, to the planet Earth
The land, The Heavens and the seven seas
And made it one of the nine planets to circle the sun
As it spun, at 360 degrees
Than clouds were formed which stormed and brought forth rain
To quicken the Earth and moisten the dry terrian
And seeds were sewn and grown and soon grass would shoot
As trees would root and began to bear to fruit
The land was divided by oceans and great seas
Wit rivers that ran like the Nile and Euphrates
And fish swam and birds flew thru the skies
And animals roamed the plain and they too multiplied
As each and every living thing began to sing
Giving praise to The King
For bringing life and love and peace and harmony, will manifest
Than Allah blessed the night, as the sun set in the west
As it turned to face the east, giving grace
Now you’re driftin’ thru space

[Hook]
You’re driftin’ thru space, driftin’ thru space, driftin’ thru space
Now close your eyes and visualize and realize
That we’re all driftin’ thru space

From black dirt
Allah created and prostrated the first man and had him
Giving the name of Adam
Incised out like the fetal position
within a mothers womb, still in total submission
To the will of Allah, but he was soon to be awoken
Stretching forth until darkness was broken
Than he sat upright, in the light of truth
Sang ‘Allah-u-akbar’ for his life is proof
That Allah is Merciful, The Most-Benevolent
And Knower-Of-All, for he is All-Intelligent
Than he chose to rise and rose and began to stand tall
And became Khalifah for over all,
the living things, thru-out the planet Earth
And given the keys to this great universe
Than he first realized that Allah had uplifted him
Wit knowledge and wisdom and mentally gifted him
So he bowed his head and seven times he softly said
‘Glory be to my LORD, The Great’ and tears were shed
But tears of joy for Adam was more than grateful
Was still alone and without a mate until
Woman was made to compliment the man
And co-exist in paradise when life begin
From a single pair, the first trace of the human race
As we drift thru space

[Hook]
We’re driftin’ thru space, driftin’ thru space, driftin’ thru space
Now close your eyes and visualize and realize
That we’re all driftin’ thru space

.
.
[Chorus] 

[Male (Brian Urso)]
From across the room I; I seen You watching Me
I know you seen me watching you, Ooh ooh ohh

[Female]
From across the room I; I seen You watching Me
I know you seen me watching you, Ooh ooh ohh

[Rip Verse 1] 
Heey
A little bit late but I’m finally here
had to step it up like I’m walkin up stairs
with your girl on my arm and a cup full of beer
gettin drunk in here and in luck interferes the heey...
who am I to turn her away?
listen up I got something to say...
My bad that it took all day, aye aye aye
you there, with the blue hair
what I gotta do here to make you move
say you got a crew here, shorty who cares
just do what you do
say you had two beers, drink like it’s New Years
this one’s for you
cause you standing like you can get it
ask around girl, and they’ll tell you how I rip it

[Chorus x2] 

[Rip Verse 2] 
This party is so gnarly
everywhere you smell that Bob Marley
everybody acting so retardy
sippin Bacardi with a chick like Barbi
but I’m more equipped than Ken
and she got a poker face so I’m goin all in
but when I poke her face then I choke her face
and that motivates us to procreate, Heeey
Patron got us all getting naked.
And we gotta stay high like spaceships
but you know I got you covered like blankets
gonna party like it’s college man
I hope somebody tapes it
swag on point like lasers
take you home and record like a blank disk
I’m not sure what this is but I drank it
gonna party til the morning, everybody getting faded

[Chorus x2] 

[Rip Bridge] 
And I don’t wanna go to class, I wanna Party!
And I don’t wanna go to work, I wanna Party!
And I don’t wanna grow up, I wanna Party!
And I don’t want this night to end, I wanna Party!

[Rip Verse 3] 
I can see you watching me
who else would you be looking at?
I’m gonna take everything I want
Give me that, give me this
Give me this, give me that
Now sit on my lap
and tilt your head back
we kiss and we chat
and after this it’s a wrap

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus One 2X: BJ The Chicago Kid]
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin’, church in the mornin’

[Interlude: Buddy]
Hopefully we can go to Heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to Heaven, cause I’m stayin’
Hopefully we can go to Heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to Heaven, cause I’m stayin’, I’m stayin’

[Jeremih]
Yeah, I got a dilemma because it’s a Saturday, wish it was Friday
Touch in the mornin’, +Confessin’+ to Usher, she say she want +My Way+
I don’t want massin’, no blessing tonight girl, been sinnin’ for way long
If you gon’ get on your knees, that’s a problem that I gotta pay for
She know I’m down for anything when she started poppin’ that
I don’t wanna bite that apple girl cause it ain’t no turnin’ back (no no no)
I don’t know how I end up with all that ass up on her, what she did to me?
Tats on her and it’s temptin’; clap it, can I get a witness?

[Chorus Two: Jeremih]
Say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin’, service in the mornin’
She say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin’, church in the mornin’

[Lil Durk]
Girl you told me you had church in the A.M., A.M. 
It’s a war going on so stay in, stay in
Homie caught a case, I seen him take 10
And I knew him since the playpen, amen
Got church in the mornin’
I, pray for the poor, I, wish she was rich
Plus she the preacher’s daughter, eatin’ cornbread and cabbage
Ain’t miss a Sunday mornin’, or damn near nothin’
Wishin’ me and her can go to Heaven
Thinkin’ I’m a devil with that Porsche 911
Talkin’ to that pussy, I’m just preachin’ like a reverend
We could only kick it cause we leavin’ at 11
All white got me feelin’ godly
I just wanna do this, feed the family
Shawty she my angel cause she got me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah - preach to ‘em

[BJ] She said...

[Chorus One]

[BJ The Chicago Kid]
Ooh; I’ma tell you flat out, baby I want in
Maybe we could ride out, before this song ends
Fuck your friends
I know they wanna fuck me too, well baby we can fuck your friends
And if they down baby, I’m ready, g-strings ain’t shit but spaghetti
Smokin’ weed up like confetti
She said she want a real one, well baby I’m the truth (yeah)
Kinda like a young ass nigga named Jigga mixed with Nas when he had the chipped tooth
+If I, Ruled, The World+, baby
I’d put in that work, but a nigga still gotta go to church

[Chorus One] + [Interlude]

[BJ - over Interlude]

Yeah, I pray

[Chorus - Twista]

[repeat Chorus]

(Trina)
Oh nigga you mad now, actin bad, pullin out your gats now
All you care about is cash, so my feelings they assed out
And it’s so sad how I do for you
Be the woman come through for you
When you do wrong, police come through for you
I’ll even bend the truth for you
but the fact of the matter is
nigga you gon’ love who you gon’ love
You gon’ trust who you gon’ trust
You gon’ fuck who you gon’ fuck
but you wont trust me, no way no how
ya gotta give ya whole life fo a nigga nowadays
Can’t leave your house, can’t even speak your mouth
Can’t even beat him down
Motherfuckers is so crazy, deranged
Let ‘em into your brain brings misery and pain
Cause they call us lame, bitches, and heffers, and sluts
You think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts
Bitches ya’ll better get tough
and at the same time y’all better lock the game
And re-rock the game
Get a glock ready, sit back cock and aim
And try to stop the pain, cause you got a lot to gain
instead of sittin home waitin on niggas to call
puttin 911 in their beepers and all
we don’t deserve this at all y’all

[Chorus] - 2X

(Trina)
nigga how you tame a bitch
talkin bout your game legit when you ain’t the shit?
then get wit a chick don’t maintain a bitch you restrain a bitch
insecure niggas they blame a bitch then reign a bitch
get a ring try to rename a bitch get an attitude
play games with the dick and try to tame a bitch
y’all niggas better critically acclaim a bitch
you call we come take it like a champ drink all your cum
do a lot of shit ive never done so I keep my cool
cuz I ain’t the one to start actin up
Cause he keep a bitch from backin up
i wanna pack my stuff but mama said I cant come back to her
oh lord so I had keep askin ya
for help outta situations killin up my whole life
I’m in love with a thug and he ain’t treatin my soul right
and I know I don’t see him uh don’t need him
shit fuck him and feed him
fish stuck him and leave him quick shit...

[Chorus] - 2X

(Trina)
if you’re a nigga with no love and don’t want no bitch
don’t see no bitch don’t need no bitch
then don’t tease no bitch shit
cuz we don’t need to be
fucked up mentally like a dumb ho
breakin out all your windows
Tell the po-po’s bout your dope holes, oh no
I can get my own shit my own nigga my own dick
I don’t need a nigga thinkin that he own a bitch
cuz he bought me shit
7 whole days ain’t call a bitch shit
nigga shoulda stayed right where he was at
cuz the nigga layed right where he was at
the nigga shoulda died right where he was at
better watch yo back

[Chorus] - 3X

[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!

[Verse 1]
Yo, come along this way, it’s Burning Star all night all day
I’ll put my vibes on play and never stop until they say " Ok Ok Ok..
Ok, Ok, Ok, those Words you say are true in fact
But don’t delay talking that, the reasons why we co-created
Burning Star
We walk like Warriors, in Babylon my word is Bond
I know we’ve gone this far, but still we have to keep it on
Your word is Bond, Right or Wrong, they bring the War, we bring the calm
Just like a Storm, we rain Supreme, this ain’t a dream although it seems..

[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!

[Verse 2]
We intrigue all those who never discipline their deeds
And the chosen are few, so it’s our destiny to lead
In physical form, we storm this world of conviction
We Love the Righteous and Poor and keep our lessons non-fiction
so listen and heed, you must build like a Slave
To live like a King, in these lands of the Brave
Where the Warriors run, not from Fear or from Gun
But from the call of their Spirit, ever chasin’ the Sun!

[Chorus]
Warriors...Come out and Play!
Warriors...Come out and Play!

Riding through the city, {uh} foot on the gas
My destination to get it so if I pass
You can’t blame me because I’m trying to cash
In on the opportunity if it don’t last
At least you know I tried, at least you know I di-i-i-i-id
Everything I could for my city to get it in {uh}
I’m so Maryland 410 til I die,
East coast skills with a west coast style {style}
Classified in a custom you can’t design/
I’ve mastered the art of passion and putting it inside my drive
That’s priceless but, this an expensive ride
To success you thought it wasn’t a price
To pay by day to get where you aim
No money I’m just talking the pain it’s insane
How my city overlooked hidden in states
No matter where I go I’ll make sure that they know the name...

{Hook 1:08} Repeat 2x
Cuz I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
Yeah I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
Oh yeah, I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
With my city on my back {back}, with my city on my back {back}

{Verse 2 1:31}
Young and ambitious, never had a hand out
It’s hard to get assistance when people know that you stand out
All they see is competition, all I did was work to get it
When you at the bottom you figure out ways to make a living
People take this all for granted, Imagine not having
A place to stay a pot to piss in
I taught myself growing up you should never listen
To anybody tryna kill your dreams, they didn’t get theirs
Life can be a circus, yeah you know it’s not fair
I’ve been well aware playing musical chairs
I’m just tryna get the last spot, you know that I can’t stop
Channeling my progression, make them haters mad watch
Who am I, not to be the one they wanna ask bout
Malik Ferraud, Maryland I do it for my fam block
People wanna show me love, people wanna hate
But, at the end of the day this is what I gotta say

{Hook 2:16} Repeat 2x
Cuz I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
Yeah I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
Oh yeah, I’m grinding {grinding} {grinding} {grinding}
With my city on my back {back}, with my city on my back {back}

[Fieldy]
Burn down to the ground everything I own 
Everything you need is temporary 
And everything you want is so petty 
Materialistic shit makes me sick 
You’re through with your cars, your house, your money 
It’s just for now doesn’t sound funny 
Your wife, your kids your family, your life 
It’s just for now it’s just not right
Open your eyes and you’ll see the light 
Stop living in a fairytale life 
There’s more to life than just living 
Find it in yourself and start giving 
It’ll come back to you no one’s out to sue you 
I lost everything I had I’m not even mad 
Losing everyone I love will make me sad
If you dwell on the past you simply gonna last

Chorus: Jonathan Davis
 
You will not take my mind
You will not take what’s mine 
You think you can hurt me by stealing from me (oh why)
You think I owed to you
This is everything I do
You rape me take from me
But you ain’t got me
 
[Fieldy]
This pain and misfortune is pure fucking hell
Take it away nothing will change
 I will still Feel the same this is too much pain 
Am I being Tortured time will only tell 
Am I insane or am I in hell 
Gotta have faith not someone to scorch it 
Live your own life no reason to rebel 
All of this hatred this has to be hell 
Feeling down on yourself try living my life
More money more problems that ain’t no lie 
If you take it all away I rather scream bye 
Day by day one day at a time 
Doesn’t make me gay It takes a man to cry 
Your not alone wipe that tear from your eye 
Life is a gift you should put it on a throne 
Not materialistic shit appreciate your life
 
Chorus
 
[Fieldy]
I can’t wait to die (die) if it’s up to me 
I wouldn’t be alive (alive) not suicidal
But I’ve had a rough life drugs will make 
You dumb but they won’t kill your pain
Look at the bright side I’m trying to stay 
Sane I would never take my life over 
Depression and pain that’s just part of life 
Life, life it’s just a test treat it with respect 
You’re here for a reason not to be depressed

Chorus x 2

[HOOK]
It ain’t always umbrellas in the rain
It ain’t always umbrellas in the rain

It ain’t always umbrellas in the rain
It ain’t always umbrellas in the rain

[Verse 1]
Welcome you’ve just entered my life
as I re-tell it on the mic
see you get the flashes
but I see the brights
I’m outside, so tell me
what do you want me to rap about
My pain, my depression
my anger and agression
or these pills that I should be taking
or the ones that I am
and let me tell you what I can’t stand
How your favorite rapper has five ghostwriters
He does pop art, a pop tart, let em get the toaster
but let me just chill and hold my composure
Cause he probably sold five mill...
and I’m trying to sell my CD for five bills
so I can retire and get a crib in the hills
get a pile of pills and hit exile with thrills
Cause I been walking with no umbrella for way to long
with rihanna just singing that song
cause I ain’t got no fucking umbrella
naw, I ain’t got no fucking umbrella
ella, ella, ella

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now imagine if I was you and you was me
living this hip hop dream with a movie theme
an artist trying to draw attention
spit rhymes sick as salmonella
walking with no umbrella
just spitting my accapella
standing in the rain
rapping to the rain drops and snare kicks
thunder, lightening, when the air hits
sometimes I don’t care shit
try being a starving artist
got food for thought
but nothing to eat
you couldn’t walk a mile in the pair on my feet
size 10 but you ain’t fitting
it’s fitting,
now I’m Universal everybody wants to reach out
what about when I was broke and doing coke?
I was still rapping back then
So ya see me solo standing in the storm
don’t say hello, I’m about to transform
and swarm, like a beehive
might lose the fight, but when the war
and I’m in a war, battle rap
that’s why I don’t battle rap

Intro:
5 G’s Productions

[Block McCloud Speaking]
Yeah, yo J.J. (What up Block?)
This beat is crazy man it’s cold. (Thank you thank you.)
So cold. Block McCloud (Word) Big Lou what up? 
(And it goes like this.)

[Verse One] [Block McCloud]
I’m so cold I’m cool, it’s like a visit to North Pole
And Block McCloud is the wizard of blizzards
If I don’t know ya I’m frigged 
Storm by ya like a breeze
But my swagger my steez will make a shorty freeze
And drop to her knees like she coppin’ a plea
I’m not iced out or coppin’ no V
I’m just poppin’ with these
Metaphors makin’ sense to all of they charm
As soon as I enter the door, temperature change, droppin’ degrees
Like a Masters, a Bachelors, a Doctorate please
I hear myself I’m so sick with the flow, I’ll probably sneeze (Achu)
I’m so catchy, common cold, you wanna party with me
Well if I got it, you got it, now you caught the disease
Not your a Mark Of The Beast, a monster like Reef
That stomps through the east
And wants to be freed to conquor the streets
Uh, at night I’m heat
I’m hot, I’m cold on the morning block
Changin’ the whole games climate like global warmin’
Hey hey

[Chorus]
This world made me what I am
And I am, just adaptin’ to the weather
So run on home and get your coat cause I’m so cold
You better run and find some shelter
I’m so darn cold hearted
To hot to handle, to cold to hold

[Verse Two] [J.J. Brown]
My prose froze like an icebox, colder than white cops
So Wind in the City where they hostin’ the White Sox
I’m chilly like a chick with silly loot at the night spot
A willy cause I’m Cool Hand Luke but my dice hot
Frosty as the Rockies, y’all just photo copies
Warm until exposed, the way Sodom broke the Nazi’s
Go head and get your posse
I hope you know a polar bear 
Cause you gonna need a coat this storm
I hear it’s pretty cold in there
Jeah
I’m freezin’, it’s top season for frost season
Up oxygen to your car freezin’, ya stop breathin’
(Hey Jay when you gon’ quit?)
Homie not even 
I don’t give a shit, come equipped cause the block’s teethin’
Had low temperatures
Brown bounced the predators
Master beat is red as I drown out competitors
Cold as evidence
Ground beneath the sediments
Sounds that crush clowns like mounds of beefin’ elephants
You geeks will never get, a skotch of my shine
?No Gargamel like you was book?, but the flow shit is mine
Look
Cool your heels fam
Don’t touch the pestilence 
Jay got yourself in the clouds bless the medicines
Like hey

[Chorus]

[J.J. Brown Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen. Me and this dude go way back. Celph Titled!

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
I love this sound proof foam inside my mic booth
It makes me feel like I’m in a padded room
Insane asylum sick with a deranged smile
And I’ll electrocute your recruits 
(What’s this man mean?)
I’m awful with
Ether or arsenic in my canteen 
Rappers can’t compete with me
Fuck it I’m a beast on beats
I get mine
I’m grid iron
You eatin’ cleats for Easter treats
You singin’ summer camp songs
I’m Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Janet Jackson’s Rolling Stones cover, hands on
I’m cold
From production to lyrics
I’ll fuck with the spirits
That unleash catastrophic mayhem fire, that sears kids
Call a bitch to fuck cause I need sex
Like motherfuckin’ Terrell Owen’s needs Kleenex
So respect
The ring leader, let’s ring it off
Jehovah’s Witness with a sawed off and I’ll ring your door
(Hannibal in stereo)
Oh, I’ll watch the exercise video and thought an ab crunch was new cereal
Huh?

[Chorus]

CHORUS (x1)
Time is short and my life is sick 
That’s how it is man look at this shit 
You get abused by street platoons 
Hit you like wind and what-cha gonna do? 
We break circles of enemies blocks get shot with defeat 
They say no drive-by’s on the street 
So mutha-fuckas run rival sweeps 
  
Sick platoons flood the streets of Los 
Like a sick typhoon 
Mutha-fuckas drive by world wide 
And everybody you and I know dies 
The only guarantee in life is death your last breath 
Come when your famo least expect it 
Soldier run wild in your song 
Red dawn strikes your back in dead ‘nam 
Your mind’s flipping but the scene’s dead calm 
And your whole world’s thrown and wrapped in psyclone 
Alright ride through the city like that 
Pants, T-shirts are creased and stole gats 
LA undercover shoot to kill 
Child of the streets run wild in war fields 
Scheming on pigs that start shit 
Guilty treat us all dirty filthy 
  
The streets are flooded with budded corrupted minds running 
Those who can’t cut it 
Leave the hoodlum studded ghetto wondering what is 
The excuse or reason for high treason 
In blasting season leaving one of your color bleeding 
Repeating never stopping body dropping 
‘Hood rocking window glocking zone shocking 
Defending pavement attacking, facing arraignment 
Jail’s enslavement shackled for justice to the plaintiff 
When the charges stick that’s it you get hit with some bid 
For what you did prevent and rid some kid of his chance to live 
‘Cause of the block he lives in 
Not giving a fuck just trying to win your block ribbon 
Glock driven joining street platoons like it’s some fashion 
Going out of style so you catch it for some action 
It’s no joke homeboys get smoked, poked, ‘cause they provoke 
Locked on dope no hope for growth that’s why we’re broke 
Short pocket street criminals fail to lock it but crime sky rockets 
So where the fuck is the profit? 
Maybe in hands of those who supply drugs and weapons 
Let’s take that shit back by forming neighborhood connections 
  
CHORUS (x1)

[Tha Joker]
What I’m bout to do, I’m bout to do some sweet shit
If Lil Will heard the rest he’d put me on the remix
I’m taking over nigga, but gotta lotta plans
Central heat and a/c, but still got a lot of fans
You know I’m fresh, been feelin sick lately
Red Monkey’s on my ass, I might have rabies
You know when I’m around, it’s most likely game over
If your a headache, I’m a damn hangover!
I’m way past cold, I’m bout to get my flu on
My flows so hot, niggas want to keep their shoes on
Can’t sell albums if lies is whatcha tellin
Ya best chance of being rich is getting Oprah pregnant
American Pie, we quick to bust it
These guns like beats nigga we got production
At my shows the hoes get satisfaction
But the hotel room is the real main attraction
Front desk at the Hilton xxxxx didn’t understand it
"We don’t want beds, head’s better standing."
Watch these hoes hell they can wear a ski mask
You checkin out her face, I’m checkin out here kneecaps
30 dollar fakes, why was he scheming
Those are not True Religions, your blasphemic
My rhymes like crack, can you feel the numbness?
We eatin good nigga, scrump-deliumptious
Couldn’t get a job if I ever let the fame go
Stereotyped by the way my pants hang low
But I got money, they’ll get you when I say so
If colors get you killed, then I’m a motherfucking rainbow
Headshots will have ya brain like where did all the pain go
Say he don’t dance, chopper bullets make him tango
I’m dropping real soon, it’s gonna be a hot summer
And the streets bout to change, I’m raps Obama
Play with me, ha, I think not
Cause things will get ugly like Ne-Yo’s mughsot
And please send my condolences to Big E
Now I have to skip town cause I just killed the beat!

Yo, you think you’re a warrior?

You know I die for honor. Uh

I’m a warrior man
Leaving bodies on the floor where they stand
Cause Shambhala is the law of the land
Keep my body with Nuabian brands, it’s tattoos
Thinking you can see me is nutty like cash shoes
I’m on another level with money cause cash rules
Everything around me went bloody, I’m mad cool
My female friends are more than fuck buddies, but that too
Classy like Alicia and soulful like Badu
Respect is past due but I’m a take it by force
I’m a warrior, guess I got a passion for wars
Of course I could whip your ass like Bruce Lee did Chuck Norris
But it’s cleaner to be coarse than leave you bleeding from your sores
Got a thing for the .44 caliber dawg
And every 200 yards pimp, my vision is raw
Not religion but the glory is God’s
My persona is fame, inside the love of the all
We call it Honor, I’m a warrior

[Chorus]
I got to ride for Honor [Verse]
You know I die for Honor [Blaze]
[4X]

Behold my leverage
He holds the medicine
Honor, yea, to my soul my heritage
On the block where niggaz hold barettas kid
Hustling, ‘til this rap shit blows like terrorists
A warrior stuck in this old experiment
Box projects and them lonely tenements
Blunt smoke mixed with the coldest beverage
Helps to deal with this life cause its cold as Everest
Went from black power, us holding a leather fist
To white powder exchanged with an open hand
It’s like tug of war, pulling with the rope in hand
Tryna keep behind the line of death, damn I hope I can
My niggaz yelling what’s good when I’m back
And Brooklyn’s wondering what’s good with the rap
So I tell them that I did all I could on this track
And when it rains, no umbrella, I got the hood on my back
Cause I’m a warrior

[Chorus] [4X]

I’m a warrior man
I’m always down to ride for my clan
Cause Shambhala is the law of the land
I’m the Sheppard, we don’t sacrifice lamb, that’s black sheep
Nor do we hit our women cause damnit that’s passed weak
But if bitches think they hard they can get it with tagged feet
It’s a jungle motherfucker, I’m letting the mack speak
I don’t want to leave nobody deceased, but I will
Shit gets hot when you talk about heat, nigga chill
But I still get a thrill from the freaks, what I feel
With their humping like the fire for me, dollar bills
You can find your boy running the streets, Oxon Hill
To Southeast when I’m down in D.C., leave them killed
Think I’m ill many say that I’m sick, I’m profound
Keep it real dawg, I handle my shit, hold it down
With the skills bitches stay on my dick, the pussy pounds
And I still live for Honor it’s part of wearing a crown
I’m a warrior...

{A-A-Arch Tha Boss, let’s go}

[Chorus: Driicky Graham]
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause cash rules 
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause cash rules 
Uh, show off ya hats, show off ya tats
Show off ya arms, legs, chest, show off ya backs
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
N-N-Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause CASH RULES...
 
[Driicky Graham]
Okay now snap backs and tattoos, rap fat I’m that dude
My backpack got cash that, I make a ass clap like tap shoes
I’m in-ter-natio-nal, y’all nig-gaz vaginal
I pass through, fresh to death, you’ve now entered swag school
Ladies holdin kisses, swagger cold as sickness
#TeamDriicky tatted on ‘em, cause they ass is so ridiculous
In the Masi’, paparazzi, man they can’t control the pictures
New, M.O.B. tat, screamin money over bitches
My, clothes and tats they’re all custom though
Something that you ain’t accustom to
Don’t collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats, they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas gettin gravy
witcha bodies marked up, like the train back in the 80s’
I, been through the test, now I’m ink in my chest, tryin to triple my checks
I spend through the rest, buyin a Mitchell & Ness, fly and it fit you the best
From NY to LA, North Cackalack to Baton Rouge
All across the latitude, everybody rockin’ them...

[Chorus]

[Driicky Graham]
In my hood, they wear them snap backs and tattoos 
Clack clack and snatch jewels
Pack tools, crap shoot, and sell crack in glass tubes
Our chicks? Attitude, hard enough to get at a dude
Tatted up, fattest butt, suck it off, VACUUM (Hahaha)
Trips to Miami Ink, after that, Lowrider
When I say, "we ballin" trick, I don’t mean no +Globetrotter+
Driicky is a monster, ain’t a err’ up in here safe
Since I murder raps, I should tat a tear up on my face
Can’t you hear this flow? It’s evil, can’t be near us, close to lethal
Y’all are weird, yo I’m just here to spit 
‘bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Rack some cheer-up for the people, rappers fear cause most are feeble
I don’t have to smoke, I rap the dope considered so illegal, damn~!
To all my Gs’ up, can I just get a witness?
If ya inked up, from the feet up, or you’re stylin, in a Mitch’ Ness
Ain’t leavin out my females, I’m talkin ‘bout dat ass too
Show ‘em all, roll call, let them bitches know we wear them...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
NW, EMG, Top 40
We out

[Intro: Tommy Whispers]
T.M.F., T.M.F., always funky fresh
T.M.F., T.M.F., always funky fresh
Staten Isle...

[Tommy Whispers]
‘85, where biddy-bop is hip-hop
Gucci style flip-flops, Gazelles and flattops
Sharks hit the rap top, guard the crackspots
And the mob, walked up in the joint and flashed glocks
And he said to lose your right hand, to cash shots
Padlock, drug dealers fighting over turf
Used to be one man, supplying all the work
Now young kids got they own, they was tired of getting jerked
You know them days when Germaine, used to run up on the train
Set it off, snuff you in your face, then jet off with your chain
Half-stepping like Kane, heavy on the purple rain
In the cypher with the gods building on a higher plain
You killed ‘em when Slick Rick started spelling out his name
R, Ravishing, the kid was damaging
Any MC who stepped up and challenged them
Pan-handling, snatching purses was the thing
One gold cap, with the four finger rings
Volvo, shelltoes, the Bo’s with the velcro
Block parties, door knockers on the hotties
Getting drunk, off Wild Oxes, Cool and Bacardi

[Trife Diesel]
Watch son move, watching Krush Groove, out with my dudes
Cutting school in back of 49, puffing on Kool’s
Older Gods dropping jewels, niggas tappin’ they brews
With the extra fat laces, tyin’ knots in they shoes
Do it for creases, Playboy easters, it’s newer leases
Back then that’s when hip hop only had a few releases
Bamboo twisting up, reefer’s banging the speakers
Getting busy with an old crew bus, cleaning my sneakers
Hitting my hood was the divas, and she like it, Queen Latifah
Forty deuces off the meter that’s word to my Adidas
Listening to Biz Mark, rock it in the big park
I hate it when my parents said be home before it get dark
Clarks, British Knights, Balley’s, the illest Nike’s
All way cuts from Mo Better, kept a nigga right
Styling with the Casio watches, I was a little Trife
Jotting raps in my scrapbook, it was a little nice
KissFM, tuning in to Red Alert
While reciting a verse, ironing letters on my shirt
That was hip hop, and we here to keep it alive
20 years in the making, 85 to 05

[Fly Guy]
Aiyo, shelltops, leather bombers, sheepskin shit
Cardboard box, breakdancing, and doing backflips
Pissy matress, I respect them old school rappers
Tape deck full of classics, eight tracks, 8 ball jackets
Seude fabrics, Kangol hat, my shit was matching
Pumas with the fat laces, never caught the vapors
Jakes used to chase us, when we tried to steal the papers
Hit the back stairwell, jumping over crack viles
The year, ‘85, where the cables hang down
Peace out to every borough, but home is Staten Isle

[Kryme Life]
We them new school players with old school rules
I learned from the vets, respect my chess moves
Remember kangaroos, and comics from Stetsasonic
Used to be the beef with L and Moe Dee
Graffiti bounded cats got sprayed with crylon
Boxed braids, rocked Gazelle shades, and nylons
Breakdancing was a fad, got bad on boxes
Punks at the tub, rope changes to roxy
Games was called foxy, gangs was called posse
B-Boy stance, cold chillin’ at the swat meets

[Chorus 2X: Tommy Whispers (Fly Guy) {Trife Diesel}


[ Lyric ]
In this hip-hop game rappers are the biggest pretenders
To me the word ‘MC’ doesn’t know no fuckin genders
I enter braincells within the midst of beats
The ray of sound make b-boys jump out of their seats
I defeat all rumors you hear about female MC’s
Let my voice embrace your dome, like lyrics entering your soul
Like old myths that have been told, like commandments written in stone
I’m proned to break sound barriers within microphones
I’m the lyrical body that your mind will always scrape to hold
I am woman, hear me rhyme, our number’s infinite, ahead of our time
Whether it’s hands or arms, it’s all skills, not body parts or hairlines

[ Helixx C. Armageddon ]
After pondering the word ‘reflection’ 
I saw the universal tone frozen in sections
State of aggression while I meditate on human purpose
Life on the surface but I’m woman with a nervous urgence
When splurge this, I’m that ultra-feminine black Latina filled with melanin
Estragen like it was medicine, my thoughts are levellin
They call me Helixx C. Armageddon, stronger than the average
Power 36 to the 10th like Cameron
( ? ) I lost patience with the thought
That the question is my gender’s splendor, anomaly agenda
But as I release the beast, can say my verbal piece
The woman in me, it’s the time to awaken to the East

[ CHORUS: all ]
We came through, now we up in here
Estragen, feel the estragen
We came through, now we up in here
Estragen, feel the estragen

[ Ayana Soyini ]
The woman in me, like Buju B is rulin her own destiny
The woman in me knows what it’s like to be hungry
Hustlin for money when you got to get grungy
Knows the rainy days and the sunny, 360
The woman in me is mind, soul, body
The woman in me has been here for centuries
Infinitely the womb of maternity
Universally free, the woman in me
Is whatever was or will be
The woman in me is d-i-v-i-n-e
Ayana Soyini - the woman in me

[ What? What? ]
Man, let these niggas stay talkin about rippin some tax
We tippin the stacks, my voice’ll cause the skip of your wax
Was flippin these cats since first tracks grippin my back
Fuck my womanhood, brothers kneelin be lickin my raps
What? What? motherland-born, microphone specialist
La Femme Nikita, snipe MC’s with professional hits
My feminine wits is like adrenalinie kicks
When I begin to meddle with shit your head’ll get split
I spit skits that makes niggas wanna rewind and freeze
I’m inclined to rhyme sprees ( ? )
I serve kids with swift kicks from my Servix
Leavin brothers’ lips open and closin they dicks

[ CHORUS ]

[ Pri Da Honey Dark ]
You see just like Mickey D’s I’m seein niggas fiendin for my secret sauce
Cause my rhymes they up and into you like intercourse
Just like intercourse you have venerial diseases
See, these brothers they be leeches 
And they make you causin pre-lyrical ejaculations
You like to brag a lot, I’m vexed
You’re playin your petty games but yet you claim to call it sex
Try to run your game on me, you better think twice
You been eatin too much chickenheads and ( ? ) fried rice
Who I be? Pri Da Honey Dark
And if you steppin up to me you better finish what you start
Without the superficial thought and without the gun
I have the power to knock a thousand niggas back to AB1

[ Yejide The Night Queen ]
Thoroughbred Brooklyn borough-head, mama said
I’m every woman, it’s all in me
Brothers they be callin me Night Queen
I symbolize the moon, educatin my youth
So my power consumes the seeds I push from my womb
Daughter of the water, subdivision of the cell
I live well on the vital idols
That gave birth to my mothers
Others try to claim my mysticism
But they third eye don’t widen with the ism
Or the rhythm like mine, I come a long way runnin
Escapin Babylon and havin on a gun in
One hand, the scriptures
The other hieroglyphic pictures
Of the essence
Feel my estragen
Peace

[ Heroine ]
I flex my double x chromosomes throughout my bones
And the skin to shed my XO-skeleton to spread Heroine
Like ( ? ) be the microphone 
And carry it to Harriet Tubman, a tongue when I style free
From underground to ( ? ) John Blaze
( ? ) silver spoons
My tune sauteein from a sack, crowds react
When they extract my formula
( ? ) horizontal is how it seeps in
I get in under your skin and take over as Mrs. Fix-It
I’m keepin heads bobbin permanent
( ? ) like leavin ( ? ) in windpipes
Spiked with Heroine-inflated steel mics

[ CHORUS ]

[ Apani B-Fly Emcee ]
At the auditory peak with authority
Freely speak by our shadowy physiques in the ( ? ) purple fall
Is it a mirage or 8 genies in one bottle?
The essence of womaness, we finess because we are
Far beyond amateur, not insecure, what we’re here for
Has already be explained but unless they can be us
I trust there’s no way they can ever really understand
Whatever, can’t let those who wait down
Stop the flow of the program
Release my scheme as the anti-virus vaxine
Took infected MC’s before they get a chance to erase me

Oh, Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
You’ve got to surf!
Or diiieee!
We were born in the year of our lord
With nothing on our backs but our funky surf boards
Miles at sea - that’s where you’ll find us
Hundred foot waves, not far behind us
Sharks on my right, sharks on my left
One false move, we knew it was death
Thats when we heard a terrifying cry
"Hug wood, homeboy - you better surf or die!"
Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
You’ve got to surf!
Or die!
Homeboy!
Surf or die!
Surf or die!
We surfed as Magellan; we surfed as Columbus
We surf around the world, and we don’t need a compass
We have no beginning
We have no end
If you’re reincarnated, you’ll surf with us again!
Surf!
Forget the other shit
The other shit’s bunk!
We want the beach town surf
We walk on the beach, in the sand
with our boards in our hand
And If you don’t know by now
Then you’ll never understand!
Surf!
Surf!
R-r-radical!
Surf!
Radical!
Surf or die!
Or die!
Or die!
Now on the beach, Californ-I-A
Where another surfers born every single day
Zuma Jay board, the one I use to surf
We put on our wheels when we’re rollin’ on the dirt
We roll through the streets, we roll through the valleys
We roll through the hills, and we roll through the alleys
Once on water, now on land
If it can be ridden than the funky surfers can!
Surf!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Homeboy!
Or die!
You’ve got to surf!
Or die!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
You’ve got to surf!
Or die!
Or die!
Surf!

Surf or die!

[Intro: Raekwon]
Don’t play, what, what, you heard us
Fuck ya’ll talkin’ bout, what, what, what
We here, we here, shit, Zoe Pound, currency
Wu-Tang, it’s all real, what I’m sayin, peace
Yo, yo, yo, run it through ya’ll

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
Fuck the Dutchin’, while nigga wanna run wit I
We can drop the funk down in M-I to N-Y
Where niggas run shit, sold off mill, we make a profit
Hittin’ the interstate, we all wanna get rich

[Raekwon]
Yo, straight up, break bread wit ‘em
Blow lead wit ‘em, chillin’ while we rap realism
Highlights, gangsta nights, straight suicide fights
We like the shilites, blowin’ off bites
Big nasal, bulletproof hat and googles
We just watch you, we cry off about you

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
If my man spot you, he only spit you and got you
I’m hot, you rock cops out the shoes and stop you
Screamin’ fuck the bloodclot, bust a shot outta two seat drop
I knew it we was bust, and word to logic

[Zoe Pound #2]
The bomb shit, ring the alarm, chairs bent
Like firearm, stays doors bust when the side in
Got in, scratchin’ the tires, insiders
Quick to found, crib, cards and the diamonds
We blind this, ready as the real day now is
See that kid, see that cat makin’ this pill

[Raekwon]
Money is the issue, what come around might hit you
Flowin’ your word, so official
Keep that silent, all real niggas wanna bounce wit it
Bust your gun and be out wit it

[Zoe Pound #3]
So cat that put me up on the lit
Round up all the thug wit a thirty-eight, two K’s and a glock
I was skatin’ he way, wit no diamond west
Me and nigga play the safe, just to build without a trace
Carried out buttons wit big face
Operation Zoe Pound, from downtown to upstate

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Yo, take that back to the cages
Yea, wit the mack to the gauges, jewels and the pages
Skate off, Benzes and lenses
Big wide Range wit a cigar, movin’ like menses

[?Black Jack? - Zoe Pound #4]
Guess who’s back, it’s Black Jack wit a sway crew at
I’m tool soldier from day, they never knew that
Cuz I play the low-low, kick wicked flows
Catch me Mexico, rented though and dilly, yo
I got no white connections for the mangos, call Premo
Bring that dough, I got that real ice flow

[Raekwon]
That’s right, we got eighty in it
All real niggas, throw a baby in it, whips stay tinted
Bulletproof jackets will blaze in a summer night
Rock saude in it, little hate it, in it
Let’s blossom, get up, connect, no gasto
Real ditect real, it’s real when it’s my shoes
Smack that emesole, wanna diss soul principals, blaow, blaow, ghetto lynchable

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
My niggas invincible, Omen is unpredictable
Bust guns for fun, under the sun, it’s a ritual
Third eye visual, forseein’ the critical
Fake mic fiends, ready to smitherins, it’s pitiful
For my niggas did to you, cuz they see the picture, you
Blow your game out the frame, thinkin’ they kissin’ you
Bitch ass niggas, I owe you niggas nothin’, what you got your hands out for

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
Take that back to the cages...
Take that back to the cages...

My man Pos
M.O.P.
First Family
Ya know I’m go
Street shit
Yo!

[Verse 1]
Open your eyes bitch, 
the hardest thing to accomplish is convincing the world I didn’t exist
(HOLY SHIT!!!) Drama, blazing a 4.5 blama raised to uphold my honor
Who don’t respect me?
Death be the b-k black Joe Pesci
Words to 3 ways to dead beat
Niggas got beef, to break some
I convert the whole concrete jungle in a animal kingdom
Shit the way I figure it
You only being called a Ruff Ryder
cause you’ll be all over motherfuckers dick
You motherfucking coward
You ain’t got siss enough to realize the niggas I Browns with
blow holes in your houses
Go ahead and put ya foot in ya mouth
Shit gets down and dirty I starts shitting niggas with hoods in ya house
And I’ma be the last man standing on the block poppin of a mad-ass cannon
bitch we on the planet

[Chorus scratched]
(We comin’ at cha)
(Killing ‘em dead)
(Whatever the cause of this)
(I bring the pain)
(We comin’ at cha)
(Killing ‘em dead)
(Whatever the cause of this)

[Verse 2]
I got a good mind to smack you
Back you down and clap you
For real my skills the steel is factual
I could do drop, duck and roll
But when I hop pop a lot cock buck and blow you got bust into
God damn you
I ain’t got enough money to hire hitmen
So I do my shit manual
I’m a hands-on nigga who don’t mind gettin’ my hands dirty
It’s hard work, but my squad is worthy
And when we get it we gonna keep it
In this game we the best kept secret
And double niggas is the only niggas teph creep with
You know how thugs do
We block the block tryin avoid the avoid the cop
Packin mags with muzzle
And it really ain’t a problem
To let niggas get richer than we rob ‘em
And put ‘em in a obituary column
We real thugs with dangerous minds
And a track record a mile long
Fuck commiting a-hideous crime

[Chorus scratched 2x]

[Verse 3]
See I’m one of them heistmen
In a car poppin mob-deep guns under the carseat
driving without a lisence
Fucking with hoodrats
Niggas send me out of bounds somewhere uptown 
and wonder where the rest of my wolves at?
Whoever I roam with, whether I’m alone shit
Just know I’m Brownsville bound whenever I get home-sick
Whether alone or we creeped together
We keep peeped tucked under the lever
but to hold the streets forever!
See I was hand picked
the drawn steel would lock everything from the saw-mill to fair wind
Motherfucker it’s a raw deal
New York is up for grant y’all I bust ya last nut off
and ya about to get ya power shut off
When the clock strikes 12 
I’m a pop like 12
And the niggas on ya block might tell that they see ya
little nigga running down the street
dumpin the 3 time 3 millimeter
Holler and freeing me out

[Chorus scratched 2x]

(Rodney O)
On the south side, Rodney O was now cruisin
All of a sudden my car stops movin
Could I be outta gas? Hell no
Last night I filled up at Texaco
Popped the hood, smoke started comin up
Looked around and some punks started runnin up
Reached into the car under the drivers seat
Showed the metal and they took off down the street
Then I said to myself I better find a phone
Better yet I better not leave my car alone
You know whats up when they be smokin the rocks
Come back and your car be on crates or blocks
Yo, Rodney O won’t go out like a biscuit
Better call triple A to come fix it
With all that went wrong looks like I lucked up
From down the street drivin up was a toe truck
Flagged him down got the 40 dollar hook up
Hit the car now its time for me to book up
Rollin out then I looked to my left
Saw the punks from before jackin somebody else
Funky stories

Fo’ funky stories
1 down, 3 more to go yo

Playin some ball at the neighborhood jam
Feelin good cause every shot is goin in
I hit the winnin basket and I hollar out GAME
Get off the court and remember my name
But in through the door comes brother Joe Acker
Plays basketball like a middle linebacker
Shoes worn out, socks to his knees
Smellin like Bengay rollin up his sleeves
Yo, who got next he starts askin
Everybody knows brother Joe is good for hackin
Now he’s slappin on my arm when I dribble
I’m gettin mad and I’m frownin up a little
But I try to stay calm and all that 
But next time down the court he jumps all over my back
Yo whats up wit all that? Why don’t you play right?
Cause if you ain’t, we can have a fist fight
He runs down the court like it was nothin
I run up to him cause I ain’t roughin
But he got the ball and made a shot
Everybody’s laughin now I’m callin for the rock
I take brother Joe to the hoop real strong
And this time he got hit the stomach wrong
He lost his air and fell down
I jumped in the air, double pumped and I threw it down
After that I had nothin to say
Cause I knew brother Joe was done for the day

Four funky stories
Two down two more to go

(Rodney O)
In the city one night me and Drew was rollin out
Headin to the store playin music was bowlin out
Got pulled over don’t know why and for what
Cop came to window and I said whassup?
Where ya goin son? Lemme see I.D.
And you’re registration for this S.C.C.
What’s the big deal did I run a red light?
Or do you just gotta mess with someone tonight?
He said don’t get smart I’ll write you up a citation
I said go ahead cause my time you’re wastin
And if ya want, you can search my Benz
So call for backup and invite ya friends
The cop got mad and said I’ll let ya go
I said I know cause ya can’t fade Rodney O
Funky stories

Three down one more to go yo

(General Jeff)
Hadda date with a fly cutie that I just met
She let me on like she was soft and wet
So I wanted to hook up A.S.A.P
And after the date get the goods immediatley
She told me on the phone everything was her treat
She was gonna pick me up and take me out to eat
I gave her the directions to my place
But I took the wad just in case
And it was on meanin too good to be true
Reservation for two with a romantic view
Picked up the menu then I put it down
I didn’t know we was in the hottest place in town
But she smiled and looked at me like it was ok
Thats when I knew I’d be orderin til the next day
We made a toast friends for a long time
Knowin that later on I was gonna get mine
But I played the role real smooth
Actin like I wasn’t even in the mood
And when it came time for the check
The waiter came back and said the card was rejected
No sweat she pulled out another one
So I kicked back cause I was havin fun
Waiter came back same routine
I was on a date with a credit card queen
She left the table and went to the powder room
How come girls can never say bathroom?
But anyway she was gone for 20 minutes
The waiter thought that this was a plan and I was in it
I realized she was gone so I paid the tab
Went outside so I could call me a cab
I never saw the girl but I fell in love again
The cab driver happened to be my ex-girlfriend
Funky stories

Four down no more to go
No more to go

[Intro: Vic Mensa] + (Kanye West)
Oooh, I don’t need y’all either

[Vic Mensa]
Uh-oh uh-oh, she gon’ be mad right? Ain’t that too bad right?

I guess that she just gon’ go buy herself that purse, that purse
I guess that she just gon’ go swipe, buy her self worth, that’s cold
Now I’m the villain, nah really I’m just chillin’
Tryna stack these twenties, fifties, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin’
Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed
And all my women in doubles, I’m at the DoubleTree
All I hear hoes callin’ out wildin’, on the road like every day
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
Blow, don’t sneeze, bitch shut up, don’t breathe {*gasp*}
Gasp, on the gas, ‘til I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed
All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches +fast+
Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then SKRRRR~!
Who her? I forgot her name

There go another lawsuit
In court so much, man I should’ve went to law school
Everybody brawlin’, it was all cool
‘Til I hit the bartender with the barstool
I don’t fuck with fake dudes wearin’ fake Trues
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said "Tru!"
I feel like MJ, I’m in his shoes
I’m talkin’ Montell Jordan, +This Is How We Do+
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
These niggas ass-water, get the Drano
She ain’t really bad, she a photo thot
I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop
That Lexapro got me drowsy than a heart attack
I think they finally think got me where they want me at
I got 700 emails in my inbox
What that mean? I ain’t callin’ nobody back

[Chorus Two: Vic Mensa] + (Kanye West)
Ooh like I don’t, like I don’t know nobody
Ooh like I don’t, like I don’t know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don’t know nobody, like I don’t know nobody

[Vic Mensa]
I be catchin’ too many stares this evening, God fearin’ but God knows I’m on a roll
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store
Ain’t my fault you ain’t the man, made a plan, man it was planned
They sleepin’ on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France
Paparazzi like "Oh that’s him!", pour that gin, let’s get faded
Drinkin’ like it’s no tomorrow, what’s today? I’m in the Matrix
Hater please, let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right
But if she bad, I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
Ooh, y’all pay the price, I pay the difference, it’s just different
SAVEMONEY, ain’t nothin’ different, gunshots and jumpin’ fences
Hold on, I’m tryna get loose, please don’t get shit confused
Ask Don C, I’ve been lit, this ‘Ye shit just lit the fuse
Now I’m on fire, everybody go quiet (shhh)
Like where was you last week, my nigga? The fuck was you hidin’?
Like I was layin’ on my arm, I’m on my side
Southside, I’m down to start a riot ("Southside~!")

[Chorus One]

[Verse 1: MGD]

Cut ‘em down like they short and steady

Y’all niggas on the same thang, I’m on some other shit
Strappin boy your plate is on

[Verse 2: Pappa Charm]
Should the topic be about murder

It don’t stop, get your vest poppin the teflon what your legs put up on
Is it you vision a straight bia holdin the MP
Reload the MGD get your mouth spit on
Represent the south shit and sell PE
Gone leave in a bloody outfit with the bitch, know how to get money
But she crippled, probably don’t go flippin any wrong
Never tickled, she gone all out in the middle???
In the neighborhood probably get my check on
Fuck you if you got your strap on
I take those that I ain’t hoed be the reason why I ain’t got my mack on
Matter of fact on
Niggas in the battledome tryin the outskirts meanwhile you never see em
Jesus love that cream bitch on killin out these bitch niggas for
the one who tell him

I be on some wang weird shit wish me dog

[Hook]
Crush that muthafucking nigga, smack that stankin bitch out
Crush that muthafucking nigga, smack that stankin bitch out
Crush that muthafucking nigga, smack that stankin bitch out
Crush that muthafucking nigga, smack that stankin bitch out

Move muthafucker, get your bitch ass out the way
Move muthafucker, get your bitch ass out the way
Move muthafucker, get your bitch ass out the way

[MGD]

[Pappa Charm]

I’ma flow under somethin well
Bitch you don’t wanna come in
Let’s get something clear, Pappa like it from the rear
Be no creepin off in your ear
Then you can’t manage your flat tire and your ice lodged over in the ditch
And time bitch, not givin fuck in a busta, betta bust quick
Cause pimpin me facin the wealth is strictly ??? done first
Run his ass up on the curb, smoke my herb, that how a nigga get served

[Hook 2x]

Going to hell in a hand basket with a casket of jewels
Fashion and fools? Surpass them with a passionate tool
Matter of fact these raps slap tracks and massacre troops
It’s like cats make tracks and never practice them through
Man, I do this for the head nods and that tap of your shoe
Give me the finish line and I’ll snap it in 2
What’s happening dude is nothing but miraculous groove
That I inhabit, sticking and moving from flax to the loom
Contaminate with gamma rays and make it rapid and smooth
And my biggest critic is the last to approve
And unless I rock shows, there isn’t cash in it duke
I dropped my pen on the floor and it splashed with a boom
The last of the few smashing up a passenger too
Too busy having fun to heed screeds babbling doom
Rose colored glass half full in a lavender room
Tossing a few asides to leave all the fragile consumed
And that’s true

Tactile tic tac toe
Rap and flip lactose
Tackling the tracks dope
Half will win and that’s so
Typical, and that’s the way it has to be
So pass the key\xc2\x85and that’s to me

You dig that? I’m a fan of the same
Remember Raekwons tarantula chain?
I kick raps that ramble and maim, the man is a train
Wreck set to trample parades with mandibles crazed
From analyst ways to stampedes the stamp of approval is gained
Turning it to a brand abandon all of the claims
Living day to day while you’re balling away
You’ll get a stomach ache from eating all of cake
And all that takes is time and moderation like Satchel
Lest the world becomes reason for the Paxil
Closing in walls, all frozen grim maws clenched
Arguing far through it start doing top tens
Giving them a soft serve, nerves misplaced
Tournament interns burn the stakes
Turning away enough to make Saint Peter’s rack and pinion pivot
Imminent beginning to finish spin it all within a minute

Tactile tic tac toe
Rap and flip lactose
Tackling the tracks dope
Half will win and that’s so
Typical, And that’s the way it has to be
So pass the key\xc2\x85and that’s to me

I’m not a candidate for polling holding candlesticks verboten
Hoping glamour is a potent potion, amorous and chosen
Open hands and get a token, never know it just might work
Instead of looking of the product, man I’m check the price first
And rectify verse until the words fit properly
Recording takes with a verb flipped sloppily
One of the benefits of having a studio at home
Is that you can’t hear my mistakes when I roam
Each song’s generation has different tweaks
Varied approaches to visiting beats
if it’s wintertime, then I’m delivering heat
And if it’s dinner, I’m in a different street
So listen to each and make your own call on the song
It is dope, or fresh, or wack, or something soft for your mom
I’m Sankofa, happily hopping along to the drums
The dinosaur rapping with a fossil, his tongue
And that’s one

[Intro: Sean Kingston] (Rick Ross) (*The Game)
Yah mon!!! JR!!! Sean Kingston yuh know (Ross!) (*And the doctor’s advocate)
Beluga Heights! (*Let’s go)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston] (The Game)
Miami have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (Californ-i-a)
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (All the way to Dade County)
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 1: The Game]
Check it! I’m the Bastard Of The Party, shit start off off coke and bacardi
Bandanas tied around the dubs on the Ferarri
I’m the bloods to what Pac was to thugs
What Snoop is to crips I’m the California king
Let it be known, I reign Supreme like Kenneth McGriff
Reincarnated put me in Queens and give me a strip
A couple red tops while the feds watchin
Infiltrate get a head shot Compton is the city of God
My block originators I said blood one on a Dr. Dre track
Now the world is affiliated
Some authentic some niggas Milli Vanilli bangers
Some get smoked others smoke chronic out of philly papers
Game time is really Jacob watches got them silly faces
Add red rubies to the dial they ‘gon really hate us
I inherited gang bangin from my mother
And what I didn’t get from her I picked up watchin colors

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
I’m from a world of different colors different faces
Different slang different races different gangs different places
Air Ones different laces
Different culture different livin different thugs different ages
The sky’s blue the money’s green the weed is purple
The ice is white you try me I’m a have to hurt you
Kingston boy I rep like no other
Black, yellow and green I bleed the Jamaican colors
The grill is cold the wheels is gold the chrome is silver
Nickel plated if it’s blazin than the chrome will kill ya
Certain dudes get one in the head
Certain places you wear certain colors you dead
Fi yuh gang bang yuh diss mi yuh a dead man
Cau gunshot a be like drum pan weh mi come from
And it’s the same old story
We don’t give a damn about your guts and glory

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Miami have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Painted the car blue, that’s for the sweat and blood
In my red tennis shoes fool cause the pain is love
I’m bout my green (Green) So my sky’s blue (Blue)
Purple and the strawberry philly up in my five coupe
Yeah I’m in the yellow boss, they in the white gold
You might fold I’m platinum go ask them white hoes
I got black hoes slammin cadillac do’s
Gettin cheese out a rat trap like I’m that close
Whippin keys in the back that’s how I stack dough
Waitin on that jack boys get him in his afro
These assholes must be gone on that crack smoke
Try to cross the boss well let’s front ‘em what they ask for
Uh! I’m in the thangs, ten tennis chains
That’s how I present it to ya  you think I got ‘em ten a thang
He green as spinach just another lame middle man
Standin in the street wavin my flag in the middle lane

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Hus talking]
Lil Kelis and Lay gotta eat bro
Let’s do it, yeh, yo yo yo it’s nothin’

[HOOK]
Let’s get this motherfuckin’ money
I thank Allah that I’m a sharp man
But I live my life in the dark man
And I swear I see life out the barrel when it spark
I’m obsessed with the guns and the life of a mobsta
I feel I can’t be touched I simply just to much
I’ma never die I thank Allah for my power
I’m crowned as the king of the world every hour
And every breath I take, every step I take
A Tec I take protect my fate, protect my fate

[Verse 1]
When I was younger I developed the hunger that’s how my hustle came
Niggas hated Husalah so I stepped up my murder game
First it was a slug or two for niggas
Now it’s fifty shots rippin’ through ya roof nigga
Do more than chip ya tooth nigga
Vamos nigga you gone in a black Caddy wid a new suit on
I’m dope I flow sick my mind is insane
The hoes they gon’ shook the choppah’s gon’ buck but I
Live in the streets like bums do for the respect
On my block niggas come through and rush duke
Twenty-four seven on my spot niggas gunnin’
The Husalah livin’ his life never respectin’ you suckas
I’ll be a hustler to my death
Every fuckin’ breath that I take every step that I take
It be a Tec that I take not necessarily a Tec
but a chop wid fifty shots that rip through ya chest

[HOOK]

[Verse 2]
Another verse that I never wrote
Lord, I hope this chop don’t smoke tonight and leave a nigga smoked
Twenty-four on my block niggas movin’ coke
Yo my life is changed from niggas movin’ coke
When I was just a young nigga yo my life changed
I switched over from that right lane, to that left lane
Same lane the death lane the last breath lane but I got a Tec man
And I pop pop aim wid it hop blocks came wid it
Cops sweatin’ but we slang but we stay fitted
Hoes jock how we rock but we stay wid it
That’s my hustle mami I’ll never love you
Tilt my scale weighin’ yales makin’ sales wid it
A hundred girlfriends caught up in a whirlwind
Stuck in the game in my backstreet life
My backstreet life, my backsreet life

[BRIDGE]
Good Lord ya shoulda seen him when him cry
Good Lord ya shoulda seen him when him cry
A boat coulda sail inna him eye water
A boat coulda sail inna him eye water

This is the life of a gangsta and hustler
And if you wanna live it then niggas come on and get it
Where there’s no such thing as pain
No such thing as tears no such thing as years, (nigga chyeh)
This is the life of a gangsta and hustler
And if you wanna live it then niggas come on and get it
Where there’s no such thing as pain
No such thing as tears no such thing as years

[HOOK]

[Bias B]
My dad keeps on bugging me to save my cash
You’ll need a house and all that, I should be making stacks
But I’m waiting back, hanging out with mates who rap
Always late paying tax, don’t save a cent, I always raid the stash
I like to splash it on some dinner and wine
Having the time of my life, late nights comfort me, I wind my mind
I find I spend too many hours on end
putting a bend in my brain with substance I shouldn’t recommend
I settle in for a night on the couch
But this Hip Hop life has got me waking up, I should be passing out
Walking past my house, smell the passing about
A free paper, time for play, but let me spark it up now

Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely

Sometimes I wonder why I bother to rap
Travel interstate just to rock on a track
Wake up after the show and I’m coughing up black
I wish my wallet was fat, I’ve got to stop and look back
And all these kids want to chat, always the same old convo
Disable that shit and let me sit and sip my Cointreau
I’ve got no time for this idle conversation
Damn right it’s wasting, trains the same in every state
and I’m hating the scene like Lyrical Commiss’ at times like this
Wanna find a chick to kiss, but some kid’s got some lyrics to spit
I’ve had enough of it, sometimes I can’t be fucked with it
You roll that scoob yet D? Let’s puff on it

Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely

My name is always on the door list so fuck the cost of it
Everything always free with a rhinoceros hanging off of it
On top of this I’ve got to write lyrics that Chopper ripped
I used to send out promos, now I’m shipping out a box of shit
Watch kids stop me on the street, they want their shit signed
Spit rhymes into my ear and let me know how much they dig mine
Gone are the days getting pissed, drinking to get blind
Instead go out for dinner with mates and slowly sip wine
See basically my shit shines on stage when I kick rhymes
Drinking Cointreau cranberry with a twist of lime
The radio cohost who occasionally smokes
Go crack a bottle of Moet with chick’s breast cause I’m so stoked

Shit, 
Shane Capone... the idiotic Bizarre
Spit in your face

[Bizarre]
Shut the fuck up, before your ass get knocked
It’s hard to talk, with a gun in your mouth
Dirty Dozen, nuthin but bad news
Fuck a bitch in the ass with a rubber Hush just used
Fuck the pain, I don’t give a shit
Tie me up and beat my ass cheek with hockey sticks
(uh!  "you’re sick") I don’t give a damn
Smokin crack with Michael Jackson in the ???? ??? program
Blaow, blaow!  You hear this loud sound
Fuckin the engineer’s wife while he’s mixin my songs down
Walkin up in the elementary, lookin like a bum
Watch some kid yell "He’s got a gun!!!"
I’m the shadiest nigga here to come out the Dirty Doz
Do a song with you and tell people how wack your verse was
("Shit’s wack!") I’m laid back like John Forte’
Who got a screw driver so me and my girl can have foreplay?  

[Hook]
We some Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels

Dirtyyyyyy, Filthyyyyyy, Rottennnn, Soundrels
Dirtyyyyyy, Filthyyyyyy, Rottennnn, Soundrels

[Swift]
We walk around this bitch triflin’
Quick to sock a nigga while we cypherin’
Rubber gloves, Black man rifled in my right hands
Watchin rappers dash like hyphens
Burnin y’all without the Tetracycline
I’ma let your set know, I can get drunker than Jethro
Just to run up on you, and crack you with this ????
Smash your vehicle, snatch your key and go
You niggaz think you got somethin to say, let me know
Don’t bite your tongue, fuck it
Rappers switch subjects 
When I’m steppin in they company, them hoes don’t get budgets
Snatchin briefcases with your hundreds
Packin heat just in case you want it (nope)
Bodies in abundance
I have no feelings, tell you the truth - I’m known, bitch
I’m lettin loose any affiliate you run with
So pack your gun quick (nigga), cuz I’ma let you know
You ain’t got a bone to pick with me, bitch I fuck so

[Hush]
Ay yo I’m iller than a white rapper usin the word nigga (WHAT!?)
Got a conflict with my dick like Dirk Diggler
Became sick in the brain since Bugz’s death
Whoever did it, I’m a bust a nose, slugs is left
I’m harder than my dick when I’m watchin my first porn
Ill enough to kill your wife while she’s havin her first born
Leavin the hospital, in a voice just like Beavis
Screamin "I need some!" while I’m holding up a fetus
Spittin the hot shit, nick name is godzilla (ugggh!)
Natural born, undercover cop killa
On the reala, yo, you’re just an enemy
Bout to come up missing like a second John Kennedy
Try to gamble with Swift, muthafucka the bet’s on
Let Shane fuck your bitch while Bizarre jacks off
Hush, I’m crushing rappers while I’m somersaulting backwards
Bustin nuts up in your mattresses, says nobody a better rapper 

[HOOK]

[Shane Capone]
What you motherfuckaz want, red dots when I pull it
Unless your name’s Pac, you ain’t shakin 5 bullets
Anymore, we hustle for cheddar, cheese, and mayo
Quick to hit your city up with more felonies than Jayo
We got murder for hire, all it takes is a call
We leave you slumped over in the suburbs like Biggie Smalls
Venomous lyrics, spittin shit like pipe bombs
Leave your maggot brain, hangin out the frame like Esham
We some Dirty, Filthy
But y’all ain’t feelin this shit
We comin’/cummin’ sicker than a syphilis dick
When we spit, somebody find Puff
Go tell him we got Jennifer hostage
We gon’ rape this little bitch, ain’t none of y’all stoppin
Cuz we raw doggin these bitches and they asshole with age
Hell naw, this ain’t range, but I got pistols on beret
Big Capone up in this bitch like the return of the living dead
And have your white born bloody sheets and a horse up in your bed 
Ain’t no freestyle rapper, but I play for Bugz without no problem
Have you stand around, look and dance, fucked like Dennis Rodman
If you didn’t want this muthafuckin rap game twisted
You should have never let Detroit listed (muthafucka)

[HOOK]

(Some of you are not gonna like me)
(You better know it)
(That’s right)
(Y’all the truth, the whole truth and nothin but the truth?)
(You better know it)
(Some of you are not gonna like me)
(That’s right)

[ Yomo ]
Yo, it’s about time somebody address the situation at hand
We really need to do this, man
We really, REALLY need to do this
Uknowmsayin?

(Time is running out)
(Time is running out)
(Running, running, running... times have run out)

[ VERSE 1: Maulkie ]
Let’s get down to business
I’m from the way back
Where the brothers don’t play that
On the reel we’re equal
Check it
It’s life and death, damn, there’s no sequel
It’s gettin rougher
The Man’s gettin closer
Back up, chump, it ain’t goin like that
I’m fightin blck, cause I’m black, yes, man
God damn, I’m in demand
Where’s my 40 acres and my mule?
I didn’t get it, no sweat, cool 
I went for what I knew, and it had to be good
Rule 4 from the hood
As I stood and showed the flex
The fed and the mob were placin bets
So, put your money on a sure thing
And watch the static that I bring
(Bring the noise!)\t--> Chuck D
Cause in the cell, the pen, is where they wanna store me
Smellin piss, and gettin sick, gee
This is the red, the white, the blue
Your man Uncle Sam and his Uncle Tom crew
Gamin this stuff like they’re playin Monopoly
Sho’ enuff there’s gonna be a catastrophy
Genocide in progress
Keepin brothers in tune mode as I manifest
Finest of the last, can you dig this?
To say what the hell I feel I went Ruthless
Times have changed, hate remains
Since the age of 12 all I felt was pain
By the dawn’s early light
America’s situation is not bright
No matter how much they ignore me
They can’t, cause I can say: burn Old Glory

[ VERSE 2: Yomo ]
All a brother got is his name
Plus the nine he bought
To survive in the asphalt
J-u-n-g-l-e story
Man, burn Old Glory
A mule, 40 acres, and all that
Uncle Sam, step the hell back
So now the USA wants to trip
Cause a brother with a grip
Said ‘eff you’ and some
Kinda feel like holdin out for ransom
Now if I drive a Mack truck through your house
He burn a flag and you’re quiet as a church mouse
Like the sands of time I was surfacin poor
Till this Glory stuff ain’t no more
Some say blacks should ever be so thankful
And stand behind a rectangle
A red, white and blue, blue, white and red
A brother dead, bucked in the head
All because a bitch is America
Yeah, I’m tellin you...
To turn the other cheek is weak
So some speak
And activist activates and finds fate
So eff Mister S-a-m
Cause I know he said eff me
And everybody in the g-
h-e-double t-o l-i-f-e
That’s where my people been left, see
I couldn’t see myself in Iraq
Because that’s wack
For the simple fact that I’m black
So I shouldn’t serve, or better slave, yeah, you know the story
I got the urge to say burn Old Glory

( *as fire crackles in the background* )
(I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all)

[ VERSE 3: Maulkie ]
One nation under a rock
Yo, I’m one brother that the system won’t clock
It’s a game, check the scene
Tell me, what the hell is the American Dream?
Apple pie, baseball and blue skies
A county check, have kids, and then die
But me and Yo will reconstruct
With hi-top Jordans, kickin suckers in the butt
First in line is a mack named Bush
It seems like all my brothers he wanna push
In the Marines, Army and Navy
Eatin potatos and runny-ass gravy
Pimp them brothers like hoes in Iraq
You sold em weapons, now you want your money back
Human lives down the drain
Now tell me: who’s really insane?

[ VERSE 4: Yomo ]
Ignorance and one big rep
History repeats itself, so what the hell I got left?
Freedom of speech, freedom to teach
Freedom abreached
But I can’t cuss when I bust
See, there goes Glory again, stickin her nose where it don’t belong
Messin with my rap song
Censorship and the whole nine
See, they wanna restrain anything against the grain
Glory, glory, glory how I screw ya
And Uncle T-o-m can straight c-o-m-e
With it, or forget it and just quit it
Come correct or get clowned
Cause you ain’t down
With me and my same
See, we the only imigrants forced here in boats and chains
Yeah, there goes the neighborhood
Gee, burn Old Glory
End of story; we out

Burn Old Glory

[ Yomo ]
We are not in a time of disorder
And disorder is now the time

But see they all the same
Girls use panties
Hoes wear strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
Hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
See playas like me, smoke the weed
And get high, so saucily
Playas like Who? Don’t talk playas that do
Who know how to work the draws
Right off you
She had large backseats, pearl white teeth
She told me it was cool if I felt underneath
The car had beat, situation went sour
I’m not gettin’ close, and its almost been an hour
Girls use panties, pretty in pink
She took em’ off and asked what do you think?
Well preferably, I like a string, but when you wear nothin
It’s all the same
I met girls who are sweet and wear mens boxers
But behind closed doors, they flirt with they doctors
She picked up my package, like UPS
Thinkin’ dirty thoughts in a wedding dress
See girls wear panties and hoes use strings
And some use nothin’ to me they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
And some wear nothin, and lie to they family
He wore tight black gloves
He smoked rope in the tub
He was hard to budge when you called a grudge
Picture him in a seat, wrapped in leather
Smokin in the studio, pullin’ it together
Girls still ask, what makes me tick?
What do I like? And who I hang with?
Blunt on my lip, Nikes on my feet
Hittin’ the hash, rappin’ with Reek
Hoes use strings, soft to the touch
And others wear panties that don’t fuck too much
Some wear nothin, like a model on the run way
But gettin’ dug, from Monday to Sunday
Girls get high, tore, and tangy
Get they hand in yo pocket and try to empty your bank
But Lisa, let me hold your visa
I know you got a man, I just wanna tease ya
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings
Girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
21 years young, its just begun
Catch me at the bar, see how the coke hit me with the rum
Some girls are sweet and some girls are silky
Some got perfect ass and others fat and tacky
Some drive slow, some drive crazy
Some get (?) and tell yo lady
What’s up girl? drinkin’ cream soda
In a tight tennis skirt, like Kournikova
She jumped in the pages, of a magazine
I was at Texaco, pumpin gasoline
She had pulled up, slammin’ $horty the pimp
In a all white car, with an all around tint
She stopped me said I like your Calvin Klein
Said you ain’t seen nothin
Till you see me rhyme
I could tell, by the change in expression
 I was about to reap the benefits
Of my Profession
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin but see they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings
Girls use panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they families

[Chorus]
The devil talking to me, but I don’t hear him
The devil talking to me, but I don’t hear him
The devil talking to me, but I don’t hear him
But I don’t hear him, but I don’t hear him

[Verse 1: JustPierre]
The devil talking to me, but I don’t hear him
The devil acting up, but I don’t fear him
I’m walking by faith, not by the appearance
Cuz I know that God is with me, this easy as power steering
The angels in Heaven cheering, we walking after the Spirit
Satan tempting and leering, we greet him with perseverance
Standing firm in the faith cuz the day of the LORD is nearing
And our hands will be lifted up like we volunteering
Yeah we in the building, arise from the ashes
Called to be Saints like the NFL drafting
Chilling in the will of God like we in the Hampton’s
We following the Master, dodging all distractions
Uhh, Fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God’s people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don’t hear him, uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: JustPierre]
I done been around for a minute
All the tricks of the devil, man, I already seen ‘em
The quote unquote new things, that we chasing after
Satan’s giving us the same gift in different wrappers
God or the devil give you anything you ask for
But the blessings of the LORD don’t end in disaster
So I just got one question to ask ya
Who have you made master? Huh? Check it!
Peter told us, ‘Be sober, be vigilant
Because the adversary’s seeking whom his next victim is’
Ever since Genesis, he been on our trail, man
But Jesus still delivers like the mailman
So, fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God’s people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don’t hear him, uhhh

[Chorus: YG]

[Verse 3: JustPierre]
Jesus is number one, tell me who’s the runner up
Coach Christ calling plays, prayer’s how we huddle up
What’s for lunch? Bread of Life? Eatin’ til I’m overstuffed
Sipping Living Water, tell the bartender, ‘order up’
Hol’ up, the battle’s not mine, it’s the LORD’s, bruh
I got the victory, all I gotta do is show up
Whom shall I fear, got the LORD in my corner
The old me is dead, that’s word to the coroner
In the will of God, that’s where you can find me
I’m clothed in His righteousness, I wear it like Armani
Without Him, but aiming for perfection, we’re bound to miss
We have a better chance trying to drown a fish
So, fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God’s people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don’t hear him, uhhh

[Intro: Raekwon (Force MD)]
I like this shit I’m seein’ in the front too
(yo yo yo yo true)
That’s important, know what I mean?
(It’s ‘bout the time man, it’s ‘bout the time yo)
That Afro-American black shit, you know?

[Chorus: Force MD’s]
We’re the mighty Force MD’s, we came to get pai-aid
This is a Hot Request that must be played
We’re gonna bring it back, to where it all began
Straight from the Jungle Nillz of Shaolin

[Raekwon]
What is it? Yeah..
It’s all money on it
Puttin’ CREAM on it

Aiyo Staten Island gun bust, gold and plaque statue on the bus
Spectaculous, us, Wallabees plush, of course
Bring The Force in, melody, melodic four horsemen
Rock, underneath the flostin’
Sport car music from the eighties
Yo it’s all gravy lady
You can hold my hand, when they sing baby
Pedestrians ride, fake niggas move aside
I’m the Don of the game, together we the two 4-5s

[Force MD’s (Raekwon)]
Projects in front of 3:31
We sing in front of our family and friends for fun (light)
Peak our ashtray to the very full (what is it? what is it?)
Nigga I’m just livin’ without bein’ broke
Mr. Magic on the radio, got us a deal when he heard us blow

{*beat cuts off*}
Heard us blow, heard us blow, heard us blow
Let us show you, let us..
How we get this, how we it.. (come on, come on)
Accapella, we did it accapella..
Music (it’s all real, baby, real)
Fantastic, fantastic..
For the people, get that human bein’ vibe
Around people, of hip-hop (live, live)

{*beat comes back in*}
Makin’ heats, out showin’ on the road
We toured around the world and lots of records we sold
Made money like we’ve never seen before (it’s all real in the field)
Houses, clothes and Reebok, valued so much more (what? what?)
Now our fame is really sweet, everybody was playin’ us on the street
On the street, on the street, on the street.. (yeah)
All we achieved, all we achieved..
Still there were life’s treasures deep (make it here, for real)
Treasures deep.. we never could reach
Force was too fresh to keep.. it’s all love

[Raekwon]
Straight up fella show ‘em how we bid
Rather receive that give, throw jewels in a nigga wig, live
Goin’ back, mockneck hats, cordoroys
Bill Blass belts, gazelles, armory days
Slacks, brush ‘em sideways, you liver
Fly ass straddler, recognize Dick
The watch blind ya eyes up
Staten Island click rep on
Violate, get stepped on
These shots’ll blow through your teflon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what? What?

[Force MD’s (Raekwon)]
People say we’re old school, and we say "yeah that’s true"
If it wasn’t for cats like us and Cold Krush
There wouldn’t be no lethal (yeah yeah you know the deal)
No ya know the story, we made it to the to-op
We’re gonna keep it movin’ from the two to the low
And we ain’t gonna sto-op

[Outro: Force MD]
Yo peace out to ??, Dr. Rock rest in peace
Force MD’s, we out

Intro:D-Wiz and Spice 1
"Hey yo Spice, what’s goin’ on man
That sound like 5-0 ove there is that 5-0
    Same mutha fuckas that beat my homie down last week
    But I ain’t trippin’ I got the 187 proof by my side it’s fittin’ ta be on
Is that right, but where you stayin’ at man, what’s goin’ on
    Same mutha fuckin’ neighborhood man
    Just tryin’ ta get this shit off the ground this rap thang, ya know
Yeah I heard that shit, let these niggas know what time it is
    Yeah, check it"

Verse 1
I like to walk around my hood smokin’ dank a lot
I see some brothers in the trees as they slangin’ rocks
Runnin’ through a broken down wooden fence
A nigga didn’t have brains ‘cause he smoked sinse
Or sess or whatever you wanna call it
He got the task on his ass better haul it
Fiends suckin’ up the crack in the backyard
Dropped a pebble on the ground now he’s lookin’ hard
Will he keep searchin’ or will he cease and just forget the hit
Or pull a jack move, and let the nine click
I’m in a cut late night about twelve o’clock
I see some brothas bustin’ caps in a parkin’ lot
There go my homie rollin’ up in a black Vette
Nuthin’ but the money for the paycheck
Another day a brother dead in the alleyway
That’s what the boys in the Bay up in Cali say
The California life, task in the palm trees
Brothers be clockin’ g’s, slangin’ keyes
Up in my neighborhood 
In my neighborhood

Verse 2
Funk, is a part of my life
It’s the sounds of the gangsta Spice
One, check out the blast of a shotgun
Nine mutha fuckin’ milimeter have one
Or two or three or four
Cause every brother in my hood is hardcore
Boom boom to the death of a cop
Pop pop pop, see another one drop
See a crazy ass nigga off the peppermint snappes
And now ya wonder why niggas slangin’ hoppe
Never would’a thought I’d be a deala o’ dope
Niggas slangin’ and bangin’ and breakin’ necks and throats
The spot it was poppin’, but yet the fuzz kept ridin’ my jock
Tick-tock, I watch the clock, they flock
See a undercover cop raise off the block
That’s how it is in the game a slangin’ rocks
Cause on the t.v. they make him look real good
But Mr.Rogers ain’t got shit on my niggas up in neighborhood
In my neighborhood

Verse 3
Welcome to the ghetto, although I call it my neighborhood
Some people get out, but some people stay for good
I see a dope fiend yellin’ he’s a O.G.
He scratch his head and starts starin’ like he knows me
I said what up man I seen your face before
It was my homies pop, shirt dirty, pant’s tore
He had a 40 in his hand left a little swallow
He said young ass nigga and then he threw the bottle
I ducked down and I had to talk real fast
I stepped two feet back and then I ganked his ass
I started kickin’ and stompin’ my niggas brains out
I heard a bitch yell freeze and runnin’ out the house
It was his wife and his bitch started bustin’ at me
I can’t believe this shit this bitch is trigga happy
Pulled out my nine and bust the bitch in the left titty
That’s how it is in a burnt-out dope fiend city
And now your sayin’ I’m the nigga up to no good
I gives a fuck if your bullshit get jacked up in my neighborhood

[RZA]
Aiyo, slipperly slurp slip, nigga, churped off, two sniffs of cocaine
This motherfucker broke the glass in my whip
Try’nna dip, on this twenty dollar bill I had on my dashboard
And police is asking me son, why I whoop his ass for
Save y’all two hours of paperwork, my neighbor lurk
Watchdog, chew ass out, son, and put in major work
We collect antique ammunitions, and plus
We got them big guns, you only see in science fictions
My Uncle Cuffie’s the chief, but my little, knucklehead
Cousin Mar’, yeah, son, is a thief
And we gave him a job, making three hundred a week
But he slipped on my piece, now he’s back in the streets

[Chorus: The Mars Volta]
How many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips
I never heard such nerve before
But you better spill slowly through the cracks of my pores
Just to please you honey, just to please you honey
And how many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips

[A.G.]
A.G. is King like Tutankhamen or Haile Selassie
Body the party, watchin’ for niggaz tryin’ to Pac me
Or Biggie Smalls me, come on, please
With these gemstars, I’m Jason Vorhees
A’s loose, so much pain inflicted, remain addicted
Carry microphones, with the Passion of Je-sus
It’s Flamboyant for life, nigga, throw those L’s up
Ain’t millionaires, by this year, then catch us in 12 months
Now who’s fuckin’ with Andre?
A beast on the east, love on the west, ask Kanye
Still Diggin’ motherfucker, it’s that plain and simple
G.D. til’ my heart beat,discontinue
On the ave., til every soul in the ghetto is gone
Where niggaz sell more rock than heavy metal songs
Anything you want to know, then read E2K
Fuck with A, and get broke up like B2K, cuz..

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Aiyo, aiyo, cuz I’m the piece, the magnetic, I’m not the weak and pathetic
Sometimes, inside my rhymes, you hear words that perfected
Master your Hung Gar, five animal form kung fu
Thundar the Barbarian sword, being swung
Wu-Tang, invincible blade, thrust to parry
Up the Temple steps, much water got carried
In this industrious world, meet the illustrious
Uncombustional, give props like Doctor Huxtable
Knew many men, only trust a few
Women, love the few, mention Wu-Wear linen, rugged blue
God-U’s, I tuck a few, known to smash out a club or two
And represent the worldwide W

[Chorus]

[The Mars Volta]
Oh, oh, your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Feed you the flesh of men, so you can see end again
Yeah, yeah...

[Verse 1]
Hey kid, you know I’d love to stay and catch up
You caught me on a bad day, but
You’ll see me when your eyes are shut
As you’re risin’ up
OK - and what I really mean to stay
One day we’re gonna meet again and it’ll be the same
‘Cause even when I’m gone you hear me in my song say

[Chorus]
Every life, first the sun then the night falls
We’re all on borrowed time, I’ll never say goodbye
Take your time, live your life like it’s last call
Don’t wanna see you cry, we’ll never say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Back when life was easy and innocent
In a simple world ignorant
Stealing cigarettes, going to get high, drinking some Rye
Then again, we’re all the same thing in the end
Butterflies lose their wings and ascend
So do friends - memories resurrect a new life for the dead
So any time that you want to see me
Raise a glass, reminisce - take it easy
Just close your eyes, I’ll be right there with your soul inside
And there’s no goodbyes
I wish I had a hankerchief so I could wipe those eyes
I saw my moms at the funeral, she spoke so nice
Like, "What a great kid, don’t believe those lies"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don’t ever say goodbye, don’t ever say goodbye
Never say goodbye (Ever say goodbye)

[Verse 3]
So kid, don’t mourn, take your life back
Cape Diem and all that
Really matters today is today see
The more you live the happier I’ll be
You’d better take your time and shine
Everybody gotta learn sometime that there’s no goodbyes
‘Cause after every nightfall a new sun will rise

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge]

I have one question for the whole wide world. 
Is, do yaw like scary movies?
It seems to me yaw do.
Freddy and them, I’m jealous of them nigguz man. 
Know what I’m sayin? For real.

Guns cocked, a nigga dropped shot in his head
It don’t stop til his body rocked shot in his leg
Hold him down on the ground
Then we all take turns
And you would think we were squishing on worms
I’m on that dip nigga nip nigga gotta an AK
Watch me hypnotize the earth make em do what I say
And make the good people rich
And the others don’t bother
Make the evil start killin up there mothers and fathers
And fuck America, now the psych is steppin on toes
Bill Clinton got at least twenty-seven more hoes (yaw don’t believe me)
Short ?? take a life, an eye for a brain
While cats in the mortuary seem untamed
Kinda scary, Sleepin by them graveyard bones
Its just the way they just sit in the tombstone
Crooked cops the brutality would stop
If we all came to gather and just did like Pac, and bust

Do you like scary movies (yes) 4X

And I’m the psychopath ready for war
And I’ma let the nigga go if his keys in the car
Everyday mind state I call it psych mentality
Set it straight, Norman Bates is the psycho reality
Casualty, nigga thirsty for blood
Two pit bulls locked up, one just bled like a flood
Break ‘em up let ‘em go again give him respect
I saw ‘em LOCKED in the same spot twitching his neck
My bad attitude I’m not in the mood
Searchin, for a body so the birds can have food
nigga, drag him down the street
Til his ass says please
Concrete hurtin when its scraped to the knees
Do You Like Scary Movies
I’m switchin to psycho
The darkside... Freddy, Jason, Michael, and chuckie
Candy man, Leather Face young g
These killas will never die cause they live throw me (nigga)

Hook 4X

I see brains hangin, it went throw a phase
Some of yaw take notes
while some of yaw graze
The rest of yaw muthafuckas just form one line
Psycho club showin love and you can have some of mine
Don’t try to play me at my show or think I’ma ho
Don’t make reenact movies at my muthfuckin show
And start bustin like a psychopath, reloadin clips
Newspaper read 22 slaughtered by NIP
The psycho in side of me conceals itself
But the moment that there’s drama it reveals itself
A new man understand with a whole new plan
D-E-A-T-H my man
The sound of a body part popped like a pistol
And most chain saws cut straight to the gristle
Keep dancin, movin, the beat sounds groovy
Don’t trip muthfucka you done seem a horror movie

Hook 4X

Hell yea
Hell yea we love ‘em 4X

[Murs]
I wanted her to grow up to be my soccer mom
The white girl that I shoulda took to prom

Her blond hair was just like sun rays
She took me far from the block with the gunplay

On Sunday, she would make me vegan food
And lots of other shit I’d probably never be into

When we travelled, I would be the only black person
Except the gay best friend, he was half-Persian

[Chrous]
And she truly was the apple of my eye
Never wanted her to ever leave my side
Miss America, American as apple pie
My first white girl, her first black guy
Pure love sent from the Most High
Racist bullshit came from both sides
My homies used to say she wasn’t that fly
My first white girl, her first black guy

[Murs]
We used to go to fancy dinner with the folks
It would feel like the episode of Diff’rent Strokes

She smelled like a dog when her hair was wet
She said my hair felt like a Chia pet

She couldn’t take much direct sunlight
Sunburn, no sex, not a fun night

Newsflash: white girls have ass too
And for some of you sistas, that’s bad news

[Chorus]

[Murs]
I would yell and she’d never say a word back
She used the word "cock", I never heard that

We would get drunk off a ton of liquors
I say, "You white bitch!" and she cum quicker

She told me, don’t believe the white lies
My dick was no bigger than the white guys

She look like Topenga from Boy Meets World
Her first black guy, my first white girl

[Chorus]

[Wattstax Intro]
Ladies and gentleman . . . right about now
You’ll see a side of life, that you’ve never seen before

Yo yo yo yo yo
Unh Unh

[CHORUS]
It’s the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest Destiny
It’s the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
It go M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest Destiny
It’s the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T
It go M.anifest M.anifest M.anifest
It’s the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T

[INTRO]
Let it breathe for a second
You know, Music always needing illumination for every soul today
That’s what M.anifest stand for
Four Shades is the movement
Representing live from Ghana, West Africa
You now rockin’ with the best
if you ain’t got the name right
It’s the M-DOT-A-N-I-F-E-S-T

[VERSE]
Yo, check, Yo 
Simpletons don’t check for the rhyme they dig the rhythm 
I swagga raps on these tracks embed wisdom 
My mission, seduce with a smooth composition
Bait them with my hooks like Yeah dog I’m fishin
Ain’t with all the dissin But I can and will chalk 
These lines to bodybag all competition 
They say I’m sick Ain’t no remedy or medicine 
On the mic I spark the light like I’m Edison
Tell me who’s better than this Soon to be veteran
Host of the late night some might call Letterman
Mama raised a gentleman but the beast within 
Unleashed is Ludacris I’m disturbin’ tha peace
What’s the meaning of beef? 
I wanna make dough without the yeast 
Expose misdeeds my Pelican Brief
Black child origin Accra 
Represent Africa with a spectacular street vernacular
Proverbs in particular my main vehicular to the listener 
Backdrop, a beat that’s sinister 
A must when I bust yo, I gotta be lyrical
4Shades is the movement we keepin’ it spiritual

[chorus]
Are we addicted to the struggle or committed to success?
Are we focused on the positive or holdin’ onto stress?
Not sayin’ thing’s perfect but in many ways I’m blessed
Learnin’ how to take the negative and flip for the best
Everyday bring challenge, every challenge is a chance to advance
The power is right in our own hands
From a youth full of rage, to a wise grown man
Here I am, life is beautiful now, I overstand

[verse I]
I’m lookin’ forward through my rearview mirror in hindsight
Gotta be more than just a G if you keepin’ your mind right
Better be ready for the battle or focused on my fight
I ain’t sittin’ on no sidelines watchin’ them highlights
I’m gonna begin the game playin’ to win but learnin’ from setbacks
And my strengths and weaknesses and masterin’ what I’m best at
Power of refinement until you get right, exact
It’s all in your mind, but that’s dependin’ where your head’s at
Life is a chess match and lessons come from your mistakes
Try not to end up in checkmate no matter whatever it takes
Long as you’re breathin then you can be problem solvin’
Stayin’ involved, evolved, world keeps revolvin’
For the cause be all you can from the mornin’ to the sunset
You never have no regrets
Took the journey to the edge of your fate and then lept
Not just understandin’ but overstandin’ is the objective

{keep it open, in perspective}

[refrain]
Just let me be what I am
Take my destiny in my hands
By my actions you can judge where I stand
And I hope one day you’ll overstand

[verse II]
Change come from the inside out
No fear, live free, let the truth ride out
I’m steady, shakin’ off the shackles of the old me
Wakin’ up daily, meditation, feelin’ so free
They hate to see you change {yeah}
But they don’t understand {no}
The less you see for yourself, you won’t comprehend
The caterpillar don’t care what you think about him
He was born to be fly, his nature gonna bring it outta him
By the struggle I was never broken, I was broken open
I tapped into a source that was omnipotent
Had to shift my focus to my higher purpose
ain’t nothing weak about broke, it takes a fighter’s courage
People say they want a revolution
But steady holdin’ on the slave ideas, afraid of evolution
In life we live and learn, it’s pratice, theory, practice
Wisdom is organically grown, its not pre-packaged

{it’s forward baby, never backwards}

[refrain x1]

[verse III]
We think we found the absolute truth
But only to discouver it’s a labyrinth, we go from on maze to another
So many chambers and angles, peelin’ the onion layers
Within it all I see the same gang, just different players
So I rebel from the prison cell of the pidgeon hole
And dare to be myself, original
A man lives on principles --I don’t posture to be popluar
Born to be a leader not just a blind follower

[verse IV]
It’s family before the dollar, your priorities in order
And like Bruce Lee say: "Be the water, be the earth, be the wind and the fire."
Elevate, take it higher
It’s instinct, fulfill your needs and your desires
But we go to be compassionate, considerate, a people’s advocate
Eradicatin’ ignorance through experience
The more you live, the more you learn and you grow
It has a positive effect on all the people you know

{it’s motivation}

[refrain]

[chorus]

I hope that you will overstand [x2]

{look at things without any opinion
otherwise you’ll never look at reality
look at things without any philosophy, without any prejudice, without any dogma, creed or scripture
just look, without arrogance
and see the cause of ignorance, it overstands}

{Change is neccessary to evolution
The universe contains incredible diversity
And you cannot experience it all within the confines of one comfortable lifestyle
Look ahead to what you will think of your life at it’s end
You will probably not want to look back and say it was cozy and dull
Thus, react positively to what seems to be disaster
Remember that what seems how to be disaster may be an important step toward evolution
And may even be identifiable as such at some point in the future
Every great loss takes you out of a rut and starts life anew
Be grateful for the time you had and your former happy state
And look forward eagerly to the new phase
Information age.}

[Intro]
Kiss your eyelids and awaken now, one two go

[Verse One: Eligh]
When I crack open my eyelids in the morning
First thin on the mind is my carnage
I ran through in a dream state is an island
I need coffee to get off it
Hockin up phlegm, spit it off my balcony
With a cigarette pursed between two fingers in a right hand
Alchemy edging me revisit in subconscious minutes
Spittin intense incidents accidents and coincidence mental blockades
Opened up for thought traffic to flow freely like the autobahn
Phenomenon mano y mano cuss like verses
The present is just potholes in my lawn
Beyond the B-rated porno flick, this man here is sick
And if you could see my dreams first hand you’d think I was a lunatic
The thing is this, when I was an active addict
I preferred the dream world but now that I’m clean I like the real world
Steel pearls drop like rain, the gift of pain I learned to love it
I yearned the covets of love and put nothin above it
Tough luck for a man who got a brain who tells him to get shit daily
So I go through nightly melees in my mind like Israelis
with AK’s pointed out the windows of Mercedes
Am I crazy? Undercurrent runnin through stargates
It’s my fate to awaken tired soaked in perspiration
but my sweat smells delightful
The light I blast out the lighthouse I live in is light years ahead so trip

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Trippin into this I say I feel like life is fake
It’s all these dreams I’ve fallen into, life is better not awake, I’m

[Verse Two: Reverie]
Please tell me is this real?
Am I sleeping, dreaming? So intriguing
When I step into the clouds, high off writing, igniting sounds
I clown on cowards quick to devour, power
Anythin that can be used for reimagining our, world
in another state of mind may they shine
All the stars in the sky give the ideas in my mind
I’m inclined to daydream, teachers awake me
Mistake me, but the people that are concentrating
Only if they knew what I envisioned
Spaceships up in planets on an astronautic mission
Not restrictin the creativity, flowin deep within to me
Enemies cannot enter this realm of livity
They are sentenced elsewhere, open minds here are vital
So listen to the riddles I recite in my recitals

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse 1]
She call my phone 3 in the morn said that she was

(sing songy Chorus intro)
It’s the mystery of Inequity...
Said it’s the misery of Inequity...
Said it’s the history of Inequity...
When it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down

Children...
Eat your bread
Little children...
Eat your bread
Cause it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down

(First and only verse)
Yo!
Y’all can’t handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors, witness despised
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
Its entertainment...the arraignments
The subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon
Black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the surface on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator
Receiving the judge’s favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff
Representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution
Political prostitution
The more money you pay.. the further away solution
Legal actors
Babylon’s benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants
Morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn’t making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em’
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he’s being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers
Dodging duty for years
Hating the process 
waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct?
Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt
Spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause
Prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind
Guilty never defined
Filthy as swine
A generation purin it’s own mind
Legal extortion
Blown out of proportion
In vein deceit
The truth is obsolete
Only two positions:
Victimizer or Victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece of the "American Corona"
The Revolving Door
Insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing
What are we working for?
Empty traditions
Reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief
Brethren can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men
Trusted in the chariots dem’
Leaning on horses
They run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them out really white
Internally they absent of light
trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
Evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first
Angelic being cast to the earth
It’s time for rebirth
Burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed
Let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it’s real
Surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap
Causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come
Find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
Self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
Hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
Let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You’ll find what you sought...was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught
Where the majority remains caught

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

(sing songy Chorus Outro)
It’s the mystery of Inequity
Say it’s the history of Inequity
Say it’s the misery of Inequity
When it all...
All falls down
I’m telling you all...
It all falls down

Niggas gonna ride high to die
And I’m ‘gon stay ridin’ high
Ride high to die
This for the fo sho’s
You know what I meant
This is for the niggas and we ride fo sho
For the niggas gettin’ scrilla on they grind fo sho
For my niggas locked down doin time fo sho
(for my ni.. for my he..), ugh

(Lil Ric)
Straight from the block with a glock
Is the best of things
Been servin’ caine on the corner
For the scrilla sippin’ on a
Millers, fuckin’ with killas
Smokin’ bomb
And twomp sacks, fuck this brew
We meet and straight yack a fifth of that please
Straight to the trees
Mobbin’ villan life, livin’ that wicked rich life
Nuttin’ nice off the heazy
You will not want to see thee
Gorilla motherfuckers puttin’ a mash straight down
That ass seein’ all fucked up and bucked down
Got scrilla downtown, bet I got a swoop
Then fuck the bitch on a fuke in my niggas coup
Whoomp there it is, case gets dismissed
Back on the streets with glock and block zibs
Shits more funky than a weak dead donkey
Man it’s on in the ghetto
Everybody got metal
Lookin’ for strips daylight
Through midnight this shit might
Go down on sight
Now I’m gettin’ through the city of life
4 deep in a rented Jeep Cherokee
I see my G from the block and
He taking flockin’ a reno
But come up on some quick c-notes (c-notes)
They got a kite for my nigga big track
Him and Spice doin’ 23 and ones of FED max
Bought an AP strap to donate to the hood
That’s ready to clock a (?) track
With the whole click if it’s good
Now I’m rollin’ through the southside
Smokin’ vegas gettin’ high
Deep on the scene with the gangsta lean
Triple beam sceems workin’
Niggas from every turf spendin’ bread with this loot
Knuckle heads see the feds got they 
Eyes watchin’, this niggas in his 50 knockin’
I hit back and ugh, early mornin’ make me shoppin’
See Lou with it with Eightball
On the mission for scrilla gettin’ bigga
And we ‘gon straight ball
Since the hall where them wild juveniles played
Been witness in murders from the buck shot
To the ten gadge spray
We ‘gon ride, ugh
And ya

Chorus x3
This is for the niggas who we ride fo sho
For the niggas gettin’ scrilla on they grind fo sho
For my niggas locked down doin’ time fo sho
And for the bitches who be lovin’ us ‘doe

See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
See me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
And man, a few of my niggas doin time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin’ us ‘doe
See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
May me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
May some of my niggas doin’ time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin’ us ‘doe
We ‘gon ride
Yeah what’s up 4-tay
And I’m ‘gon stay ridin’ high
Don’t ride, ha ha, yeah

[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]
As lightning strikes and thunder pounds
Over the grey skies of East London town
Prophecy K returns from the underground
Signified by the peoples crying, trumpet sounds
Yeah the system it tried to shut me down
But I been on my ting before Onyx was flinging guns around
Blood, sweat, and tears for years
It feels like my careers been in the dumping ground
Yeah this is how hunger sounds

And I’m the hunter now, ‘Lash the lion-heart
A.k.a. the man behind the iron mask
For ten years straight I been raising the iron bar
Tryna’ breathe the life back into this dying art
So why try and part, when you’ll meet the same fate as that lion Scar
This game’s fake, full of two-faced, lie in grass
Who will sell their soul and ass just to climb the charts
Yeah, but me I put in too much time in the graft
Refining my craft for labels to sign me for a minor advance
Picture K’lash miming on Trance
Now picture Dr. Dre beats/’lash, rhyming with stars
It’s all fate and I got mine in my grasp
Their all snakes, let them die in the past
But who knows what the future holds
These N.W.O. soldiers will probably shoot me cold
All because the truth was told
You should know I did it from the heart

[Chorus: x2]
I’m still here, pushing after several years
I’m still here, standing strong, never in fear

I’ll be still here after the dust settles and clears
I’ll be still here after the blood, sweat and the tears

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
I don’t do this for the happy ravers, or the aggie haters, [?]
I do this for the warriors and the gladiators
I do this for those whose lives you never cared about
Can’t pronounce their names, their origins, or their whereabouts
Those brought up around tragedy and sadness
Who adjusted and found normality in the madness
Fight the power, till I’m out of breathe like Malcolm X
You empower the powerful, I empower the powerless
They’ll play you on the radio if you rap about a Gucci belt
But rap about the government, you might aswell shoot yourself
Industry fairies, say I rap about conspiracy theories
Just to hide the fact they lyrically fear me
Got the eye of a tiger, the heart of a lion
The mind of a lifer, my stance is defiant
I rise like a phoenix immediate from the ashes
My existence is inconvenient for the masses
Though we are equal I despise an imitation
I live for my people, and die for liberation
I stand as a visionary; someone got plans of killing me
To literally vanish me physically like Aborigines
Hannibal with the mask, and an animal with the bars
I’m grappling with my shackles; I channel it through my art
Feel it in the ambience; Champion: Heavyweight
My life is nothing but my pride is something you could never take
Think I’m illusive?, or think I’m a nuisance?
I swear these major labels must think that I’m stupid
Keep your 360’s your convincing these dudes with
Like I’ll give you the blueprint for pimping my music..

I say that like K’Lash, he’s another lion
Every hardship from getting scarred to my brother dying
Spit all of it with or without a big audience
Through the Blood, Sweat & Tears I stand victorious!

[Chorus: x2]
I’m still here, pushing after several years
I’m still here, standing strong, never in fear

I’ll be still here after the dust settles and clears
I’ll be still here after the blood, sweat and the tears

[Intro: Rah Digga]
Whoo, Yes
Ladies and gentlemen, (D-I)
Yall know my name, (Dirty Harriet)
Digga Digga, (How serious)
I’d like (D-I) to shout out my manager Ace Lentz, (This album is)
Let’s do this, Megahertz, (2000, D-I)
Flipmode Squad, Busta Rhymes
Outsidaz reppin the bricks
Nobody on the track. (D-I)

[Rah Digga]
Yo, When I step in the booth, Flip ugly and I loose all couth

Dig-ga we straight
Got somethin for you and you and you, Man what’s my name yo, (D-I) G-G-A
As we start round two, Next rhyme might be about you
Hope you never see the light, Like Juwanna Man 2
I’m still makin sure, All my rhymes is tight
Tell you that from day one like they tell us God is white
Imperial chick from Brick City, Doin a buck fifty
Rollin around in trucks strictly
When it’s time to break fools, My rhyme styles dagger
Tare you down worse then the O’Riley factor
Do it for my sake, I dare yall to try me
Burn yall up the ass like cancer in the prostate
Best in the tri-state, Perhaps in the country
Headline with no album, That’s how bad niggas want me
Might be a little raw, For the average broad
Don’t worry baby girl, I got somethin for yall as well
Do tell, Cause everything’s a story
It’s your favorite little grimey, But my name aint NORE

[Ghostface Killah]
It wasn’t the way she rapped, It was a talent
God gave it a she brought it back
Tell Bust I said peace
Flipmode flip dough, Zip codes, Go back home on skid row
Niggas don’t like Tone
Or you digga, Handle they bitch and I’ll get the nigga
Develop that into a real picture, Click
Niggas get that shit, I don’t play that shit
I concentrate on hits, Not that BET
Nigga bodies or an ill album, Or a song for them ill mommies
I swear I will dot theses niggas the fuck out
Get to cussin and cuttin, These corny cocksuckers better stop frontin
Word, Blow yall niggas for damn near nothin
We-Got, Yo let them things pop, We got the mean darts
Cheese-Blocks, We the welfare babies with the dark brown birth marks
Don’t get your assed up, Fuck that
Ghost and Rah Digga, Taxin niggas, We aint cuttin back so
Please-Stop, Theodore and Flipmode will invade your whole spot

[Bone Crusher talking]

REPEAT CHORUS w/ ad libs by T.I.

King of the club, I bet you cain’t top (top)
Bitch niggaz hate the fact I get gwap (gwap)
or the fact when the money go up, it won\xc2\x92t stop (Come up!)
I’m in the club, tryna show ‘em how to stunt (stunt)
Tryna pick up what I throw, it prol’ly take ‘em ‘bout a month (month)
The club underwater, have ‘em runnin out the front
While I’m somewhere in the back, gettin blowed like a blunt (blunt)
No need to trip, you can tell ‘em that I’m cool as hell (cool as hell)
‘Cause if it’s the case, I’m known to the pack the tool as well (tool as well)
{?} broke motherfucker, nothing new to tell (new to tell)
Got both underneath the old school as well (school as well)
I got lights on my wrist that’ll flash like cop (cop)
Couple of foreign cars that I ride no top (top)
Couple of whi-whips that I ride like yachts (yachts)
A couple of haters lookin, I’m knowin them niggaz hot (hot)
You can tell ‘em that I don’t give a damn
Hard As a Motherfucker, tell ‘em I was H.A.M.
Call it what you want, I’ma do it for the fam
Yeah, that’s the type of nigga that I am

[Ace Hood]
Okay, I’m back off into this bitch (bitch!)
Wit a cup, and it’s full of that liq’ (Hot!)
Got racks, ain’t talkin tits (Feel dat!)
Big stacks, no Lego bricks (Whoo!)
Hit a trick and if any nigga got it
I keep that hottie, just look at her body
Blew twenty bands in that King of Diamonds
Sorry, that’s just part of my hobby (Swoop!)
And I hear ‘em feelin my Florida swagger
So dope, shoulda sold y’all copies
That ice be onto my neck and wrist
Now anybody wanna play some hockey?! (HAAH!)
I’m that nigga in fact (in fact) 
Paper tall as Shaq (Oh boy!)
"Blood Sweat and Tears", it’ll be on your local Walmart rack - soon!

[Chorus]

[Akir]
Yo, uhh
Where was FEMA? What do they gain from Katrina?
And why it take so long to save us but so fast to clean up?
Who’s in charge of them green bucks?
Cause they supposed to give survivors least two G’s plus
I need much in answers; was it because, they live below standards
and drugs ran rapid that it’s quiet up in the cabinet?
Who was on call, did they really drop the bomb?
Did they say {fuck} it? We’re reminded ‘bout them damn walls
Can we call ‘em levies? Did the water get heavy and overrun the town
or did people come knock ‘em down?
Are they tryna help ‘em out or tryna kick ‘em out?
When you see them come around to evacuate a house
Who has insurance in one of the country’s most poorest, communities?
Isn’t this country for you and me?
Separatin families, destroyin unity, conquer through divide
Are they gonna help us survive?
Or is it genocide, do they wanna help and all revive?
Or will it be, gentrified? Watch the choppers in the skies
No supplies, devils in disguise, spinnin stories on my people’s lives
Standin by while they just lettin us die (die)

[Immortal Technique]
I feel like the whole world gone crazy
The stadium smells like {fuckin} dead babies
And old people, goin through rigamortis
While the government tortoise, slow to support us
Instead they record us and give us self-righteous orders
Reporters implore us, not to break the law
I saw a {bitch} talkin on TV, I wanna break her jaw
A teleprompter, can never describe what I saw
The phones are dead, no police and no E.M.T.
Powerless like we got hit, with an E.M.P.
It reminds me of the days when we lived as slaves
They just denied the migrant workers, federal aide
And people tell me poverty, doesn’t have any color
Well it does down here mother-{fucker}
And now they talk about, rebuildin where nothin is workin (nothin!)
Just lawyers gettin more contracts by Halliburton

[Poison Pen]
We restored the fresh corner on some Mardi Gras {shit}
Swervin down Bourbon - on some party town {shit}
Drinkin {fuckin} liquor, I’m speakin real candid
Who knew, N.O. would turn president land this
dude got us lookin savage - like newer reports
Get the rich ones out the tellies, and ignored the warts
Scores of people perched on top roofs
96 hours with no damn rule, but who the {fuck} wouldn’t shoot?
"So would I" says the cat
Brother stranded, wife and seed on his side, {gat} on the lap
Now anarchy, rule the street
Mayor cuss the government out, on the TV all you hear is bleeps
Despair dro, some the same
Super dope synonymous with pain, ironically they change quotes the same
I know firsthand I got blood (yeah) you heard from me
Second line been should be playin for eternity

[Mojo]
Walk with imagination, prepare for the devastation
of these poor people bein displaced in our own nation
No food or water with four days waitin
Fearlessly they’re flyin over to assess the situation
Dirt they doin to my folks blatant
Satan they causes, breakin they clauses, lyin to our faces
Take a step back, let’s retrace this
Cats were breakin into stores cause they were runnin out of patience
Most of them gunshots you heard about, yeah
They were pointed in the air cause the bullets were flares
But regardless if the media cares or not
We should still share a lot of truth, keep stirrin the pot
into a spicy gumbo, dig deep, let your funds go
Never know a storm might hit Flatbush or Ludlow
Who do you think they’ll save, them or us?
Mother Nature doesn’t choose sides, cash flow does (that’s right)

{*music and sirens fade out*}

Dialogue

(Equipto)
Maybe you can catch my next show
Whether its East or West coast
I show love all through the bay
Frisco, the O, San Jose
In LA, we off to the Beverly
Hennessy on ice, at the Embassy, Suites
San Lu’, Santa Barbara, all in, San Diego with the Chargers
We goin farther, touchin down
Homies run rappin, rush around
We hit Denmark, Copenhagen
Couldn’t wait to get back to the golden gate
To, Santa Cruz to rock at the Catalyst
To Princeland, off in Minneapolis
All through Oregon, parkin lot pimpin
Left Portland like Scottie Pippen

(San Quinn)
Said I slide out of Frisco to Kansas City
Missouri and Kansas the girls is scandalous
Shit is hot in Little Rock, Arkansas
I said the all get in, and the shit they talk
Then its down to Texas, Houston and Dallas
Where my blunts they roll the fattest
Hate the Cowboys, despise the Rockets
Like the country girls, cats smokin dope out they pockets
Hit New York like a Giant, the swings are back
No trust, no sleep, gotta bring my gat
Lookin for the king of rap, so I can take the crown
Then I slide to the next town

(Equipto)
It was hot on the beach in Florida
On the streets got a peach in Georgia
Across to Boston,  then hit the Big Apple
Shop Bellview, was +Sleepless in Seattle+
In Vegas cracked and got lucky

(San Quinn)
Lookin for more dough, someone come try me
At the Pro Bowl, I’m out in Hawaii
(?) girls, I’m up on them girls
Tryin to put thangs in, take thong off girls
I can get a show with Louis in Idaho
Puff some real dro’ before I go back to Spokane
And catch my plane to Chicago
They searchin, dogs sniffin through my cargo
Never move illegally, from there to Tennessee
Rollin up a Titan, sippin on some hennessey
It goes down, mo’ brown in Cleveland
Ass round titties big gimme head this evenin

(Equipto)
From Yamagata to Yokohama
Suckas sound like Mary sayin no more drama
Indoja aroma its California
With females frontin off in Arizona
Its me and Quincy, off in Cincy
On a red eye flight and we high and tipsy
Mississippi and Carolina
From New Zealand all up through China
We land in London, its all on a fluke for real
And we chill in Brazil like Snoop
Proceed with caution, back to back shows in Austin
A wild response in Wisconsin
In Colorado where the groupies sweat us
Or the land down under with Gucci sweaters
In Delaware, I couldn’t really care
I’ma set up my shop, from here to there

(San Quinn)

Savin more souls, cause thats our mission
Watch us do it to be the hardest in town still we undisputed
A demon killa is what I be, a rider for G O D
Christcyde on mine, and only God can judge me
That’s why I ride wit a mean mug
Forget indimidation, grab our guns let’s get em up
I know ya’ll sayin is these brothers really Gospel
But we wrestle not against the flesh and blood, the spiritual

And cant see how 5 mortals
Can cause such choas to my kingdom

Changes lives of others

[Chorus]

[Demon speakin]

From drive by’s to gangs to drugs and alcohol
I even killed some of their homies
And put some in jail
Yet they wont break
Who are they?

[God speaking]
They’re adopted by me
I AM THAT I AM

She walk like she got headphones, rockin’ Aretha
Lady of light, the type that you’d like to speak ta’
Hard to reach, sorta speaks like a drink of water
Far from a leaf though it’s hard being the king’s daughter
Not really into order but her expectations call for a man to be strong
Plus patience, see, you can admire the flower
But understand, you dealing with a woman and a higher power
And my father in Heaven must’ve gave her the Earth
‘Cause the money don’t impress her, yo she know what she’s worth
And she knows rebirth, and she can feel it
Went through too much hurt to conceal it
It’s not what she say, it’s the way she reveals it
And how the world wanna steal it
That spirit in which her body’s a home to
Sorry world, she’s outgrown you

(Chorus)
Outta the gates to the wild blue
Sky’s too great, she gotta escape, fly through
With a smile to kinda remind you
You gotta look ahead and not behind you
She said staring at the sun won’t blind you
It’s just a lie used by the world to confine you
But I know a place they won’t find you
And if you believe, you can fly like I do

Absolutely beautiful, the type that make you feel unsuitable
She’s uncommon, ain’t nothing about her usual
If you’ve had known her before the transition
You’d be amazed by the change man, listen
She used to go from this one to that one
To feel complete, she looked for men to make it happen
Until she started asking, if all things in this world should pass then
Show me something that’s everlasting
That’s when she met true love, not the word but the action
Taking her to way back when, she was Eve in the garden of Eden (hehe)
Before the apple was eaten, before she used to be the Queen of clubs
Now it seems she’s a wild card, born again, child of God
With a style a little odd for any normal man to marry
But she fits in just fine with the revolutionaries

(chorus)
Outta the gates to the wild blue
Sky’s too great, she gotta escape, fly through
With a smile to kinda remind you
You gotta look ahead and not behind you
She said staring at the sun won’t blind you
It’s just a lie used by the world to confine you
But I know a place they won’t find you
And if you believe, you can fly like I do

[Verse 1]
Yo I heard a wise man once said
It ain’t all about the bread or cheese
Material gain please
Man I ease my way through this life
a little strife just me and my wife
whether I’m dead broke or rockin Ice
It ain’t hard I’m focused on God, Family and Hip Hop
When I hit the top
I’m saying who’s with me who’s out to get me
Who stuck beside through the fire and rain
Some envious some admire the gain
TR we travel the entire terrain
Yeah - so when the haters hate
It’s all good - I’m bout to live out a greater fate
Watch me move, I can’t lose
See I choose to fuse the truth
Every time I show and prove
Now you could love me or leave me diss me or dismiss me
You ain’t got time better make up your mind quickly

[Hook]
We going places only few been called
We gon’ take this music thing right to the stars
We gon’ spit until we can’t rip no more bars
We gon’ start this party right (Why) just because
Yeah we going places only few can see
Traveling cross country and the seven seas
Transcending the boundaries of color and creed
‘Cause the road to success has been named new breed

[Verse 2: Elsie]
Give me a line and I’ll spit y’all 16
Then pass me a color and I’ll paint for y’all my dream
Now hand me a mirror show you life ain’t what it seem
But give me a microphone and I’ll talk it to extreme
I swim against the stream and walk against the norm
Refine under pressure no I’ll never conform
Born conquerer, always ready for war
And now deemed superstar I’m geerin up for world tour
Trying to stake my claim in this hip-hop game
And yes I’m bent on stars marking tunnel rat name
We built for this terrain, I don’t need no fancy cars
i’ll drive my ford focused on premium bars
full speed ahead for the purspose and cause
breaking for no one but obeying God’s laws
there’s a stop up ahead you need to heed to my speed
cause the road to success has now been named new breed

Hook

(Verse 3: Elsie)
Ready to shine under brighter lights
brawl in the bigger fights
new breed taking their game into higher heights
Higher stakes, make no mistake
We gonna roll to the gold then the platinum plates

(Macho)
A yo I can’t think twice and won’t look back
The diary of my life is in my book of raps
I’m purposed by design to shine be the sower of seed
Murder the greed and let God lead

(Elsie)
So I’m gon’ uprok this rhythm to the great escape
label me no more I’m livin’ out my fate
great is the destiny
God use the worst and best in me
i’m ready to work until there ain’t nothin’ left of me

(Macho)
Yo it’s a thin line between the underground and the main stream
It takes a brave team to break through it
I though y’all knew it my verbal communication is fluid so I got to pursue it

.
.
[Mr. Lil One] Woo, that’s right, that’s right
              Lil’ One and Sicc
              Representing for the Southeast clan
[Young Sicc]  Uh, homie
              Straight up dog
[Mr. Lil One] You know how we do this

[Young Sicc]  Ain’t knowing how these eses put it down homie
[Mr. Lil One] I’ma break it down like this
              Sicc, tell em how we do dog

[Young Sicc]
It be that real riding steelo dog, that we’re bringing
To keep it gangsta, having everybody swingin
Never try and test those riders from the West Coast
Stomping through hoods packing heat up in the trenchcoats
Sicc and the Lil’ bring flavor like skittles
Ladies all hyped up screaming in the middle
Something never seen before, styles they’ve been fiending for
Something for them knuckleheads rolling with them beenies low
Gangsters make the world go round
So now they all bow to the Dago town
I put it down for all the homies from the hood to the pen
Six-trey Chevrolet got me hopping again
I got all my girlies loving it, because we’re thugging it
And got the industry knowing who be running it
Everybody loving it, everybody bumping
Southern Cali represent just to bring a little something

[Chorus: Young Sicc]
For my South, Southsiders, siders
For the East, Eastsiders, siders
For the West, Westsiders, siders
For my Southeast riders
For my South, Southsiders, siders
For the East, Eastsiders, siders
For the West, Westsiders, siders
For my Killer Cal riders

[Mr. Lil One]
Beware of the big dog, I get ferocious
Hypnosis, here’s a dozen roses
Poses for the camera, seems that we’re having a
Merry old time, shit this outta be a crime
Look at all these nickles trying to plug up with the Sickos
Begging for me to tickle them, begging for my pickle and
I’ma give it to em, but first I gotta finish up this verse
For my little homie Sicc, how it hurts
The worst is yet to come, it’s Sicc and Lil’ One
The party just begun, bottles full of rum
Ladies in bikinis, cholos with their beenies
Every little nickle got a bottle like they’re genies
Granting me whatever, but never never slip
I’m I rider from the South and I’m all about my chips
Sicc much love dog, handle what you gotta
Mr. Lil’ got your back, Mr. Evil Stigmata

[Chorus]

[Young Sicc]
You know we bring it the sick way, you got that heat pass it this way
Yeah, you know you’re riding with some eses
Who got the game sewed up from block to block
Hit em with something proper leave em all +Shellshocked+
I got bloods b-walking, got crips c-walking
Others done bowed down to the stuff that we’re talking
Known for keeping it gangster cuz gangster is what it is
Much love to my cousins Hoggy Dog and G-Whiz
For my BG’s and double OG’s and shot callers
Love to my doggy Spanks up in Chukawala
From the South Bay back to Southeast to Oceanside
Riders in the streets just wait to colide
San Diego tizown to the LBC
Compton and South Central to the SMB
The SGV, the East LA, y’all know what’s up
For my Killer Cal riders, let me see you toss it up

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1: Seven]
Come on, baby
Just drop the pannies and let’s get to it
You said you want to suck a freak, I wanna hit and split it
And commit it, but I don’t wanna be caught up
So let me bust one in your mouth and shit the spot, cause your time’s up
Your friends are calling from the next room
S-V-En, slip in Don dusk, what they consume
Triple X positions
Your body’s causing friction
Hard to tame, these pornographics is a heartache condition
I’ll even run rap, (???) like an ambulance
Fine bitch, on dick, wanna drop a pants
Yeah
We’re making money
We stackin’ G’s
Professionals who drop hoes on ease
In a drop-top base
I’m gonna hit
Switches on bitches when I tip through L.A.
In the carpool lane
Gettin’ skully on the freeway
Hurry up and take your clothes off, baby

Chorus: James Debarge
If you want it
Come get it
Please believe it
I hit it
I’m gon’ always
Come with it
Hurry up and take your clothes off

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Lil’ Demon]
I rip your clothes off
Damn, your body feels soft
Kinky with a fetish, I’m your pimp and boss
Turn around, baby girl, wanna hit it like that
Glancin’ in the leer, and I’m stroking your back
Yeah, you blushed out
Smell like a rose
Ring around your toes, sexy like J-Lo
Are you a bad girl
I’m putting up a front
Teasin’ little homies, not givin’ up none
Are you a freak
Love the late night creep
Down with S&M; and a little whipped cream
Tell me how you want it, but you gotta be real
No promises to love, just a night for a thrill
I know you married with you, and I ain’t tryin’ to play bad
Tryin’ to get you in trouble, or even break up your pad
Just call me your Sancho, Lil’ Demon the great
If you want it, come and get it, and I’m always ready to play

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Slow Pain]
I’m calling out names
Mona from Pomona
Tina, Lisa, Pheonix, Arizona
Monique from Dallas
Good ol’ Dallas
Little nasty freak I met at Caesar’s Palace
Nasty girl, you nasty
Taking off your clothes like Cathy
Five foot nine
Slide down the pole
T.V.’s in Alberquerque, V.I.P., front row
Miss Bernidete
Lil’ Mariah
Girl, you get me Higher like Earth, Wind And Fire
Diamonds and pearls, I love all these girls
Gangsta, gangsta in a gangster world
I got bad ones
From K.C. to L.A.
I got loved ones
Always down to parle
I keep it pimpin’
Cause that’s all that I know
I grab your girl by the hand at the end of the show

Repeat Chorus Four Times

[Kalin]
It’s nobody but you
Got me feelin’ some type of way, girl you know what I like
It’s nobody but you
Ain’t nobody else, you the only one that’s on my mind
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you

[Myles]
You the only one I want
And I can’t even lie, baby I won’t front
Cause every time you walk by
I be too shy tryna say hi
But you smile back anyway with a wave like uh
Got me fallin’ in love
Cupid hit me with an arrow
Hit me right in the butt, huh
Nothing, I’m just getting carried away
Tryna tell you how I feel is kinda hard to explain
But here it goes, look
Girl you so beautiful, in and out
I ain’t talkin’ bout burgers
But if you hungry then we out
We could go there, or anywhere you want to
I’m just happy when you come through

[Kalin]

And I’ll be right here for my girl she know what it is
It’s nobody but you
Got me feelin’ some type of way, girl you know what I like

Ain’t nobody else, you the only one that’s on my mind
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you

[Myles]
Okay now lemme break it down, lemme play the guitar
Tryna serenade ya girl
Tryna get to your heart
Cause every time I write a song, I’ll be thinkin’ of you
I’m just wonderin’ if you’re ever thinking about me too
Whats up
Young, beautiful
And every time you come around its like a high school musical
with my dance moves that I can’t do, but you stand through
You say I’m crazy, I’m just crazy for you
Oh my, goodness gracious
Girl you know you got me makin’ heart eye faces
And you know that I got patience
Uh, so take it slow, baby I don’t mind waiting for you

[Kalin]
Cause ain’t nobody else in the world got me feeling like this
And I’ll be right here for my girl she know what it is
It’s nobody but you
Got me feelin’ some type of way, girl you know what I like
It’s nobody but you
Ain’t nobody else you the only one that’s on my mind
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you

Ain’t nobody but you girl
I said ain’t nobody but you girl
Ain’t nobody but you girl
I said ain’t nobody but you, oh

Got me feelin’ some type of way, girl you know what I like
It’s nobody but you
Ain’t nobody else, you the only one that’s on my mind
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you-ou-ou-ou-ou
It’s nobody but you

This is your captain once again. As we make our descent
into Los Angeles we hope you had a pleasant flight.
The weather conditions are clear blue skies at 126 degrees
and we’ll be in the terminal in less than 30 seconds.
Once again thank you for flying Death Row West.

[Kangol Slim]

[Mista Menor]
Shit, watch shorty tear it down

Wobble wit it, wiggle wit it, hit the floor baby
Show ‘em how we do it from the N.O. baby
Don’t stunt, don’t front, show ‘em how to pop, and
Raise yo hands up, and show ‘em how to Tiddy Bop
Now back it up like a drunk, I take a load off
I would try to take you home, but I’ma hold off
I’m kinda drunk, kinda blowed, kinda throwed off
You gonna make a nigga like me straight go off
I probably would, if I could, but a nigga can’t
If you can do this in the club you probably make me faint
Now look at her?

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[5th Ward Weebie]
If you bend that ass over, spread them cheeks
Back it up Lil’ Weebie ‘til you touch that D

Cause I fucked a hoe, fucked a hoe

‘Til I Clutch the pussy, girl put this in yo mouth
That wood so hard, I’m bout to knock yo teeth out

[5th Ward Weebie-Chorus]

[L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
Yeah, I got the recipe flow, for all beat cookers
Pick and flick my hoes, like these boogers
I’m Biz Mark nasty, I rip parts from pansies
Whoever want it
I go and get it if I’m on it
J.L. win in the end
Kind of like The Warriors
Some won’t be there in the end, like The Warriors
Ponder that
100% if I’m on a track
10% grit mixed with 10% Dis
Follow me now, it’s 10% hot bars
Swallow me now, it’s 10% lock jaw
10% wildin’, 10% raw talent
Slate, I’m killin’ it, 10% L.ife E.xperience
10% wordplay, every verse that he say
20% cocky, the game is like hockey
N.H.L.
Cause Niggas Hate L.E.G.A.C.Y.
I raise hell, touchin’ fingers make destiny

[Sean Boog]
It’s my time now
Give me your attention
I want all of it
No duckin’ when I spit
When I hit, don’t miss
Accurate as chess
Maury Povich gives to his guests
To determine if the mom is a slut
Or if the pops is sick
My private is to check
I’m a private investigator
Greater than the rest
One breath from the lungs
Put craters in your chest, Moon Man
This world is doomed 
And my allegiance is for the heathens
Don’t assume you can take us out
Makin’ an ass our of you man
Me, I’m what I’m gonna be
All grown up at the age of 23
Come fuck with me
Trust me, you’ll catch me in your town
Things are goin’ too good
I think my teams wore down

[Joe Scudda]
I’m in the booth with my hat low
You know how that go
The hard shit
I’m gonna give you what you ask for
Miss and shoot the one
Fuck that, you know the name
Know the game, I know the pain like Novocaine
I took you out, picture, pulled the frame
I walk in the club and get love
Look, nobody even know you came
Man, you bitch made
Comparin’ me to you, is like a big ass machete to a switch blade
So by now
Know you can’t win
Get five of your people
I bring back ten
And if you bring ten, I’ma bring the whole team
I mean, my motherfuckers than yo ass ever seen

[Big Dho]
Hold up
Don’t forget about little ole’ me
There’s a problem that you could not see (nigga)
I’m outta school, better not test me
Get The Answer like Sean Boog and Oddisee (nigga)
I got seven on the track with me
Six more on the bus
15 from the League Of Justus
That’s 28 motherfuckers that’s ready to jump up
If I hear you talkin’ like you want WHAT?
Naw really
You can get knocked silly
Got many, walkin’ around here badder than Billy
And ain’t no question I can roast your crew
Spit that oil on you and grill you like my vegetables
As for you
Winnin’ ain’t an option so don’t believe that
You a feline pussy, I’m a street cat

[Chaundon]
It’s my game, gimmie that
I don’t play fair
Cocksucker, change rules when I wanna
Servin’ indies and majors
Most of them are ink wasters
Writin’ nonsense on paper
The best out, runnin’ it now
Hall Of Justus
Why the fuck you think Dho put me down?
Took it back, half moon in my wig
Can’t fit the crown now
I’m so arrogant, my heads too big
There ain’t a ?16-90?
Word on the street is I’m the truth
A year later I’m still sealin’ slow leaks
On tour with the LB, signin’ autographs
And I ain’t even drop a fuckin’ LP
Some biters wanna hate
Wait a minute, I get it
They were rappers that failed
Later on became critics
It ain’t my fault, I’m just that nice
For every word I write, labels should sign me twice
Nigga
 
H.O.J. [x4]
 
[Big Pooh]
Ayo fuck that 
H.O.J. is right now
Pussy niggas pipe down, you don’t want it with me
Raw dog fuck shit out of beats
It’s our first go round, challenger’s now obsolete
And to think this was so close to not being
Brothers ran, put it up, now niggas not seein’
Rush more than Russell
Look at the hustle
Motherfuckin’ ain’t tryin’ to tussle
This is rock solid
Dope product
Flow brolic
I’m a verbal alcoholic in search of help
Felt
In every state from city to city
Let me sign autographs and cop your girl’s titties
Simply the best, no if’s or and’s
The League’s +Notorious+ like Durand Durand
I done had it up to here with your bullshit scams
We the architects of the new plan

[Phonte]
Caught him on a cold night, mind wonderin’
A square nigga so they figured they could corner him
A true Capricorn, yeah he on that loner shit
But they couldn’t stop Tay
A.K.A. The One Nigga You Don’t Want It With
Known to rock mics
Each and every time the clock strikes
And quick to tell a nigga, "You not nice."
And I ain’t been locked up, down, or shot twice
The only shootin’ I did was shot dice
Now that my stock market has doubled in your market place
I’m like Lumberg shittin’ on your Office Space
Just wanna see the world and break bread with my brothers
But these niggas wanna drink and throw bottles at each other
It’s shit like that that makes me wanna run for cover
Tell a nigga, "Pack your shit." Straight cut a motherfucker
But I won’t do it to ‘em cause they need this alliance 
And deep down a nigga need guidance
And I understand the pain it give and the feelings of blasphemy
To rock a show to a crowd that’s half capacity
And all the other road shit you supposed to figure
But it’s the Tour Of Duty and we all soldiers nigga
C’mon

[Sean Boog]
This is our game
Here to the end so remember the name
This is our turf
Earth to the sun, shit the whole universe
This is ours now
Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down
This is our shit
We don’t miss, all we do is make hits

Cureee Again!
Put your lighters up again

To the people, and all the children of the world
If you can see it, it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not far away
Before you can reach it
You must endure the pain

Real talk you can touch the sky
Make no doubt about it noooo
Real talk you can sit pan high

Real talk we do it for the youths, another generation
Yea you’re strong enough to meet your destiny say

Nothing, nothing is impossible
No one can hold us down
We, Yeah we are unstoppable
Cause nothing is impossible

If the door doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t open
Don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t wait use force to knock it down
Ain’t no time for mopping,

Real talk you can touch the sky
Make no doubt about it noooo

Real talk we do it for the youths, another generation
You are strong enough to meet your destiny say

[Yelawolf]
Trailer parks on fire, Billy been cookin up somethin
If you need a biscuit come on then, Billy just got it jumpin
Get it from a pro, get it for the low, get you some blow
Get it for the nose, get it for the show, get it for the HOES!
Four-wheeler cranked up, gas tank on the ATV
It’s full of that crank bud, Billy got pills from A to Z
So what do ya think bud? Billy won’t go below fifty
22’s are dangerous, trigger finger full of nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle, how you feelin now?
Purple moons and lucky charms, yeah that’s the sound
With veins turnin brown, but his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun, they goin Billy now

[Chorus: Janine Booth] + (Yelawolf) + {Rock City}
Billy’s on the corner with the crystal meth
(Yeah, and he ain’t slowin down, slowin down)
B-B-B-Billy’s on the corner with the crystal meth
(Go Billy!) The-the-the-the crystal meth
{Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-oh-ohh! Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-ohhhhh-ohhh!}
{Oh-oh-ohh! Ay-ay-ayy! Oh-ohhhhh-ohhh!}

[Yelawolf]
Hello junkies, and hello momma too
Hello to my P.O., deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls, twenty pounds on the catwalk
LSD and Adderall, and LCD’s on the wall
He’s watchin every move, high tech redneck
Run up on ‘em if you want to, I bet, really?
C’mon, it might be dark in the woods (dark in the woods)
But the lights are on (lights are on)
The money’s counted (money’s counted) and if the price is wrong
Well then, Billy will get them +Gremlins+ like Spielberg
He’ll take your house down, off of them pill-ars
And take your mom to Sizzler, and feed her chicken liver
That’s cold-blooded love, Billy’s a chiller

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
4:30 in the AM, Billy ain’t slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit, gotta keep up with the craze
It’s a heavy shade (shade) gotta walk through the maze (maze)
Down where the sun don’t shine, and the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew, and the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy, and up come an able male
Momma stayed at work, daddy stayed in jail
Hey that’s a full deck, but you gotta play with what ya dealt
So Billy dealt the joker, put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober and pissed in a supersoaker
And he wet ‘em all up, and left his snow yellow
That’s hard white, boy, for the L-O

[Chorus]

[Intro]
"And another one, oh... Yes!"

[Verse 1]
The pimp in me sayin nigga just chill

(Chorus...)

[Verse 3]
Don’t listen to the thug homie that nigga wilin

homie I go hard prayin to the pimp god
and I gives a lot to Allah and build with the gods

so holla at a thug if you ever need muscle

[Chorus 1]
China white, crystal meth, angel dust, percaset, cocaine, morphine, PCP
Hash, opium, prozac, special K, Xanax, mushrooms, LSD
 
[Verse 1]
The illicit hard drug industry is one trillion
Annual, you think you want to end this? Fantasy!
International ?? eradicate, futile
Assassinate Pablo Escobar, perhaps your middle man,
Noriega, not a dip in the system
Increase shipments in the wake of a so-called victory
For the DEA, no mystery
Check the data, black, steady G in they history
Around the world drug lords are aided and assisted
Production, transportation, distribution of drugs,
Receiving armed assistance, thugs,
Drug czars keepin the prosecution bugged
It’s like that, Cold War strategy
No war on drugs, but war for drugs
A war to win love
In the hearts and minds of these
In battle regions around the globe
Solidly impoverished with guns to the dome
 
[Chorus 2]
Ecstasy, sugar, caffeine, thorazine, demerol, alcohol, nicotine, vicadin
Trail mix, mescaline, ice, sherm, rufenol, methadone, qualudes, burn
 
[Verse 2]
In the street gangs is big money
Petty cash to the major
Distributor, empires are built,
Lives killed, for a hundred keys a week,
Ask Mr. Rick Ross
Uzis is bought, body bags on the lawn
Mr. Ollie North says nothing’s wrong
With guns and droppin dimes while niggas do time
Arms secretly sold overpriced to Iran,
The infamous Contragate weapons scam,
Notorious crooks-for-money gun operations,
For the conservatives no labor pics is taken,
The President, Senate subcommittees documented,
Officials tolerate Contra link drug victims,
December ‘75, the watchtower mission,
Established a series of three electronic beacons,
Towers from Bogota all the way to Panama,
Were activated, aircrafts can fly so invisible,
Defense forces, CIA agents is waiting for the shipments,
Profits from narcotic vicious
Laundered to Swiss bank accounts
And never droughts
 
[Chorus 2]
 
[recording]
It’s called Air America, the CIA front, the CIA, soldiers, mercs
They’ve been bringing it in ever since . . .
 
[Chorus 1]
 
[Verse 3]
It’s gets critical the cover-up,
Operation Oil Well,
There’s more to tell
Special forces spying on well,
No political, law enforcement and Catholic
Churches, judges give white male detergent,
Bugs and phone taps, civilians gettin’ trapped,
World diagrams, naval charts, ill maps,
All the drama collected from phone taps
Goes to Washington, how the corporations use that
It’s leverage, manipulate ??? to approve cause,
On many weapons, drug funds, secret wars or
Armored vehicles, invisible
Aircrafts, illegal controls the whole world black

{*sound of someone blowing a line*}
[talking] This is big business...
[police] Search warrant, please open the door

Jas Mace Verse

It was like a dream, something I’ve never seen
Something like a model posing in a magazine
Maybe Vogue, maybe SPUR, maybe Elle
Man you get the picture, these words couldn’t tell
But there she was looking so elegant
Didn’t think I had a chance but I kicked it for the hell of it
She’s out of town only here on a business trip
Trying to get a sip of Bacardi before she leaves the party
I bought her drink as we exchanged a couple jokes
A couple glances eye to eye that’s when I knew it’s time to go
We shared a taxi gently touching in the back seat
She whispered in my ear, won’t tell you what she asked me
Went to the room, she said she likes the view
I looked her up and down and said, yeah I like it too
She smiled then hit the lights, but the rest is a fog
Then I awoke to a note, said it was great love Mirage and she was gone

Thurro Chorus

Sexy lady, stay ‘til the morning
I want you bad, with that pretty little dress that your in
I got a, I got a baby
Ain’t going nowhere
This can’t be real
If I’m dreaming it sure ain’t fair
It was just a midnight mirage

Marchitect Verse

She appeared out of nowhere where the surf lays
With the face of a goddess wide tail like a mermaid
Could it be, she’s looking at me
Is she from an island in the Arabian Sea
Might be related to Lisa Raye
You know I like them nice and nasty like Michel’le
But I like them like them classy that’s the least to say
You see that girl’s booty 50 feet away
Okay, wasn’t thinking she was digging on the kid
But she whispered in my ear started licking on her lips
She led me to her Benzo, drove me to her condo
Led me to her bedroom, started rolling bomb smoke
Taking off her clothes now, put them where the floor is
She moves in 6 speeds like Andressa Soares
And just as sure as the sun will rise
She was very long gone, she was just a mirage

Thurro Chorus

Sexy lady, stay ‘til the morning
I want you bad, with that pretty little dress that your in
I got a, I got a baby
Ain’t going nowhere
This can’t be real
If I’m dreaming it sure ain’t fair
It was just a midnight mirage

Puttin it down for all the shot callas and the big ballas in the town, feel me

Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game

It all starts off when ya grindin sellin rocks
Then ya mind expands you wanna sew up the block
And be the man so you pull all night shifts, currency flips, like gymnastics
And you gotta stay strapped cause fools be jackin
Leavin niggas missin in action but we ain’t havin that
Fat ass gats are tucked tight, as you grind every cop
grind every cop night after night
Young hustlas be at this, tryin to blow up to the kilogram status
And it feels fantastic, cause you know that you on your way
Forty keys a week, knockin off zips a day with no sleep
Passed the peak at forty overtime, hella high sharper than a porcupine (ouch)
Wit your eyes lookin shady, it’s big ballin baby

Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, the next level, the next level
Shot callin and big ballin, in the game, advance to the next level in the game

Now my pocket done blew up like rockets
Call me NASA, helpin my money get blasted
You can’t handle that 69 cancer crowd
Bust a half-a-jacka, in the midst a gettin dealt wit (fo sho)
They call up Silky to con, milk these fools like cows boo-gow
Laya playa down forty letters form the crown
So gettin gee-chee shot callin and ballin through the town
Now how you like us now you probably don’t
Cause we be bubblin straight lace hustlin
Don’t be trustin fools that be smilin in the face
Schemin like demons on the under for papes
Underground tapes dope sold by crates cause
It’s the ballin ass whoridas, call the shots on 
playa hatin niggas for they dollas
Wringin collas, makin neighbors holla, smashin off in Impalas (errrrrrr)

Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, the next level, the next level
Shot callin and big ballin, in the game, advance to the next level in the game

Now we lettin fools know what time it is wit this here
Cali shots then disappear, and shift the gear
Keep my ear close to the ground, nigga what you hollerin, Westbound
Grew up in dog town, wit a natural perpetual frown,
And it’s still on til this day, check the game and peep the play
By hostile big ballas, I got the sauce to set it off
And raise you up from the spot snatch the chamber back
On that G-lock, and let it pop, Ha-San Chop (yeah)

Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, advance to the next level in the game
Shot callin and big ballin, the next level, the next level
Shot callin and big ballin, in the game, advance to the next level in the game

Who-ridas, hobo records, hobo junction, the year of the ticket, 96 man

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH!
Y’all already know what it is, this is fam
Yo, Brooklyn raise up (come on)
Uptown raise up, Queens
Staten Island, the Boogie Down

[Chorus: Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Aiyyo some people die for it (And some live it)
Some people snatch what they can (And some give it)
It’s not how you play the game (It’s how much you win)
Fuck the wages of sin, we gon’ hustle
(We don’t get by) We multiply
(We don’t settle for less) We take the whole pie
(Don’t gamble, we invest) Cause the stakes is high
(Whether we live or we die, we gon’ hustle)

[Talib Kweli]
You all comfy when shit is paid up, like the car note or your rent
Look out you broke, and now you got more Hustle than Larry Flynt
Diggin up dirt on politicians when you got no pot to piss in
Sellin watches for commission, with fake rocks that don’t glistin
Holdin up a block position, been a lot of options,
for you to get in, stop the bitchin!
You just ain’t makin no hot decisions - where the blood clot?
Look how many gold-diggers the clubs got
If you ain’t up on the hustle, find yourself doin the bus-stop,
or the train station, with the change, waitin for a metro card
Petrified, cuz once you get the dough to let go is hard
I’m a vet though and it’s odd to see these new cats splurgin
Industry virgins think money make ‘em a better person
Sign to ya mans label, which is under a label, under a parent label,
apparently you ain’t even able to sit down at the table
You ain’t braggin about seein the dough,
You braggin about bein a ho
Don’t be mad at me, be mad at’cha boys,
I just thought you needed to know

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they try to gas me up (gas me up)
But I don’t fall for the flattery
Just keep the people charged like assault with a battery
Now your mad at me, and your squad wanna battle me
Cuz every line I spit, got a money-back guarantee
With a lifetime warranty, just keep the receipt
Universe is passing moments, but my world is the street
They can’t dance and when they hustle, they trip over they feet
They tryna make ends meet like when they cipher complete
I used to wanna be a star when I was a spectator
So now I’m legendary, when I die I’ll be greater
It’s funny how life is just like an elevator
But major life changes ain’t nuttin to be afraid of
Remember (-member) nuttin in this life come free
Cuz if I take from you, somebody else gon’ take it from me
And I’ll be damned if I let somebody take it from me
Shit I’ma do for y’all the way you never did it for me
Come on

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Up in the city that never sleeps, black mommas forever weep,
and cats whip Jeeps equipped with fashion designer leather seats
But the team is never beat, and we always weather the heat
Stay with that mentality, I’ll bet y’all niggas never eat

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they callin me the Devil’s Advocate,
but they don’t know the half of it
The lone catalyst, shaped for my master shit
Make it tangible, firmin up the hand of these apes
Who can’t grasp because intense, so they rewindin my tapes
Yo Kweli!

[Talib Kweli]
We count down to armageddon like 1, 2, 3, 4
We raw like C4, been here before and after
You up and down like a see-saw,
With your fake hustle, that beats more
Like when I ask my three year old son to make muscles

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Cuz muscles come in all shapes, and mine take the form of breath
So when I spit the air is thick enough to beat you to death
See to die is to have lived, but you can’t even die right
You like a candle on the sun, nigga you just a waste of light

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Come on eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
(It’s like, it’s like, it’s like)
Come on, come on, come on (Uh, uh, uh, it’ like)
Yea yea yea yea yea yea (Yo, it’s like, uh)
Yea yea yea (Come on it’s like)
Raw Series, Mr. Man (Come on, it’s like)
(Yo, yo, it’s like)
Kweli, Reflect ‘Ternal
(Y’all wanna get a peice) C-Smith
Rawkus Records, Raw Series Entertainment
Make it nice like that for you..

When you die what you own on Earth won’t be coming with you
So all that fat shit you’ve got, I ain’t trippin that ain’t an issue
If you’ve got vibes, on a cool level we can talk but if you live lies
Through material-fertilized eyes and fantasize then walk
I use my vocals like chalk to sketch the picture you can see it
See unfold what I thought in my mind when I free it
Did the swallow get caught?  Yo does your throat feel tight?
Do you see what can happen when Atmosphere grabs the mic?
Just a word for you its funny and I think you caught its fever
All that shit you watch on tv has made you a believer
You don’t have to like me bitch, cuz I don’t really like you either
I don’t care if you’re rich, I had your girl, and I’m a leave her
Word I’m eager, to disrespect the petty thoughts of many reps
As I take steps and climb and leave footprints on your mind
I’ve designed my own lifestyle words and vowels instead of "rifals"
And hang out with rhymepals who tower like the "Eiffel"

[talking for eight bars]
Chorus[all]:
A lot of things change and somethings don’t
A lot of people fall off and some say they won’t
That’s right (That’s right) x2
Cuz we’ll fuck up your life like a crack pipe

[Extreme]
It’s the TC’s original b-boy Extreme
So when a nigga calls next you better pick your team
I hit the seam like doublestitch, twitch and get bent
A Rhymesayer nothing less than one hundred percent
You cats are far from inventive, cool and calm
I destruct an angled emcee before the touch of dawn
My wand be makin niggaz go "poof" with smoke
Nothing left but adidas, X ain’t no joke
I’m not out to get the quote of the month
Fuck a stunt
I’d rather grab the microphone and give you what you want
Opposite of a flaunt cuz my shits bang hard
Yeah you bust but I’m black jack you pulled the wrong card
There may be one too many I give you plenty like excessive
If you’re wack and grab the mic you end up in a state of depressive-
-Ness yes, couldn’t pass the test with a calculator
Rhymes like piranha, beat designed by the ANTinator
Hater never, I just wait till you’re tired
And then I give your ass a ticket cuz that last shit’s expired
Better yet tired, cuz your position’s been terminated
Wack niggaz bug me like pests and get exterminated

[Chorus]

[Slug]
(Yo Yo Yo)
Wanted to see if it was alive, started poking it (All:Pokin it!)
How could it survive when you’re chokin it? (All:Chokin it!)
When I can get a firm grip, I’m holdin it (All: Holdin it!)
And when I’m broke, I wear my girls deodorant [laughs]
Wait, did I say my girl, I meant my pimp
Cuz she’s the one with the money, and she walks with a limp
And honey, if you wanna purr you gotta register with her
Cuz she gets ninety five percent before any events occur
Sir, your self-imploding ego is adorable
Word, but your immature stee-lo is ignorable
I don’t know, maybe I’m just getting too old to flow
How much more must I invent before you seek retirement?
Repent and tell God that you feel shitty bout your actions
Bent in the back and I can only blame my passions
Well rounded relapses kept me at a fraction
When the wind died I found myself spread across the Tascam
How much thought did you put into that verse you brought?
What made you think I wasn’t gonna mock? Put a fucking tube sock
In that hole because I think it started to leak
Take two dicks and call me in a week

[Chorus] - 2X

[Talking]
Whats Happenin the grawl nitty camped out nigga
The halocaust in 98 playa
We the sickess all the time on the grind
All they got to do is say when nigga
If you in the way you just gone get rolled on believe that
You think I’m playin with you let me show u something

[C-Loc]
Where its at nigga, where its at nigga
Where the dope at nigga with my mug on 
Concentration camp savage bout his cabbage in the war zone
Down to break a jaw bone you hustlers know that sound
Central booking for fucking ‘round whoa now
In a city where black folks wanna holla
Cause the white folks don’t wanna see a nigga with a dollar
But we still on the highway trying to get the dope back by friday
Can careless ‘bout what the fucking feds say

[Lay Lo 1]
Camp affiliated so start antiating gats nigga
Plated or black nigga
Aint taking no more stacks bitch
We breaking your back
I’m making your scrash for me
We say its simple and plan cuz thats the way it has to be
I grab my thang and blast for you, you grab your shit and blast for me
And we get mixed up in some mess we cause catasterfee
A nigga can’t get mad at you if he don’t get mad at me
Now we passing the microphone like we used to pass the weed

[Lay Lo 2]
Aight nigga we got business to attend to as a bitches gone surrender
Country side gangster shit nigga, and we weigh cigars
Me and my nigga chopping streets like a butcher
With thangs in seat cushions 
Fuck a ghetto rap pushers
We beefing with haters and tryin to come up off of these sacks
Gave up my everyday nina fina for these raps
And if these tracks, don’t get my shit on swole
I ain’t got nothin to loose, nigga we ready to fold

[Chorus- Young Bleed]  x 2
You do it savage nigga
You ‘bout that cabbage nigga
Fuck, you gotta have it nigga
Addition to the habbit nigga
Want it better grab it nigga
Adjust to livin lavage nigga
Hustlin just a habbit and keep it hopin like a rabitt nigga

[Lucky Knuckles]
Let me know if ya ready
To show I’m down for confedi
Ain’t got no time for the fake niggas sippin hot ones in they belly
This shit gets heavy for me, tru playas hustle for cheese
Respect the young nigga mind I’m only out to get me
I ain’t got time for that bull-shit, frontin you get dunked on
I live by the streets, never leave my home, without my crome (Nigga)
[Young Bleed]
So what you wanna do with a ill matic, phyco-patic
Nappy nigga causin static
I hope you ready for steady stackin fedi, cause it don’t stop with me
Everytime I doubt on my dough somebody (bitches) watchin me
I play it like it gotta be
Mashin in a high phillosophy
Runnin in it get it hollin’ what u got for me, (Nigga)

[C-loc]
Fuck that frontin bitch I feel like killing something
Something ain’t my thing so I’m a bang if I hear’ em mumble
Bumble like a baby known to beat a bitch to death
Or grab them things and make’ em range on the last nigga left
Dear God up in heaven, why must I all ways think of 211s
And 187s please help this felon
Makes his way back to the spot without gettin popped
Or snatched up out local cots and doing life like my pops

[Boo the Boss Playa]
Nigga, how you gettin your money, huh, slow or fast
I got 160 on the dash
500 on the ass, S class
Fuckin ‘round with them hood rat tramps
Tryin to lead them hoes back to the camp, (so i can set it out for sho)
If you a freak bitch, then let it out
All my playa partnas don’t mind, throwing up in your mouth
You see that arrow pointed towards the bottom, we call it the south
4 silly birds 500 an ounce

[Leetyme]
Drop the chesse in the cage with 30 hungry gorillas
Who the last to snatch, who you callin a killa
The smell of blood of my enemy make my dick like stone
Wanna leave him dying alone then jackin off with his own
Look at me my back by the wounds of your whip
Look at me I’m spyin on the woman you split
And these niggas so trippin, so busy playa hatin me
When them folks done gripped and got your mammy in the streets

[Chorus]  x 2

Ay, a gremlin with gangrene is somethin to see boy
Tried to kill myself but used myself as a decoy
You can feel the recoil, making your skin crawl
Smokin heroin chasing a dragon on tin foil
You can see the dragon fly away from the tin foil
I kinda miss my kinfo
Life in an insult
Ay, goodfella but I’m hella poor
Skull bandanna, black hoody like Skeletor
Shoot a couple psychos and I turn into Great Ape
Vice grips, ice picks, zap straps and grey tape
Ay, I chop em up at the pork store
Stick em like a cork board
Rock like the warp tour
B-A-X-W-A-R-R
Any white boy beat me? hardy har har!
One fourty four four nine nine thirty eigths
I’m the little devil tryin to break inside the pearly gates

Each verse nuclear bomb with atomic hook
So much ink on my skin I’m a comic book
Pop so many pills I was seeing pink elephants, irrelevant
Ill still rip your skull from your skellaton
Drink a pesi cola while I ride a silver surf board
North west is mine you don’t want to start a turf war
Gladiator dawg, mad child king corso
Thor’s war hammer knock your brain to your torso
You get it? that means its honkey strong
That means I drop this fuckin mallet like Donkey Kong
So keep your tonsils shut
Cause I will crush a mother fucker like a monster truck
You better listen up [x2]
I’m a heathen, a gremlin, an ogre a tyrant
Hallucinating like the mike is dipped in psyllocybin
Mad’s maniacal. Motor mouth on a hot-streak
Used to shop at Gucci, now I stop at the swap meet
I’m like Popeye eating spinach for concerts
I’m a miniature monster I will diminish and conquer
Spewing venom with the dragon of the blessed palace
I’m thinkin of a challenge drinkin from this special chalice
Soldier demons and scavengers of the damned
Passengers in my van? "A massacre is at hand!"
I let a hundred snakes loose, I’m delusional
Then dance around in space boots, I’m confusing you
Stun guns, bear traps, gangsters on cocaine
I got dragon’s breath, spinning fire, and propane
I’m sending out my surrogates
So I can stay home, write rhymes and keep flourishin’
Hands dirty, stand sturdy with assertiveness
Every word I mutter is a murderous advertisement
"Help me!" Thant’s the cry of a true looney
Cause I feel like fucking dying, I’m crying with 2 tooneys[?]
Seven golden angels, Chemical warfare
Deadly mustard gas attacks, acid flashbacks
See, I come from the future, that’s a very gloomy place
I’m the Silver Surfer and I’m wiping out the human race
You? You a plastic gangster with a pocketknife
Me? I keep it gangster and I rock the mike
It’s Mr Mystery, a formula with infinite depth
Feel the wind from my breath
Ay! Misbehaving raving lunatic, Twelve Monkeys
Disengage a crazy moody prick, ex-junkie
Lazy-ass buffoon, but I’m crazy as a loon
Now I’m riding a flying dinosaur and waving at the moon
You better listen up [x4]

Yeeeaah, yo, YO!

This is motherfucking Louis Logic
and I got my nigga Rude 1 on the boards, aight?
‘bout to make shit hot in the house for the psy-chos

Yo;

It’s your favourite talk show host
with thoughts so close to disturbed
most of my words are cheap shots that no one deserves
so when the beat drops, so do the skirts and girls in knee socks
‘priest locked the doors and had to close up the church
my nigga Rude says: "Blow up you jerk, you’re like a child going berserk
without his ritalin for quite a while"
I just left from the hospital without a prescription
a lousy condition, now they’re freaking out cause im missin’
bound for suspicion, fleein’ in my hospital gown
with cops all around, I’ll stop for a round
Logic’s in town- drop your drawers baybayyy
*you’re craaazay!!*
But I love breaking the law, that’s why the local courts hate me
I’m like a pugilist, prone to moodiness
instead of using words to talk I’d rather use my fist
I’ll black and blue your lips until it’s swellin’ up your cake hole
if someone’s offered logics album, tell ‘em just to say no
‘Cause it’s addcitive as six hits of dope
mixed with dro after youve been sniffin’ coke
You pussy motherfuckers need to fix your flow
like the pills they use for kid control, now niggaz know

ladiiiesss
honk your horn if you’re in love with a psy-cho
who might go out on the prowl, rockin’ a night robe
just say you love me, ‘cause im a nutcase
and you can spend our honeymoon wrapped up in duct tape
fellaas
suck my dick if you don’t love all my rap songs
I’ll hunt you down in a black thong with an axe drawn
this cat’s gone right over the cuckoo’s nest,
and I ain’t comin’ back with any scruples left

So what’s that sayin’ about death and taxes?
it’s the same with logic because it’s guaranteed my record’s fattest
Forget your movie set dramatics cause I’ll catch you bastards and I’ll dead
your status like a pregnant actress
whatever happens, i’m set for action like a movie director
so kiss my sweaty ass when it comes through the projector
the only role I play, is the booty inspector
a nudist aggressor in nike shoes with reflectors
Two thumbs up, when Lou comes up
for the huge drunk lush who likes to chew punks up
and if you want smut, you bet your ass I can deal in dirt
peel the skirt off your sister while you get your feelin’s hurt
This ain’t the time to be a cry baby
Why hate me? because I’m swimming in fly ladies?
If I take three days to write one verse,
it’s only cause I ate your sisters slit till my tongue hurts
*this guys some jerk*
Nah I’m just a fight starter
who woke up in a funk like I used my right guard up
Shit, you ain’t lookin’ for a wife are ya? (naa)
I know your steeze bitch, you probably got a life partner

ladiiiesss
honk your horn if you’re in love with a psy-cho
who might go out on the prowl, rockin’ a night robe
just say you love me, ‘cause im a nutcase
and you can spend our honeymoon wrapped up in duct tape
fellaas
suck my dick if you don’t love all my rap songs
I’ll hunt you down in a black thong with an axe drawn
this cat’s gone right over the cuckoo’s nest,
and I ain’t comin’ back with any scruples left

COOCOOOOOO, COOCOOOOOO

Uhh, yeah yeah
I forgot my fuckin’ medication today
...it’s gonna be a long one
niggaz gettin’ in my way-
I tell ya what dude
im creepin’ up on you in a pair of leopard skin undies
know what im sayin’?
and I got a big fat fuckin’ machete with your name all over it
I’m ‘bout to put that shit to your neck and sliiicee
and make a big fat smiley face
a smiley face, you know what im sayin’?
Rude 1 motherfucker
Louis Logic
Chiii-cago
and New York connect
you know what I’m sayin’?

[Let’s puff this J]

(CHORUS)
When I close my eyes I see the world and see just who you are
It’s hard to walk away but you got ??? let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
[Ha, ha] Let’s puff, OK?

It soothes thee
To be
Movie
Party
Like Hennessey
Scars thee
Bacardi
Emcee with no depth
Leave him swept
Under the rug kept
And check with the tug-of-war
Your sore
‘Cause my score is high
‘Cause I show I
What is in my eye for vision
I take you on the journey, listen
As we travel, unravel, Rumpelstiltskin
Rollercoast breaking ground
Every word heard in cars, headphones
Javelin, travelin’, violin lost in the storm of life [life]
[Uh-hu-hiii]
[That’s some new shit] [That’s right]

(CHORUS)

You always fall in love with the wrong one
For all the right reasons, attraction ain’t dumb
Or smart; fun can be pain
When you became
Nothing’s the same
Finding lame answers
To fill void blame has dances
Same backup droids to the same ol’ drama
Diploid like meiosis
Psychosis of two worlds that could have became hate
Is bating to the enormous fate of life
Never beyond the gate
Of those who can’t translate reality
Needing badly to see
Insecurity is eternity in denial
Aim
Blame
Only creates toilet-tissue barriers
Carriers
To the virus of ignorance
You can’t smoke a blunt with us ‘cause he’s blank
Is that why the ??? ashes shanks
That’s why your shit just sank
Motherfuckers never even knew why
Trapped in that thing called stank [And that shit ain’t \xc2\x8a]
D-d-d-d-dank

[You fuckin’ with bammer. You fuckin’ with bammer. You fuckin’ with bammer.]

(CHORUS X 2) - [On first chorus, no repetition of "Let’s puff this J"]

Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff, OK?
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J
Let’s puff this J

Sometimes you just gotta sit back, you know what I’m sayin’?
Crumble it up, look out the window
maybe light some incense, you know what I’m sayin’?
Get in the mood or maybe you just kickin’ it at a bus-stop
know what I’m sayin’?
It’s the last Zig-Zag that you tucked away in your wallet
And the bus about to come and you only have, like, you know, three minutes
[Let’s puff this J]
Everybody talkin’ shit around you, you just wanna get away
You go in the bathroom, you light up endo
Open up the window, start thinking
[Let’s puff this J]
All the bills just came, and you can’t pay nothin’ today
Everything’s just messin’ with you
Maybe momma callin’ you for whatever
People just can’t \xc2\x8a they won’t stop fuckin’ with you!
Unplug your damn phone
[Let’s puff this J]
Let’s do something
Let’s just relax, fool
Come on, you gotta relax for a minute
Somethin’ to think about
Come on, let’s puff this sucker
You can - you can’t puff too long, though
You’ll burn your fingertips
You’ll burn your fingertips

[Verse 1: Max B]
I tell niggaz to ante up
Let the family fuck, bitch, why you pull ya panties up, stand me up
Sit me down, hit me with the pound, I’m a keeper
You niggaz outta style like beepers
Bigga, he’s teacher, he could show you loops that you never seen
Fruits from the Evergreen
I’m the quality pedigree, young Bron James with the ball
But on the weak, I’m ashamed of y’all
Claim the fame to call myself Bigg, Jigg, and Pac, hit the cigs a lot
Mami, she like to lick the cock, skip the drop (skip it)
7-60 V12 for the winter
Take your shoes off before you enter
Get her dentures a good cleaning, speed in ‘em till they get white
This nigga he like Mekhi Phiph’, actor
Fuck you tryna rap for, even though I’m comfty
(They can never take the game from a young G)

[Chorus: Max B]
Yeah
I like six-fours and thick hoes
Just look at the way she walk, my shit grows
Life is a bitch, you know how the shit goes
(They can never take the game from a young G)
[Repeat]

[Verse 2: Mac Mustard]
My nigga, we stack bread, let it fly through the roof
Take the leash off the vinyls, let ‘em fly through ya Coupe
Watch him fly off the stoop, trippin’ over trashcans
Got this shit infected like the trashman
Cash fam will get a nigga laid on his ass fam
Jimmy couldn’t ride the wave, now he yellin’ "Splash" fam, damn
Niggaz ask what type of zone you be in
Kuz I keep the six parked, and we drive the 5 like a UBN
Let you pick a nigga like UPN
And leave his brains all over the hood of his new BM
‘80’s baby, raised off of Rakim and Kool G Rap
Spit slugs that knock the pins off ya bitch doobie rap
Leave a nigga laid out on the corner of his block
Throw the press on and leave his ass cornered with his rocks
Better warn him that I pop, hit his head with the warning shot
(They can never take the game from a young G)

[Chorus: Max B]
Yeah
I like six-fours and thick hoes
Just look at the way she walk, my shit grows
Life is a bitch, you know how the shit goes
(They can never take the game from a young G)
[Repeat]

[Verse 3: Max B]
Heavy on the wristwear, shit real glittery
I puts ya outta ya misery
Piffery, slippery, get me in a jam, I can ease out
Dropped the Domain, had ‘em fiend out
Had ‘em bowing down to the great one, niggaz praise me like the Buddha
My music slways moves ya, lose ya
Leave ya in the woods till it stinks up, get ya links up
Nigga you best to drink up
Nigga you best, stop fuckin’ with me, I’m a grizzly
Glide through the city like a frisbee, mama dig me
Wanna suck, fuck, wanna let the team get a taste
I’m tryna do it in her face
Do it for the cake, kuz it’s needed, beat it
Homie best to step, things are almost completed
This murder case, so I’m weeded, I’m gettin’ money, B
(They can never take the game from a young G)

[Chorus: Max B]
Yeah
I like six-fours and thick hoes
Just look at the way she walk, my shit grows
Life is a bitch, you know how the shit goes
(They can never take the game from a young G)
[Repeat]

Stay afloat
When it feels like it’s all going nowhere
And you want it all
But the tide keeps trying pull you under
Let it go
You can’t fight the waves, boy, it’s no wonder
If you wanna grow
Don’t fight what’s natural (it’s only natural)

Listen to the rush, lose it to the rush
Listen to the rush, lose it to the rush
Let it rush all over, let it rush
Listen to the rush
Let it rush all over, let it rush
Listen to the rush, lose it to the rush

I do, I do the things I do (oh, oh, if you want it now)
\xc3\x82\xc2\xbfQuer\xc3\x83\xc2\xadas salvarte? D\xc3\x83\xc2\xadmelo (Papi siento que es tan natural)
I got so much to say (to say)
And I don’t find my strength (my strength)
I never make you change
I’d never do that to you
Cause time stops still
Feels like it’s all going nowhere
Time’s not real
And when it’s drifting away
Cause the time stops still
Feels like we’re all going under
The tide’s not real
And we’re just drifting in space

Listen to the rush, lose it to the rush
Listen to the rush, lose it to the rush
Let it rush all over, let it rush
Listen to the rush
Let it rush all over, let it rush

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
How about some Don Perigone, before we start to carry on
You know I’m on the grind, so I can’t stay very long
Everytime I hear the radio, it’s like every song
Make me think of you and me, gettin’ our merry on
Like a cherry on, top of cake and ice cream
Cheech and to the Chong, me and you is like a nice dream
Lookin’ so classy, lookin’ so jazzy
Down for the daddy, your boy, Bash Bashy
I’m on some late night hype, so I might not make it home

Repeat Chorus

Eye candy

[Buckshot]
Buckshot rock niggas like kicks
Sport hos like clothes
Cock back the double barrel, used to be broke like an arrow
Walk a real narrow, path, you don’t know the half
Nigga you ain’t do the math, add up
As I bag up, weed from the stash
Win the war, throw the flag up
Course right, fuck beein quit
I’ma blast thru the nuzzle of my gun, first, then burst
When you see the worst, it was Buckshot
Little Tazmanian, black Damien
Purpose is to pull the plug and shoot the enemy inside the mug
Like what, Buck never gave a fuck

One-Two
Aiyo One-Two---- Redman
*repeated over*

[Buckshot]
Thru the mist of the black smoke
One toke, take a hit, inhale in some real ill shit
What you about to deal with is the worst in here
I’m 5 foot 4, raw little nightmare
Givin heavy not a light stare
Concentrate to hit my target on sight
Now who gon get it tonight
A few bitches on my list now
a few niggas get me pissed now, but who gon get dissed now
First, I kick a verse for them niggas that thurst for the liquid
When I kick it, check it
True soldier, started as a teen in rap thing
Now I’m like the rap Don King
Blastin thru the city with, no car
While you drivin your city whip, where ya jar nigga?

*more "one-two’s" scratched*

[5 Ft.]
The problem is you didn’t listen when I warned you
Now I took five step, now I’mma lawn you
Evaluated, elevated, escalated, exellerated
Even became more educated
Comin thru fully equiped, stick it to the script
Prepare for battle and war, causin the enemy to abandon ship
It’s my turn to burn, the flame I desent like the sun
And catch rip with or against anyone
The heat is on, as knowledge is beein born
Creatin that electrical magnetic dorm
Consistant combagin, do you really think you can fuck with
This intelligent team of destruction
Forever buildin and destructin
Maintainin balance in our cypher
Keepin a more flammable fluid than in your lighter
Got enough energy to incite ya, excite ya
Yeah, I’m here to take ya higher to the Messiah
And get my earth wind & fire, Devil’s a lier
You best to beware of the soul buyer
Better drive the lead ya to damnation, cancelation
But every good is duck this God right creation
My get down is all in my mans for the station
Bring ya four universal greatings which be peace
Travel worldwide, leavin my mark in the east
Many fakes and frauds be gettin applauded
At least ya brain weight, that of distorted
Got my peoples reachin it when they can’t afford it
Forgetten the true factors of life
I’m bringin this drum thru my windpipe
My shit is mad tight
Shinin the true light, boastin ya adreneline
To take flight, Power Universals out of sight
Hah!

It’s a street fight!

It’s a street fight!

[D-Wyze]
Hit hydro on the saddle never lost in a battle
Movin silent with the night so all you hear is my shadow
Stayin calm while the stress factor builds in my palm
If I decide, to drop the bomb, "Yoga flame!" like Dhalsim
No time for slackin, I’m attackin like the Greenpeace
Smushin your grillpiece, until the red juices release
Servin brains with rice, spillin blood over ice
Caught you peepin my moves, like Marcia Clark
on O.J. video highlights, you better straighten up and fly right
I know fakes like gold miners know pyrite
You know the profile, first, let your competition compile
Then watch me flip out, maniac killer style
We can get down, with the forces of gravity
"Sonic boom!" like Guile, cave in your chest cavity
Ice Ice, baby too cold to hold
Got the power like Balrog to make your body explode

[E-Vocalist]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  I got the
mad crazy hard hittin kicks like Ken
Mad punches like Sway flows, the evil spits red phlegm
No more, no other shall surpass the fate
I’ve taken my destiny, it’s death by temptation
So all bow down, all many crews, all many legions
so it’s "Tiger uppercut!" that’s my main reason so ahh
Leave me alone, let The B.U.M.S. see light
I live an everyday life, but still down for the Street Fight

"Move your body like you move your hands
 and I’m sure you can move your feet" (repeat 2X)

[E-Vocalist]
AWWWWWWW!  Watch out, you mighta met your match
Out here, training’s like minimal, reflects keep you on contact
The flame bursts from deep within
Thoughts of one survivor, mad murder, meditation
Step into my arena and brothers don’t even act right
Anyhow, anyway, somehow they’re gonna Street Fight
Who’s the Grand Supreme standin in this bloodstream
You keep, a stance like Ryu, and throw fire that’s green
It’s ah, so amazing that I slam like E. Honda
E-Vo flips like Chun Li, the lightning spits like Blanka
Who’s the next opponent, I can do this all night
It’s not the money or rep, I’m just down for Street Fight

[D-Wyze]
"Ta-dak-da-ya-KICK!" on your face so make way
The mad man with the fighting instincts that bust y’all pay
Targetting pressure points, provoking stress fractures, the
Street Fighter factor crack ya necks like a chiropractor
Mad intense, sweatin blood through my pores
Combatin predators, usin my fists to settle scores
No gats in my trunk, Street Fighting’s for real
United States, China, Russia, India and Brazil

* send corrections to the typist

Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Come now say come now challenge the master
You get caught up in disaster
Blasting them between their eyes
Flesh be pulling mack hypnotized

[Verse 1]
All said and ditched with the pay dough
Po-po mo fucking mo fo-fo
And letting them fall, then leaving no thug
And let them all know that I’m not to be fucked with
So who’s the one used in benzo
Who’s the one accused, and another loosed ooh with
So bigger boy numb off the juice
So niggas beware Flesh is out of the doomster
I’m down and needed the test and the clown
Niggas around me they get down
Was housing the nigga just because he thought he must
make Flesh silly-ly kneel down
Now how many get them up quick with this feather harm
How many people can I hold
Mesmerized, then they kick my thighs
But it is my size, don’t try
I’m the wise man, I knew who,when you at the land don’t you understand
Mister mister, serving that sixth thugsta begging the nigga and the doctor
This shit you can pause if I pocket two
When I’mma playing, come and take an easy quiz
The original S.C.Ts. then they serving our enemies
So what they really wanna do
For skitting in you
When the rest of your  homeboys coming to challenge the master
You gotta totally get destroyed
And then be fucked up
Preparing a luck, but still trying to gamble
All of his life when he picking that streph in
So I blew out his camp

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Starving straight out of Cleveland
Receiving the seed that you bubble your swig
And then they get weak
The nigga now turning to buy  you
Making you deaf like a cripple now
Come now pip out the master man ah
Then they serving you
Hitting this switch like a swisha
You don’t wanna miss this section
Keepin’ you open now smokers
I say focused and now nobody expects me from do-boobing this
So po stay down after mine, again I’m doing my thing
Forget it, I’m taking control hoe
Who pull the-the A.K. killing nigga now
But then if he wants sucking fools
Po-po swoop it to do the, shoot the A.K.
Kill ‘em all, fuck ‘em all recruit umm
In the dissing, call fifth dog
But you can call me on again, letting my sawed-off
Haul up in the killing, Flesh shake to little feel, check it
In a second, put in the wreckable time
How many times man I told you
Never come try to contend with and again
The challenge the got blown up
Guns hanging around call it a showdown now
So you looking for me, I know home now
Hear them coughing telling the bitch that they found him now
You troop when I said and I leave
When I smoke on top of my lawn
Dun dun leaving in this stocker if I pull me gun

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I’m jerking crossed seas
Then come take over the border
Flesh the international player
Taking my paper chase world-wide
Get for that, choose my nigga, save it
Me now move to Los Angeles aaaaahhhhh
My jelly my bitch and they go pullin’ till I dismount
So don’t trip when I flip this song
Fifth dog nigga, nodding the don now
Speak sister, recover
Nevertheless you can troop dip rolling with Mo’ thug
And the millennium seventh sign
Chiding Bone, don’t trust me
Because they dope-farm for the land of leaves
Rebel up wasteland, wasteland none of guilt fools
Found they be live in a ditch
Flesh wants to abuse it
They die fighting for the bloody mess
Get clack-back
See not in the past to sit chief
Who’s whip for you? So die fighting
I rely on you digging assassinating
Quicker be the force they be
But the brake-light to the holy fore-head
Killing, me split the scene
Then I collect my green
Heading back-back to the spot
And leaving no trailing cop
Fuck the law, they can not stop me
No so, put them off and they coughing top-drop
You all about my business
Thought they can tag for granted
Kicking my trues, creep on it come up
People take over the planet damn it

[Chorus]

[Ty Dolla $ign]
(Dolla $ign!) She drive five hours for a nigga
just to get some long dick; no flowers from her nigga
out in Luxembourg, she came to Paris for a nigga
She want to introduce her parents to a nigga, sheeit
I just came from Milan, I had a threesome
with two white bitches, almost had a four
but the black girl didn’t even like bitches (ooh yeah!)
I let her suck the dick and passed her to my nigga (nah na-na-na-na)
Bunch of bad bitches in Geneva
Twenty bottles in the club on my Visa
Smokin’ like a Taylor at my table, uh (in my section!)
It’s Pushaz Inc., the motherfuckin’ label
And that XO, all my niggas on that dick
We sold our souls to the devil, local niggas say that
Tell ‘em to first get on my level; out in Bern in the coupe slidin’
with a bitch, ‘bout to get it poppin’

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
And she gon’ give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon’ give it up cause she know I might like it {*3X*}
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you kno-o-ow what I like, like, like, like, like

[Belly]
Dabbin’ up, dabbin’ up, I just hit the wax for breakfast
Bitches tryna leave, crib so big can’t find a exit
Chest feelin’ heavy like I 69’d with Precious - wait/weight
Chest feelin’ heavy like I’m pourin’ up in Texas
Told a bitch come over give me a perm, spit some G to ya
Don’t you tell these hoes what you learn, this is free for ya
Kush got ‘em trippin’ like Sherm, on some Smokey shit
Long dick reach deep down, in fallopian
Half Brazilian, her ass was Amazonian
Dab by the slab got you feelin’ like it’s opium
XO, bad hoes they call me Dablo Esco
Unless it’s money me no hablo
Still wish I could have you, now I wish you would leave
Got niggas payin’ your rent, you keep a trick up your sleeve
Uhh, money hidden in the walls like it’s insulation
Couple Asian bitches, call it an orientation

[Chorus]

[The Weeknd]
Baby girl, you know what I like...
Baby, you know just what I like, ohhh

I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I been gettin’ paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad bid’ness, nothin’ personal
But now the word out that we back
on some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin’ like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I’ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I’ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga makin’ money overseas
Had a few more debts, I’ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix doin’ good in these streets
Bet he poppin’ more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressin’, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow

[Verse One: 50 Cent] (Lloyd)

Bottles of champagne will have us all in this position
A grown ass man now I need an intervention
We could make tonight the night baby if you just listen
Start it out slow yeah then we could get to kissin
‘Cause all I need is, just a touch of your love, a little bit

[Outro: Polow Da Don]
Yeah, so what’s up baby? What you tryin to do?
I mean, take a chance for once in your life
You gotta do new things to get new results baby
Yeah, Zone 4, Young Lloyd, 50 Cent, let’s go
Yeah!!! GET TO THE MONEY!!!!

(Verse One)
It aint but two roads that you can take
When you doing dirt to get the money that you make
I aint going to knock you, for tryin to get your mail
But all the true gangstas is dead or in jail
See boy, you’za fool, 15 years old
Thinkin you gonna stack you up and killa bank roll
You used to have to scrape, now your krib is straight layed out
Started sellin dope cuz them Ku Klux done played out
The home boys told ya but ya didn’t learn a thing
An OG, even took ya up under his wing
He said "the dope game is like a basketball team
Everybody gotta role, we can’t all be a king"
Got some king pins, you got the little g’s
Some people sell rocks, while others move keys
You work your way up, and now you makin all the bread
But you might meet the feds or some bullets to your head
cuz it aint but two roads

(Chorus)
The game is sweet, but sometimes it’s sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You’ll end up dead, but you’ll be on death row

(Verse Two)
I gotta friend who started strugglin, hit some hard times
Never been the type to indulge in petty crimes
Anywayz I saw him, most likely you can find me
I graduated 1989 he came behind me
But when he graduated, he started getting nervous
Mama said "you gots to get a job or join the service"
He thought to himself, "should I push up on KFC
Or join the army, and be all I can never be"
Then he remembered that his partna said "holla
At me anytime you wanna make a quick dollar"
He kicked my boy down with a small lick to start with
Said that he would stop when he moved in his apartment
And get himself a ride, but yo, something happened
He started makin bank, putting freaks, and high cappin
He got to acting shife and people’s dope he started taking
Now he’s in the grave cuz he crossed that Jamaican

(Chorus)
The game is sweet, but sometimes it’s sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You’ll end up dead, but you’ll be on death row

(Bridge)
I aint but two roads, that you can take
One is the jail house, the others the grave

(Verse Three)
What ever happened to the days, when a brotha used to scrap, with hands
And when it’s over, gave eachother dap
Aint no such thang as a one on one right?
A one on one is now a gun on gun fight
Ya had to get your strap, and blast ‘em in the chest maan
Because your pride couldn’t except, the fact, that he had the best hands
Now what’s up with that? How we gonna stand?
Killin a man over a women, killin a women cuz she took your man
It’s not that, it’s some dope that’swhere our mind at
Time is runnin out, so really the bottom like is
Smokers gon’ smoke, gangstas gon’ shoot
But you can’t kill a tree by cuttin the branch, you gotz to get the root
And that be the media on TV, tryna blame the blacks for all the problems
that they see
Yo, the politicians you know we can’t trust
Cuz guess who they makin all them new laws up for
Yeah, I see you blind but you can see
I’ma tell you, just like L.V. told me
You got to cherish your old folks and kids too
Cuz you can teach the kids and old folks can teach you about the roads

(Chorus)
The game is sweet, but sometimes it’s sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You’ll end up dead, but you’ll be on death row

(Bridge)
I aint but two roads, that you can take
One is the jail house, the others the grave
No I don’t wanna see my people dying
No I don’t wanna see you crying
Things are gonna get better
We need put ourself together, yeah

Write me off the block sellin rocks like bounty
Send me up to Bruno north with the M.A.
Nineteen hour lockdown waitin for my court date
I’m not trippin I guess I’m gonna lounge around
Thinkin about my mama and my homies from the Moe-Town
I’m gonna be there so ya know I gots ta open shop
I love my homies and the record I’m about to drop
And if a fool want funk I’m teachin lessons
Never on the phone wit a ho I’m never stressin, hungh
Mama told me there’d be days like this
Thinkin about the money and the days I’d miss
It’s 12 o’clock now it’s time to go out to the yard
Watchin the SA’s and niggas tryin to act hard
Keep to myself ya know get my yokes
Walk through the yard say what’s up to my folks
Me and Celly Cel in the cuts doin curls
Fags on the grass doin ballerina twirls
I had on Filas I didn’t want to get em dirty
Guards on the top watchin wit a 30/30
Jay cats runnin around yellin and tweakin
Watchin Soul Train every single weekend
Niggas talkin shit no one down cuz they scary
Tryin to buy protection wit tres and commisaries
But you know I’m no punk so ya know I kept a weapon
If ya know I’m right for gettin shank then keep steppin
Now that I’m solo you won’t be the stew find(?)
But if you cross me nigga put your number on the line
When I get out you know I got a choice bro
Go to the set or go to the studio
I prefer studio cuz jail just ain’t me
Makin hella tapes like 4-Tay and J.T.
Rippin up the stage with the felony (felony)
The niggas checkin folders that’s what they tellin me (tellin me)
But I’m still in jail doin time waitin for my court date
Slap on the Rolex give me my tear date
I know my time is short but I really don’t know when
Niggas younger than me gettin shot straight to the pen
But I keeps my cool drinkin coffee in a noodle cup
30 days later stone lets roll it up
November twenty-somethin thank God I’m still livin
Released to my folks tomorrow is Thanksgiving
Go to my house take off the Rolex
Hug and kiss moms okay now what’s next
Meet J.T. jump in the shower
Moms when he calls tell him meet me in an hour
One hour past I think I hear the doorbell
So used to hearin keys that I really can’t tell
It’s my nigga like I figure the Bigga the Bigga Figga
So now it’s time to go
But you don’t hear me though
Jumped in the bucket and jetted to the studio (studio)

[Verse 1: Slow V]
I’ve seen the toughest niggaz shook right, in they hood life
The woof type, when they think about what Heaven looks like
At the end of the barrel I seen hearts turn narrow
The hardest niggaz around will shit in they apparel
The shit’s concrete when your heart skips a beat
And your life gets viewed before that dark deep sleep
Niggaz get scared to die, that’s the only reason
That you hear them screaming when they let the lead fly
But death is the beginning and we’re living the worst
The best is yet to come when we’re leaving this earth
Your body ain’t nothing, that’s why you leave it in dirt
It’s only your soul that matters when you leaving this turf
I wish Heaven’s everything that I picture and more
Arrive at them steps and hearing them chords
Everybody dressed in black, black clouds for a floor
Amongst legends and the rest of the people adored
There ain’t no money to there ain’t no power
Possibilities are only with the stretch of an hour
If you can think it you can do it, no need to construe it
Cause a will is just another way for you to pursue it
Black Jesus and leaders of all types
A place inhabited by races of all likes
A place better than life itself
The only place where you can earn life-less wealth

[Verse 2: Retrospect]
I see me living high without the weed, street rhyming to a beat
Sweet climate feel the breeze, never time for us to sleep
That’s a human necessity, no food entity
I choose preferably, to amuse, sooth with the melody
I’ll ask Louis Armstrong to help me with a solo
Then put it to a beat to make Pac wan to flow mo’
Jam Master Jay will do a cut for the promo
The unborn babies stay close to the grown folks
They’ll have fun, cut clouds into pieces
We live amongst stars, rock crowds through the seasons
It’s nicer when freezing, hyper when screaming
The tightest emcees will have a cipher with Jesus
This is what I envision in my after death living
Aaliyah & Biggie Smalls will join me for Thanksgiving
Comedians, some athletes, fuck vanity
We all live together happily as one family
I’ll have a jam session with Luther Vandross and Ray Charles
With me and big pun kicking straight bars
We stay raw his shit is fire
And after that we’ll have a comedy hour with Richard Prior
I don’t think I can express with rhymes
I don’t even think about the things I’ve left behind
It’s amazing, this is haven, I truly found
As I watch my son through the clouds
Life after Death

Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time
Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time
Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time

[Chorus] 2X
But is that too much to ask?
I wanna be the man who touch the cash
I sent my tape off and two months have passed
And I ain’t heard a word from y’all frontin ass
you laugh

What I wanna know was, when am I gon make records like y’all?
Better yet, when am I gon get respected like y’all?
I rap in an environment where I’m expected to fall
I send 20 demos out and never receive one call
And you got the gall to ask me, for a little bit of my paper
I’m sticking with rap like I wrote rhymes on fly-paper
While the A&R; sit back in his office space
My tape go in the trash with a big smile across his face
See, when you’re broke, you gotta do it for the love of it
Niggas ain’t gon buy your joint, they gon make a dub of it
So why would I waste my time saying I rap for y’all
After all I’m black, so it’s either rap or basketball
And I ain’t got enough skills to hit the NBA
And anyway, around my block its hard cuz too many play
But anyday now, I know I hustle women
When I get the long-awaited call from Mr. Russell Simmons
Maybe then, in my two eyes you might see a tear
When he tell me, that I’m gon do my album with Premier
Shh, don’t let me wake-up, I know I won’t get none of that
The day I do, the day you see a one-legged running back
But coming back to what I was saying before
You heard a million sob stories, but I got a million more
Used to try to make beats, stopping the bars in the tapes
But all I want is my record beside yours in the crates

[Chorus] 2X

All my peoples like, "Yo, you sound phat on the track"
But I can’t make a living off that little pat on the back
See everybody wanna rhyme, and everyone that rhyme is selfish
Intimidated... don’t wanna support nobody else shit
But when you get recorded
You think I’m gon support it?
I’ma look you dead in your face and be like, "man, I can’t afford it"
How can I have sex? Women won’t let me get a feel
Lookin at me like, "This nigga still try’na get a record deal?"
One day I be on
And I get rid of my Neon
With the same chick, picking up every single that we on
So every night, I’m calling from Carolina to Michigan
Sayin I’m givin up rap, cuz ain’t nobody listening
7 Years of Bad Luck, I been jerked with 2 deals
I better switch it up and dye my hair blonde like Dru Hill
Or dress up in a leather suit, and y’all would buy it
But I swear Kelly Price will go on a diet before I try it
I’m sick and tired, of being sick and tired, disgusted
Why don’t you give me your deal? You ain’t doin it no justice
I wanna live illustrious, but I’m living a lie
So while you’re writing raps to get paid, I’m barely getting by
I sit and try to think of future dreams, and try to make the best of nothin
My life’s about to blow, somebody must’ve pressed the button
I gotta bounce for now, what a way to end off
And plus, I got 25 more tapes to send off

[Chorus] 2X

Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time
Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time
Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time
Cuz I’m just waiting, I’m just waiting, I’m just passing time

You were great, sensational, sincere
Worth sheddin’ a tear--but that was last year
Now you’re crazy, where’s your brain at, baby?
I’ve been checkin’ you out lately
Hangin’ out with the wrong bunch
Now you flaunt in your backs and your fronts
Used to be gentle and sentimental
But now you remind me of a dope instrumental
They got ruined by a bad rap
If I was Pops, I wouldn’t have that
You’ve been jerked out, better yet burnt out
Manager best friend, she took the right route
She din’t wanna jump in the sack without knowin’ exact:
What she was doin’ was wack
Now she realizes she’s the enemy
‘Cause she didn’t give up her virginity
Now she’s flowin’ and goin’ places
While you’re still havin’ sex with new faces
Back in the days, when you was would-be-done
You were scared of love
They wanna give me a sample, my success you were doubtin’
You’re trippin’ like Roger Troutman
At first, you was a fly female to call up
Now you’re just another toss-up

chorus:
Just another toss-up
Just another toss-up
Now who’s gonna catch her?

What I’m tryin’ to get at: you don’t have to be like that
Always puttin’ on a act
Brothers are lookin’ for somethin’
You know what? You’re just a hump full of nothin’
Yeah, you got a nice shape
But your brain is the size of a grape
Behind every strong man there’s a strong woman
But you, you’re just worryin’ about comin’
Up quickly so you can brag
And pack your bags, and leave the city
Escapin’ from the ghetto, but I know without a doubt
That ain’t the way to get out
You make it bad for a lot of good females out there
Well, I guess you don’t care
You need to get some sleep and stop bein’ so cheap
And maybe you’ll find a man you can keep
And stay away from that TV if you’re the
Kind that believes everything that you see
‘Cause the soaps are hopes of another type of
Woman that you’ll never, ever be
So just calm down, change the program
Stop dancin’ so nasty on the slow jam
‘Cause when it comes to life, you don’t know what’s up
But you turn and run every time you hear "toss-up"

repeat chorus

Look at you, do you think that you’re ladylike?
You’re the type to say all men are alike
I tend to believe that’s not true
But the way you screw, I can understand your point-of-view
Your feelings have been neglected, I know it gets hectic:
You’re tired of bein’ disrespected
But what do you get when you come out of a room
Lookin’ like a wreck? A hi-five and respect?
The things you go through--and I don’t know
Who in the hell influenced you to go do
That type of work, tryin’ to flirt, gettin’ hurt
Feelin’ like dirt, leavin’ with a torn skirt
Your friends don’t care because you’re prettier
Better for them--they’re glad to get rid of ya
You’re not at all bright, you don’t see the light
You go out with ‘em the same time tomorrow night
And when you find a fella with some sense
Now you seem convinced--you think you found you a prince
And he don’t want you, he just wanna rock you
You play hard-to-get ‘cause you want him to jock you
Before you met each other, he saw freaky pictures from another brother
He knows you’re just another toss-up

It’s a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I’m fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they’ll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he’s doing the same shit that I’m doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you’re a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes’
Who can’t keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it’s only us

Chorus:

(Big Sco)
These niggas want drama?
Who the fuck these busta testing
Bout to teach em a lesson, when I get to blesson
Wit the motherfucking smith & wesson
No question let me make one suggestion
Don’t fuck around with a nigga that you can’t fuck with
Cause I buck quick what’s wrong dog?
You mad at me cause your bitch suck dick
Just duck quick cause when I let that thing off
When I break it off ring it off it’s over with
Busting nuts I’m all over the shoulder shit
You can’t fuck with a nigga y’all know this shit is on
Some popo shit but when it comes to me I don’t know no shit
You got to go bitch gotta find a big ditch for a bitch snitch
Hit the nigga with 6 in the mix
Ima fix the mother fucker cause he a big bitch
Swiftly hit the nigga with the fifty caliber
Challenger, I’m a damage ya, you a amateur
I got stamina, kill a nigga put it on camera
Fuck around I’ll have to handle ya, dismantle ya, ha
This what I do to a enemy
Split a motherfuckers head like Kennedy
Fuck y’all, don’t you know its ten of me
So don’t pretend to be no friend to me
Big guns those things are like kin to me
Simply I bust and the ones I can’t touch
Well put it like this, them bitches get fucked, my dick get sucked
Y’all can’t fuck with us
Listen you don’t wanna bang with me hang with me
Nigga, throw them things
With me Big Rosco, cool Gzus, g-pack Wiseguys
Made Men, and the Hangmen 3

I ain’t hot to them, cause I’m not with Jay and I’m not with Em
See I bop to Fox and I rock to Kim
And TS is hot but I’m not with them
I’m a New York cat and I love the South
I got a New York bop but with a West Coast bounce
Mix that with a little bit of Reid and Cham
International MIMS find me in France
London, Japan, Mulan, Sudan
I don’t need to smoke weed I’m in Amsterdam
Try to figure my figures I plead the fifth
But if you wanna get down then you gotta proceed

"Somebody tryin’ to get robbed" - Sticky Fingaz *scratching*
"It could be you, I believe"

(Verse)
I get high and then punks is hit
I want dough from the Digga, I’ma wire your shit
Cause Maseen gave me shells and a black three eighty
I roll through your block and if you clock, punk pay me
I straight jack because it pays like lotto
I know you got loot, I want the cash and the bottles
I peep the scene and then tax ‘em clean
Getting bitches for they dough at the MAC Machine
Me and Yah, all my niggas call us Two Live Crew
We hit Mickey Ds and get cars at the drive through
Fuck automatics, we wait ‘til a stick come
Get him, hit doughnuts, and when the 5-0 come, DICK ‘EM
Take them down Prince where they got no wins
Word to my Timbs, I want the amps and the rims
And fuck that, undercovers come and get snuffed black
They shootout with my click cause we be busting the fuck back
(Boom, bap, boom ahahahaha *gunshots*) Motherfuckers

"It could be you I believe" - Sticky Fingaz

(Verse)
I’m known for jacking in the Tri-State borough
Taking little niggas on sticks if they thorough
We hit fools after school for they dollars
Then hit the college and hit punks for they wallets
We want everything from dough to clothes
Hit the train, go to parks and get 5.0s
I be making them drives, with the gats by my nuts
Like put it in first, and leave your foot on the clutch
I hopped out the Jack true, double like Yakoo
Came back in a 5-0 and had my man straight gaffled
(All right, step out of the car and put your hands on the hood)

(Verse)
I had to think then evacuate
I hit a few alleys then hopped the gate
Caught the bus like damn, watch 5-0 try to hit him
And scare him to death until his mom comes get him
He’s 17 so he might not snitch
Or I’ma air his ass out little punk ass bitch
Two weeks done passed, my black ass got drunk
Nodding on the ave, off a bag of funk
Like WORD UP, I start tasting Topp roties
Opened my eyes and got rushed by the Police
(All right, we got you now, don’t make a move, we know it was you, stay down)

(Verse)
I bust one lip, tried to reach for my clip
Cause if I go back to jail I’m looking at a ten stick
I’m ready to die, cause that’s what troopin’ is all about
But they lit my ass up and I’m out (Gun shots)

"It could be you I believe" - Sticky Fingaz *scratching*

[Verse 1]
Malabar, vocal’s pop like shots from shotguns sawed
Rap’s Scratch Perry mixed with bits of Coxson Dodd
I\xc2\x96\xc2\x96brought some bars, I\xc2\x96\xc2\x96talks ‘em hard
On my walls, no plaques, just the tongues of slaughtered squads
... Don’t answer to no gods
at no temple, synogogue, No church or the mosque
just the culture’s 5 pillars, Emceein’ is my hajj
start trippin’, get maimed, they scream "strains of Jihad"
Not Master Fard Muhammad, but that bastard Chirag
And I want it all yall, them Aston’s in ya garage
To the stone studded broaches on the bras of ya broads
... Give a fuck who applauds
dog, this is real (Israel) intelligence, shades of Mossad
uh, played the odds and strayed from the Mirage
and went from an, iron fist in a velvet glove fa\xc3\xa7ade

we got coco, to keep ya nose froze)
(Oh bro! Motherfuck what you sayin
your off beat DJ, if anything he play
sound familiar, I’ll wait till Zeeb say. slay ‘em)

[Verse 2]
Squandered a few nights, got up in some new Nikes
Walk like a pimp, but talk my age, not my shoe size
Spit on crews, give ‘em weather, when they asked for news bytes
Dead a rapper’s career, hit his wake screamin’ "Who’s Live!"
.......Man I’m livin’ for this rap shit
but half of it’s slapstick and no one crafts a classic
its four finger rings, Benzes and spinner rims
cause America won’t buy it unless we pander to its ignorance
.......Cause if its filtered through intelligence
they’d have to stare square at the ivory tusked elephants
in the room, and I guess you’d be relevant
but nah, stick your ass out so your sponsorship can poke it
as I cram a phrase in this space till the page is claustrophobic
and it leaps off in angst and hope like Monster Cody wrote it
listen homey, sign over the check and run it
I ain’t the One, I’m all of Urb’s nex One Hundred!

(Oh bro! Motherfuck what you sayin
your off beat DJ, if anything he play
sound familiar, I’ll wait till Zeeb say. slay ‘em)

[Verse 3]
Brown man in a white world, live it through Black music
Scrapped my way out the crab barrel, got the scabs to prove it
Shadow my movements, I shadow box till noon hits
And splits my shadow in two and I bask in its newness
... At times the feud shifts
up against the ropes, getting’ pummeled, man I jab through it
fuck a Larry Merchant sermon homes, I move at Harry’s urging
and he’s screamin’ "Attack, kill, show ‘em your granite will"
... I don’t fit your standard bill
built from raw nerves like that man-child in the Catskills
I’m sick, they just act ill
Bunch of hypochondriac cats with a bag of bad pills
Trying to swim in talent pools with sharks, but they lack gills
. .and their whole album sounds like a gag-reel
Hog tie their steez and cook ‘em up on Cadillac grills
And chill, let the Cognac spill

[Hook]
(Chee ain’t no joke) (But he’s got no dough)
(He’s got dope flows) (Man, he’s just so so)

(Intro):
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (4X)

(Chorus):
You were My First, my last, and my only
Ever since you left I’ve been lonely
I can’t find no love in my homies
Yooouuu allwayys was true (2X)

I knew it, ever since I started see’in ya
A few body scars, a few misdemeanors
You was down when nobody else was down
Helped me stacked the pounds, kept the gat in ya blouse
I admit I used to fuck around a little bit
But I knew that you would always be my chick
You be my shit talk, and next she be in black and blue
It was true I always had to have you
I can still smell the curry shrimp and rice
You’se the only one I ever trusted with my life, shit
I’d like to break up, to make-up, to make love
Them was some of the best times that we ever was

Chorus - 2X

I remember them bitches they tried to hit your sister
Both look at you and got their ass shook up
You was crazy, I was crazier for being with you
Everybody said I shouldn’t, I didn’t listen
Stealing me outfits for birthdays and holidays
Snatchin shit up with your purse, up at Robinson-Mays
Cleanin the shells at Victoria Secret
Going diamond lovey, and sell it on weekends
You used to say never give the dick away
And if I did me and that bitch just disappear away
Brown Traps I love you like a brother
Everytime when she tired she reminds me of her
My mother, my brother I love’em to the death
No matter what they say I wouldn’t love you any less
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, no matter what they say I wouldn’t love you any less

Chorus - 2X

A hoe at 18, the 7-18
A day M. Felicish Orlean rest in peace
Part of my heart’s gold
It was me and you against the world baby but we helped our own
Some times they went wrong some times they went right
It was the petty shit the reason we fuss and fight
We was closer, than the coast of Nosetrub
Everybody thought they didn’t know us
I knew that you was be having my baby
I was scared he be broke, he grow up the same way
If it was up to me you wouldn’t have to work for shit
We can live great on the states and live mad rich
I guess God need the soldiers in heaven
Soldier you was and soldier forever, and ever

Chorus - 2X

Uh, uh come on baby
Rest in Peace boo
You know I’m out here I’m doin’ the stage you know
You still with me you know through this whole journey
You know what I’m sayin’
Remember when we used to have all the fights

Sellin’ game like a nigga used to sell coke

Number one on every ghetto radio station
A-Trell’s in the back bringin’ much funk
Throw your hands up, nigga let’s get it crunk
Independent, all about that cheddar mane

I know you niggas see me, chumped out

Fuck y’all niggas, get that bread
Cock that shit, roll that lead
Nigga want beef?  Two to the head
Call the police, that nigga dead
I roll with killas ain’t no love
All these fucked niggas, wannabe thugs
Sippin’ on Hennessey, hit that weed
Nigga talkin’ shit, nigga wanna bleed
Got that blunt?  I’ll hit that shit

Spit that fire, clack, clack, clack
Straighten up nigga, hit the back

[Lil’ Flip]
I know you like the way I murder the track
But I still be in the hood with a bird of that crack
In the burgundy ‘llac with, peanut butter guts
The fiends run up to my truck for them peanut butter cups
Yeah, I pack tools like a handyman
Without a ice cream truck I’m still a _Candyman_
Yeah, just say my name five times in the mirror
And I’ma show yo’ ass the true meanin of terror
Yeah, we cut your lights out, bring the metal pipes out
Memorial weekend, we bring the bikes out
The drop vipes out (vroom), the white Nikes out
The black strippers, plus the white dykes out
We call ‘em kissin cousins, yeah kiss your cousin
Ain’t it a shame these hoes lick dick and kiss they husband
Now that’s foul play, and baby girl
I gotta check yo’ ID, I ain’t Mike, no child’s play
I do the shit that cain’t be done
Lil’ Flip and Zab Judah, we the champions nigga
October 2nd we gon’ teach y’all a lesson (bitch)
I bet you can’t go around with the Smith & Wesson
Bitch! The champ is here
(Hot damn man fuck with your folk man)
(Stat Quo came down there boy)
(On this motherfuckin Da Bottom Part 2 for you bitch-ass niggaz, you understand me?)

[Cam’Ron]
Harlem, more than average
Niggaz selling tablets for cabbage
The habbits more lavage the savage
Inside the Land rental, y’all know what y’all ran into
Cam’s mental, broke this man’s dental
Up in Grand Central, we sell cracks for cash makes no difference
Moving coke by the shipments, cause Digga need this equiptment
I stole grams from a foes land, make sure my doughs ran
Bitch I never hold hands, time waits for no man
5-0 not fond of me, cause I’m onerary, they honor me
What the wanna see, racketeering, and laundering
Now I got the E from jake, me and Blood deceased the fake
Man you should’ve seen some bake, drive out the 318
It was no hypnosis, just a few witnesses
But they’ll mind their businesses cause they know who shit this is
Ands went ? with kis, but don’t even mind the Ds
Smoke to keep my mind at ease, but know when it’s time to squeeze
Never hurry, bullets flurry, got my own mother worried
Coming up to me with her vision blurry
She said "Cam, I know you stole for the bread
But I’m scared you’ll wear a sheet with a hole in your head"
Just hold the dough cause when I perish
You’ll be passed Mount Everest, sippin Mo on your terrace
Cause that’s how it go when you dealing with a strangler
Girls, the misters, and haters, fellons biscuits and bangers
 
[Chorus]
They got luccis, they got doozies
They got fluzzis shooting uzis
They got lawyers, and they doctors
Plus the coppers chasing robbers
For the cheese grab your heat
cause there’s trouble in the street
for the girls they all hate, for the fellas, biscuits and bangers
 
[Bloodshed]
I used to sell rocks, avoided cellblocks
Wearing shell tops, shell shocked, sells for 12 blocks
Cause niggaz bell hops yo, cause I reside inside a rough place
Not even a thug safe, fuck around y’all wind up with your mug laced
I wind up in a gun chase, victim of the drug lace
I had to plug a guy in cause he said I sold his little son base
I got the cash, ask the fiends, can’t pass up
I’m past bad luck, they mad stuck
Quick fast to blast they ass, what?
You best to come deep homes, cause Blood got the streets sown
Front and get the heat chrome, pressed up on your cheekbone
And get your beef blown, yo, you better get the troops and power
Homocide and dentists, using 12 guages for root canals and 
Your wife called cops and said yo "Blood harassed me"
I caught her in the bed with Blassie and beat her fucking ass G
Then I beat they brains in with two chains
Fuck around get you, your mom duke and your crew slain
You’re PUTANG, my right hooks leaving swollen jaws
I be toten fours, smoking raws, with no license in stolen cars
When your walk through Harlem, best be prepared for strangers
cause most of them is stranglers, cause it’s bullets, biscuits and bangers
nigga
 
[Chorus]
They got luccis, they got doozies
They got fluzzis shooting uzis
They got lawyers, and they doctors
Plus the coppers chasing robbers
For the cheese grab your heat
cause there’s trouble in the street
for the girls they all hate, for the fellas, biscuits and bangers
 
[Cam’Ron]
Now I was in the boogie down getting some ass
I got a beep from my block, had to split so I dashed
And the Killah ain’t been around the way for two days
I called my man 4-0 the green Grand from the ways
When I got to my block, if I wasn’t in shock
Then I was cause I found out my cousin got shot
They said yo "It was concerning, the germans, they came through
blazing, and burning, left Blood squirming
A line blast out, but he got his ass out
Then Capone came in the Grand and drove him to the stash house"
Now I run into the house with the tool in my hand
Tried to do in my man, fucking ruined our plan
When I get in the first, tears start to burst
Cause I see a trail of blood thinking the worst
Flowers, casket, hearse, but nah, all I seen was his left leg split
Dude Capone working on him with the First Aid kit
And they told me the scoop on this wild ass please
It was just a graze, in and out his leg
But they came through dead nasty, it was Fred Blassie
Crew shot shit up quick and then fled fastly
Now I’m thinking - over dough or dice?
Come to find out this is all about his hoeing ass wife
And niggaz always pulling guns quick over some chick
Motherfucker that’s that some dumb shit, but yo this ain’t done with
Cause lifestyle, quite foul, lord ? to my sight now
Turn them germans into ashes Harlem Night style
And that’s how it goes when you dealing with stranglers
Girls, the misters and haters, felons biscuits and bangers

* Danny Boy sings and harmonizes all verses and over the Chorus

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin perfect pictures ain’t never worked, my misery
was so deep, couldn’t sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war, to our community
So many bodies droppin it’s gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I’m steppin, keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow, ain’t never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil’ homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more, cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can’t grant it
Niggaz fightin ‘cross the whole planet, so we can never be peace

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there’ll never be peace
That’s why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there can never be peace

[Verse 2: Marvaless]
No time to rest
They stressed out
I can’t remember the days my homies was here
Now a days we live in fear
The stuggle is still here
So now who’s grabbing there strap
Who’s getting bucked wild
Representing the generation of killers
When I was a child had many dreams
Reality kept me and my homiez stressing
Trying to raise my baby girl to be the strongest
Know when I’m doing wrongest
I never had a bright day
Just drunk and smoking blunts
Getting faded
Wishing my partna made it
If it was peace
Or just decease
I know there will never be
All my tears were shed
When I lost my homie number three
It’s getting harder to see
Impossibility should we just face it
Can’t get through the pain
But still I can’t erase it
So many trials and tribulations
Things we facing
Wicked ways
Can’t see no brighter days
It’s time to chase it
Cross dreams
Cause the scene is when you never get by
That’s why I got to stay high
You’ll never know when you’ll die
My heart will never leave the ghetto
I know to rise only in peace
That’s why I say
There ain’t never going to be no peace

[2Pac]
You ain’t lying, this shit stressful
So I’m askin

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there’ll never be peace
That’s why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool there’ll never be peace

[Verse 3: Storm]
Living life lonely
But I can’t even cry
Cause visions of deception
All around me
Got my eyes full of despise
Who can I trust
Why even try
They say the world is mines
But I know that’s a lie
Living to die
Set up from birth
Steady dreaming
Wishing for better days
But all I see is demons
Close my eyes and
Reminisce of my childhood
All I felt was pain from my arrival
No memories of nothing nice
Nothing but blinded reminders of my future life
I’m freaking out
I’m getting closer to that other level
Will I be strong with game
Or just the heartless devil
I hope I’m able to find peace in me
Cause theres a Storm sixty four inches deep in me
And I try to do the right thing
But it’s the wrong thing
That seems to bring me right back
To this dirty game
There never be peace

[2Pac]
Fuck peace

[Chorus: 2Pac](x3)
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there’ll never be peace
That’s why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool there’ll never be peace

[Outro: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace
.. Shit, fuck peace!
On the strength ‘til my niggaz get a piece, we can’t have peace
How the fuck we gon’ live happy when we ain’t got nuttin (tear drops and closed caskets)
You muh’fuckers are smilin but I’m mean muggin
Why, cause I GOTTA be thuggin
It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin hood out
All us niggaz actin up, wild-ass motherfuckin adolescents
These niggaz ain’t even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood
and you at the funeral every muh’fuckin weekend
Pssh, and you muh’fuckers talkin about peace
Nigga, it ain’t no motherfuckin peace
You ain’t seen the news motherfucker You ain’t heard
Lil’ babies gettin smoked, muh’fuckers killin they whole family
Lil’ kids gettin thrown off buildings, muh’fuckers gettin abused
Peace Nigga is you out your fuckin mind
Fuck peace! We can’t never have peace
‘til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
‘Til you fuckin clean up the dirt you dropped
‘Til we get a piece, fuck peace! Westside
Deathrow, Outlaw Immortals, Thug Life baby, you know we do this shit
That was Storm, Marvaless, and Pac

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there’ll never be peace
That’s why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there’ll never be peace

Ahora los ojos
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

[Verse 1]
Its time to get lost in my music you get lost don’t confuse it
I was born for this shit so I never had to choose it
I would kill for the chance to get on you get off
I’m not sayin that I’m hard I’m just sayin you soft
The world wanna know my past if I’m real or if I’m not
Did I really play the trap have I ever dealt a rock
Is he really from the block where’s the wounds that he got
It take a man to do the shootin anyone can get shot
So fuck the fact I had to grind or the fact that I did time
I should only be defined by the fact that I can rhyme
So I really ain’t concerned if I seem street to em
Half the niggaz my niggaz like I don’t even speak to em
So I spit that fly shit becuz I’m in it to last
And you ain’t got enough style miles to be in my class
So before you cast your ballots on who’s the greatest MC
Now that Jordan done retired and LeBron’s in the league
You gon have to mention me and believe me it hurts
Its y’all that never paid attention to my previous work
But ain’t no need bitchin I done captured your attention
Its a race to the top and I will go the distance
In the south’s top label and the worlds our agenda
We give a fuck how we live just as long as you remember
Hear that hunger in my voice and that pain that I carry
But you can’t admit you feel me til I’m dead and I’m buried
That’s the worst part man cuz believe me I’m a fan
If it only is a demo well we did a million scans


Huh! Wooh! Uh!
I got my real niggaz in the house.
Some real motherfuckin men,
know what I’m sayin’?
Ain’t no hangups, ain’t no insecurities here, nigga.
What you think?
You thought I was playing games or something?

Verse 1:

I see niggaz lookin’ at me like I done beat up there momma,
but we ain’t got no beef it’s just a struggle for powa’.
See, when niggaz get together they be trippin’
eyeballin’ me just to catch my attention.
Shit is gettin’ serious, if you didn’t notice,
niggaz is bustin’ instead of comin’ from the shoulders.
I can speak for Cali, but I can’t speak for you.
You either step with your weapon or you step with your crew.
M-Mad Doggin, red eyein, it’s all the same 
chumps might as well ask what set I claim. \t(Where you from?)
Lookin’ at me as If I was a enemy, but if I’m the enemy,
you better take a look in the mirror, G.
Could it be I look like someone you know,
someone you knew,
or someone you done somethin’ too?
You better tuck in your leather for your trip
cause you never know when the night is who you might be fuckin wit’.

Chorus: Repeat 2X

Mad doggin’. Mad doggin’. Ain’t no need to be mad doggin.
Why you wanna be mad doggin me?
Why you wanna be mad doggin me?\t
Why you wanna be mad doggin me, tryin’ to start some beef,
I got the hog in me.

Verse 2:

Why you wanna be mad doggin me?
I don’t fuck with nobody, unless they fuckin’ with me.
I can be the rough type if you wanted it,
but most quit when they find out who they dealin’ wit.
I hate the type of niggaz that come to dabble
up and down shit, down to face shit.
Heinsight tryin’ to prove that they got us to pick
the wrong time, wrong place, now it’s time to get it started.
Bump that talk, if you can walk that walk
with a mouthful of salt given facial assaults.
Gary, Tom, Dick, and Mary,
nigga, you don’t scare me.
I got a homie by my side,
his name is Dirty Harry.
I don’t really wanna have to blast nobody
so don’t be starin’ at me like you plannin’ on robbin.
Now you ain’t no tough guy, no rough lie, nigga,
keep starin’ at me you be a busted eye nigga.

Chorus

Verse 3:

Now the 40 Thevz don’t be slippin’ or trippin’
or startin’ no shit when it’s time to handle business.
What happened to the love?
I think it faded out late back in the sixties.
Now, I got every single nigga out to get me,
lookin’ at me crooked eye, when the dealer could be starin’ at suicide.
I really can’t call it,
but niggaz get this when you ballin’,
and ain’t involved in it.
So, now you wanna give me evil stares,
not that I really care,
but why you wanna be mad doggin me?

Outro:

Lookin’ at me like I stole somethin’ from you.
I probably did. 
But you don’t know that.

Chorus: Repeat 5X

[ VERSE 1: The Poetess ]
Growin up as a kid I never understood the things my dad did
Like hittin my mother, me and my brother hid
In the parlor from the chaos, the cryin and the cussin
The fightin and the fussin
I used to go to bed holdin my ears tight
Filled with fear when I hear moms and pops fight
I never quite understood what the reasons were
How could he love my mother if he kept on hittin her?
I don’t know, but what I do know is this
Love hurts when it’s comin from the throw of a fist
And the list goes on from the mental to the physical
Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain’t cool
It’s bad enough we got it rough in society
Opression and poverty, no need to be fightin e-
ach other, a brother hits a sister, and he’s a bigger nigga
He ain’t nothin if he gotta hit, pick a
Innocent victim three times smaller in size
Head honcho, macho in whose eyes?
Only a fool tries abuse to utilize 
Phyisical force to control, hurt, brutalize
Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought
Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought
To the hearts of your brother or your sis
Love hurts when it’s comin from the fist

[ Def Jef ]
Now I want you to think of six women that’s close to you
And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em
What would you do?

[ VERSE 2: Def Jef ]
I wish my step pop would stop hittin on moms
She got bruises on her arm from protectin her face from harm
Bein done he looks at me and says, "What you’re seein, son
Is me disciplinin my woman
You’re gonna hate me for the rest of your life
But this is my wife"
And I’m thinkin I wanna stab him with a steak knife
Too little to interfere, I wish he would disappear
But he won’t, so I put the pillow over my ear in fear
Dreamin when I get to be a man I’ma stand up to him
If I see him hit her again I’ma do him
I encourage her to go, she says, "No
I love him, I stay"
"Mom, what you see in that idiot anyway?
He beats you and mistreats you
Daddy wouldn’t do that" 
But she said: "Your daddy did it too"
Ain’t that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for
Used, abused or even singin the blues for
He’s addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he’ll quit
If he’s the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit?
A weak later the same shit - I doubt it
I’m grown now, mommy, don’t even worry about it

(In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in)

[ VERSE 3: The Poetess ]
I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough
Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff
He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff
I tried to understand and got verbally beat down
But I thought one day he would come around
But man, oh man, was I mistaken
Nothing’s right in his life and the abuse I was takin
I was accused of things I never thought of
Good grace got no praise
But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart
With the point of steel
Killin me softly at his will
The big one came when I got the blame for
Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for
One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do’
Just waitin to let go
(Where you been all night, out hoein?)
He didn’t raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow
And that was it, the last hit, he’ll ever do
The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew
The only thing on my mind was payback, let’s say that
I’ve put an end to that madness and pray that
I can overcome what mentally dad did well
While I count the days in my padded cell

(Several women a day are killed by ah, battering)

Does he love her or does he hate her?
That’s what I’m thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator
It started with a smack
And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back
But mommy never dropped dime
Now she’s damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop’s mind?
I feel like gettin daddy done in
And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin
Man, I see the walls turnin red
I’m gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed?
In order for my mother to last
So while he’s laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass
Blow him up like a grenade
And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades
Tryin to cover the damage he did her
So when that fire’s on your ass you remember how you hit her

[ The Poetess ]
This is a special dedication for my sister Dee
and all the sisters out there that have been physically and mentally abused
I like to send a special thanks to Def Jef
And my sister Almighty
and definitely Mister Kool G. Rap
Peace from the Poetess

Down south is where I stay 
Switch 4 lanes 
Never the same 
From the Antwon to the MLK 
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang 
 
(Slim Thug) 
Now welcome to the city of game, piece and chains that swang 
Pop trunk and bang as I grip wood grain 
I’m bout that down-south city, where they show no pity 
Candy paint be lookin’ pretty, makin’ haters feel shity 
See I’ma long star balla, and a chop chop crawler 
18-year-old shot calla, and a droptop crawler 
I’m no less den da best, yes I must confess, 
And hell that sets in my chest torelive off stress 
Freshly dressed in my Guess, I gotthat Guess on my chest 
It’s 3rd coast in dadoor all the rest must wreck, 
Went from’a BMX to a GS Lex, born and raised in Houston Tex 
Where we don’t bar no plex 
NOW ..

Rocks in my wrist, gat close to hip,

Man I’m so real, man I’m so trill, 
99 I’m tryin’ to get the million dollar deal 
Nice to know that I’m tryin’ to have some diamonds in my grill 
And I’m breakin’ boys off with my freestyle skills 
Givin’ them something they can feel, man just chill 
Man what the deal with the syrup and the pill 
In the lac and cat with 18’s in da trunk 
Da Alpine thump, is screwed as we bump 
TV it stay on wood with fifth wheel in the back 
With the top down I keep it hot with defined plex up in dadash 
Wearin’ white socks and dem black Nike sandals 
We down-south nigga’s this something yall can’t handle 
Ride man I’m grippin’ so much up on da freeway 
Down-south baby switchin’ lanes up on da freeway 
Wouldn’t give a good-goddamn about the he say, she say 
Cause when u downtown you saw me you say, "Damn he paid!" 

{*Hook*} 

(Yungstar) 
Here I come, Here I come, I know you see me comin’ 
Drop my back on Antwon, pick it up on the front end 
Steady hummin’ I be stuntin’ like a bag of diamonds 
I be shinin’ I be grindin’ man wood on the vinyl 
I’m a minor, wood on the vinyl, 
Broke dem boys off cause Yungstar still a finer 
Houston’s finest artist, I’m da smartest, boys get rigormortis 
I’m crawlin’ real slow on 4’s like a tortoise, like a toad 
I’m in da mode, feel me explode, hoppin’ out my rides do’s 
Dawg gots to keep it cold, I’ma toad, I’m so throwed 
I’m complete, unique from my feet from my head to my feet,something sweet 
 
{*Hook* (with Yungstar talking)}

Baggets and Pioneer, once a year,

Break des boys off with baggets and clusters 
Round my neck, if you disrespect grab my Teck 
And leave you wet on the set I don’t expect

Another Z-Bo, Most Wanted,U.T.P. collaboration for the population
From the 305 ta the 504, My man Hot Bot pick it up

With a different positioning of the snare and a kick
Dance, nobody won’t arrest you
Unless you feel it ain’t nothin’ special
I thin it’s best you -- get started
I’m on the mic when the beat goes retarded
And it’s gettin’ dumb quite mental
To be a wallflower won’t be in
Front and rpetend to say house and rap offends you
You ain’t like that -- just begin to
Groove cause it’s contagious -- like poison ivy
So get set to sweat and step lively
Go ‘head and go off, show off
Let ya body vibrate like you’re cold with your clothes off
Come on with your bad selves guys and gals
This join is jumpin’; let’s play house

The weekends’ here I got an urge to be near
The girl of my dreams to whom I feel sincere
Pocket’s builgin’ eyes indulgin’
On curves and swerves with a sexual compulsion
More than a notion, you are the chosen
Smooth and moist ahh, no need for lotion
Love is what I wanna make you’re makin’ em break
On the dance floro shake girl shake
I can smell I can tell that ya wit it
When I make my point you’re gonna get it
Backside gyratin’ to the beat of the drum
Do the wild thing, move it up some
Sweatin’ like a Husky in the summer’s prime
Yo, we’re outta here, cause it’s time
I’m erotically aroused
The crib’s awaitin, let’s play house

Step inside, feel welcome to browse
Make yourself at house
A movie fan don’t fear or fret
I got all the new flicks on videocassette
My drive is strong
Maybe some music might turn the steam on
You like games baby, let’s pretend
We’re man and wife and the kids left for the weekend
Step to the fridge for munchies
I’ll dim the lights
After a bite we’ll get down tonight
Just lounge baby, while I rest my head
Designer sheets and waterbed
Send for this and I’ll deliver
Passion flows like a river
Let me wipe the sweat from your brows
The time is not to get this wild let’s play house

[Intro] (girl yelling)
Hey...hey
Hey...hey
Hey...hey
Hey

[Verse 1]
Who the hell is this, paging me at 4:56 in the morning
crack of dawning, now I’m yawning
Wipe the cold from my eyes
See whos this paging me, and why
Its my girl Yvonne from the hair salon
Told me she was down the club last night
Shit wasn’t seemin too right
These bitches hoppin out of Honda’s and Gallat’s 
talkin greasey out they lips as if they won’t get popped
I’m the same bitch from ninety eight
with the twenty two in the boot
Tape wrapped around the butt of the gun
Heat about as hot as the sun
Leave you tangled in my flow like a web spun
Plot on me? You askin for a casket
Your snotty-nose-ass son bout to be a bastard
I gotta have it, for fuckin those who try to fuck me
Ms. Jade, wolf in the dress
Got them things waitin never the less

[Chorus x2]
(girl yelling)
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

(Clip from Notorious B.I.G.)
Gonna be a lot of slow singin and flower bringin
if my burglar alarm starts ringin


[Verse 2]
Keisha, Tracy and Lisa in the bathroom
while Yvonne was in the stall
Play hushin, heard the door
They was talkin ‘bout how they was gonna get me
Gonna dip with the fifth or just to slip em with me
They said I was gettin too much shine how I came up
How I switched from the Lum’ to the Benz truck
How I fucked wit Lisa’s ex and I fucked up
Linked up with Timbaland but it was pure luck
They said they know where I rest at, in Nicetown
Livin home with mommy, gonna make us both lay down
Big knifes, one pound, I’m tellin y’all now
If them bitches chump, then they better bounce
Top story, Daily News, three bodies found
Family mournin over lost ones, it ain’t fair
Don’t wanna but I gotta do it like a paps mare
Keisha lockin the door to a broke Delta
soon as I seen her put the bitch in a Full Nelson
Kicked her in the back and shot her in the knee caps
Went up in the pockets while askin her where the weed at
Hopped up in the Delta, saw Tracy and Lisa
Popped they ass one by one while I was puffin Reefa
Now I’m lookin for that bitch Yvonne
Cause when them hoes was talkin it
she didn’t say shit, punk bitch
Them hookers got me goin out my mind
I’m all stressed and weed sweatin, gotta take my time
Settin me up, everybody schemin
Telephone woke me up, the whole time I was fuckin dreamin

[Intro]
Grown man music motherfucker, no lil kids shit...

[Hook: Keon Bryce]
You know just how do it
Monsterblokaz blokaz music
Gettin’ money while we make this music
Takin’ money while you outthere losin’
You know just how we do it
In the fresh new whips I’m cruisin’ 100 deep in the club we movin’
No love in the game so get outta my face

[Verse 1: The Game]
Gangsta yeah I move like that
6 tre impala fuck a maybach
Bottom line, yeah the gold d’s spinnin’
hollow points in the middle console if I’m in it
It’s compton bitch
who gon stop the nigga witta attitude
when below that at 4 5th
I’m used to this shit
If I say it I mean it
And empty out lips likeI do my old english
Fuck the police like Dre said
If I had money on a nigga head then they dead
Street is talkin’
He had always been a gangsta
As soon as my brother died it was me and a stainless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Raptile]
Mc’s come and go like the G on my sidekick
Everybody tryin’ to get beatz like I did
It’s grown music
Read from my lips
Ya’ll rappers sound like desperate housewives
They all think they got game on lock
Cuz they made a few G’s and got a chain on top
If you ain’t on my level
I won’t fight you nah
I just treat you like taxes write you off
Iff you buzzin’ I might write a song
Or just throw one line and wipe you dawg
If you stackin’ plaques and you callin’ me out
Trust me bitch
We bring the war to your house
And that’s just the way it is
Son your crew run, run, run
Your crew run, run
I just copped a property on "top ten ave"
and I’ll keep it locked till the day that I pass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beloved]
Look haters I ain’t forget you punks
You could hop in the maybach if you fit in the trunk
Brooklyn’s back chill dawg hov did that
The name beloved nigga ain’t no hoes in that
Been a G since ‘78 throw me back
No matter how I famished I was never ate with a rat
OK OK OK that’ll get you bent
Have you eatin’ baby food for weeks like (/&%$\xc2\xa7)
Niggaz is pompus
That’s why fans is gone
How you gonna brag when your biggest hit was a Barney Song
Man he’ hot he’s warm
I belong at the top
You niggaz scared you should get a dawg and call it pop...

[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Promoe]
Whether outdoors or indoors, the crowd will in-doors
My show, and end yours, that’s natural laws
I get crazy applause, they Buju like Banton
I chant down Babylon it’s the countdown.
We’re livin’ in the last couple of days
That’s why I never kick wack rhymes
‘cause there ain’t no time to waste
No time to fake, no time to chase the papes
Time to get it straight in nineteen ninety hate
That’s the number and the mindstate
The only way you fuckin’ with my style is if it’s rape
But I got the mase and the pepper spray in my purse
After the battle one of us leavin’ the hurse
I don’t care if it’s me but it’s probably gonna be you though
But I’m chillin’ like Blue Note’s played on (?)
I won’t get mad if you say you took out Promoe
I just relax and sit back and watch ya nose grow

"Suckas step up.."
"You wanna battle..""..don’t even try it"

[Hook - Promoe]
Yo, my style is off the record
But don’t turn off the record
Cause then it’s off the record
How I’ll off you in a second
My style is off the record
But don’t turn off the record
Cause than it’s off the record
Suckas!

[Verse 2 - Promoe]
If I cross you, I will diss you in a rhyme
Take it as a compliment I think you worth the ink, and the time
Who me, Promoe, with the master peal
Don’t mess with me though cause I bust rhymes and piss
And fuck with dead emcees like necrophiliacs
But I can’t dig ‘em they actin’ like maniacs
Thinkin’ that the Promoe could ever get beaten
That’s like a Danish guy gettin’ drunk in Sweden
Not very likely cause when I step on stage
I get props from smoke spots to internet homepages
See my show as a sermon on the mouth
Givin’ emcees god’s word I’m what it’s all about
It’s about this I’m in crisp on the mic
To me all y’all other clicks sound alike
So fuck you, plus your weak producer
Don’t face you, you better face Medusa
I’ll turn your weak flesh into solid stone
Spprdekrizzah rock! on the microphone
And it don’t stop it goes on and on
Like havin’ sex with Erykah Badu till the early morn’
Check it out it don’t stop
I keep on till the neighbours call the cops

[Hook - Promoe]
Cause my style’s off the record
But don’t turn off the record
Cause then it’s off the record
How I’ll off you in a second
My style’s off the record
But don’t turn off the record
Cause than it’s off the record
Check it

"You wanna battle.."
"Suckas step up.." "..don’t even try it"

[Verse 3 - Promoe]
Emcees talk a lot of shit I make ‘em eat every word of it
I’m from the Looptroop crew I bet you heard of it
And still you wanna face me
Not even the man in the mirror can
Who you? A Swedish kid tryin’ to be American
Couldn’t take me out if I was the track
You wanna battle then you better bring some caps
Cause I’m takin’ all your stash even though I’m drinkin’ back
In the soundclash on yo’ ass like a rash
Really rational lyrics
Spit like ammo from the lips of P-R-O-M-O
The mindstate, scientists ain’t figured yet
Your stock compared to mine, is niggarettes and cigarettes
You illiterate I’m educated
The university of hip-hop you never graduated
I heard some decent emcees right from the top of they heads
But I rhyme from the bottom of my heart, ‘nuff said

"Suckas step up.."
"You wanna battle..""..don’t even try it"

[Hook - Promoe] (repeated til fade)
My style is off the record
But don’t turn off the record
Cause then it’s off the record
How I’ll off you in a second

[ CHORUS ]
( *DJ Supreme One cuts up* )
(On fire)
(I heat it up)
(I’m burnin up)
(On fire)
(Burn it up)
(I’m burnin up)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Everything I write is a masterpiece
You’re gettin raped by your label like catholic priests
On a whole it’s only half the beast
Repeatin on my words like Freaky Tah did after Cheeks
If you don’t like me you don’t have to speak
I’m killin niggas with one eye open and half asleep
You uninspired, in MA and tired
What you doin I did a year before the LA riots
Made the city unbiased, now it’s shows and flyers
I claim home but play out of state like the New York Giants
Refuse to spread violence like tyrants
In third world countries, stay with trees like monkeys
Don’t be fooled by the Boston accents
We talk with wordss and we talk with actions
Not New York, Dirty South, West Coast or Midwest
Cause Boston’s where the kid rest

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Hey yo, I’m glad to be back with an allstar team
Despite the salary cap, this here’s reality rap
It gets ill, so niggas better go chill
Or come real before they get hit up like road kill
For tryin to make the mountain out a molehill
It’s like old ass rappers tryin to blow still
It’s sad to see a MC with no skill
On the mic tryin to get back that old thrill
Now that the culture faded
Try to picture the industry without bein tainted
I’m ‘bout to paint it, it’s a picture of Edo
Unadultared, never jaded when I’m faded
You hardpressed, this ain’t a popularity contest
You’ll get popped in the ‘Bury in your heart chest
So watch what you sayin and who you speakin to
My water runs deep in every crack that it’s leakin through

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Hey yo, you hesitant, it’s evident
See, I’m the bomb, you the Bush like the president
Represent Massachusetts residents
Abuse rap kids, ain’t no evidence of negligence
Ever since I use the mic to make better sense
I control the stage since the golden age
A whole part of the book, you a half a page
Cut short like half of days, rip muthafuckas half my age
Boston’s only undisputed, we aimin at each other
Who gon’ be the first to shoot it?
Love the game so much that it hurts me not to do it
We can fight for our people that’s been prosecuted
Get these trees uprooted
For me it’s ‘bout Overlooked
For you it’d be a better beat and a fresher hook
I got a second win, a fresher look
Ain’t no tellin what’s gon’ happen when the pressure cook
Now come on

[ CHORUS ]

* Slow Pain isn’t on "Down 4 What Ever release" even though the verses are the same

[Verse 1: Slow Pain / Lil’ Demon]
Gangsta lockin’
All the homies on stroll
Somos Pocos Pero Locos
On hood patrol
Brown 83 Regal
A limited edition
Ol’ Town Gangtas on the "Say What" mission
Big Q’vo to the hoods
Puttin’ it down
Big S.G.V.’s to them 213’s
310’s
And the 562’s
18 Streeters, La Puente got them heaters
All the Pico Ville homies in the Big Rivera gang
Southeast riders
We doing sick thangs
One way, no why
Keep it gangsta with a glock
Monte Flores keep it cocked, (???) body chop
I slip and slide to the eastside
Little Valley, Lincoln Heights
Gangstas for life
To my V.M.E. OG’s
True homies
East L.A. Trece
What’s up, ese
All the real homeboys
Cuffed up, stay up
And all the hoods I didn’t mention
It’s still brown love

[Chorus: Chiko Dateh]
Thank you Lord, for the clouds you made for me
This dedicated to all the homies
All my Southsiders stuck doing life
God bless your kids and your wife

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Bigg Bandit]
Lowridin’, eastsidin’, Southside the gang
Keep it crackin’ in the streets cause it ain’t gone change
PUffin’ weed, gettin’ high as we ride and die
Hit a switch on a [{*bitch*}] as we passin’ by
Rollin’ through neighborhoods cause they show us love
18’s what it kick, plus we rollin’ on dubs
We the tightest rap homies that you ever seen
Like my homie Lil’ Casper from, Evergreen
L.A., C.A. is the place I’m from
Filled with real killers, homie shake the dumb
You turn, you learn
Messin’ with us
Got you sippin’ when I’m trippin’, watch my heat gone bust
Laying laws behind bars when I’m off these streets
Playing ki’s, making G’s over gangsta beats
This ain’t gone stop ‘til we shoot the cops
We on the mission for the missile so we can reach the top

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3: Lil’ Demon]
Oh yeah
Yeah
We dippin’ through the V side
All inked up, G’ed up in the lowride
My homie Knightowl stay down for war
Who do it like us
We knockin’ out doors
This is Ol’ Town Gangstas, big R-1-3
Much love to my primos from the V-P-V
And all you other gangbangers on these southeast streets
Solo from the Rock
Speedy Jim Pound
Chavita Latin Kings keep puttin’ it down
Chato La Florencia, tattin’ it up
Chapo Ensenero, you know what’s up
Sneaks and Slim
Pomono 12th Street
Dreamer and Lazy
Halves 43
Tomy from Masuza, what’s up holmes
Bad Boy, White Fence
Stranger P. Flats
Stay street, locos, put the hoo-hoo on the map

[Chorus] - 4X

[Intro: Urthboy]
Now you know that’s not Elgusto
And it’s most definitely not the Tongue
And no one mistakin’ it for Ozi Batla right? 
My names Urthboy, now here we go

[Urthboy]
The crowd all watch and shouted the shot 
Now we off and running we out of the blocks
You’ve already put in your lot
Unable to stop like Peter, follow the leader
Leave it all out on the line 
You’ll see that faint ideas get early graves
On top of a face to save
There’s still more mistakes you’re waiting to make

[The Tongue]
You backing the bull or the matador son
I’m backing the sword, I’m backing the pen 
It’s mightier than any weapon you got
Stop
Turn it up Gus I’m ready to rock
Not
gonna misplace my bets now , no sweat now 
Put a thousand on those Elefant Traks boys to pull their best out

[Ozi Batla]
Man you got no credits left now 
Like a pokie addict you incorrectly adding up your takings
who got you shaking?
We take you to task and while the fun lasts
The bandwagon stays gagging for the favourite
when the underdog takes the vet to read you what your sayin’

[Chorus: The Tongue with Urthboy]
You backed the wrong one
Long shots stole ya thunder
You backed the wrong one
You had the rug pulled out from under
You backed the wrong one
You fall in, we all in
Hate to be the one to break it to you but you backed the wrong one

[Ozi Batla]
The sound of those drums make this field look like a cattle run
You wasted your time making those tallys of battles won
But that all comes to naught so hold that thought 
Until your nose is past the last post
Charge glasses and make it the winning toast 
Who’s having the last laugh?

[Urthboy]
Well you looking at him and you wouldn’t want him to be getting ahead
so you putting one on him 
But who are you conning?
The one just born, from the Titaninc, come up from the storm
You backed the forward, we pulled your card
Built on sand we pull it apart 
Forget your class, forget your cast
It’s how you carry your scars

[The Tongue]
It’s funny how moments are frozen in time
Vital mistakes turn to stone in your mind
They whip you across that finishing line 
And there’s always another who’s better designed
Is it luck? Is it faith? Is it skill? Is it talent?
Coordination, strength or balance?
Or none of them, or the sum of them 
Standing on giants shoulders is humbling

[Chorus]

The long shot stole your thunder
You backed the wrong one
You had the rug pulled out from under
You backed the wrong one
You fall in, we all in
It seemed certain
But when it’s said and done
You backed the wrong one

[Youngbloodz (Lil Jon)]
Ya, yeah (Yeah!) A-town it’s on again
A-town, A-town(Yeah!) A-town, yeah
Y’all know how we do round this town(What!)
Youngbloodz, Lil Jon (Okaaaaay!)

Now where they at where they, you want some
See I don’t think y’all really want none
See I’m back with a whole new clip
With a badass chick, on some brand new shit
Now put ‘em up, put ‘em up to the sky
Get buck, get drunk, get high
Shake ‘em off, ya know what to do
Take it to the floor, call out ya whole crew
Like what, knuck if ya buck
See we still don’t give a damn and I never gave a fuck
See I’m big timin’ wrists stay blindin’
With four or five freaks, and my pinky ring shinin’
I stay grindin’ and true to the streets
If you ever need to find me then you know where we can meet

[Hook]

[Sean Paul]
I build big bank and drank drank
That’s why I got a purple Sprite, and y’all aint
I ride big rims, sittin’ this tall
So when ya step down, baby girl don’t fall
Y’all niggaz know the name, they call me Sean Paul
And I ain’t got no flaws, except breakin’ the laws
Niggaz call me dope, cause I’m hard and I’m raw
Can call me that fiend, one hit’ll make ya cough
It’s always beside me, watch got diamonds
I ain’t part timin’, I’m full time grindin’
The nigga wasn’t shinin’ live nigga blindin’
I’m with niggaz with the dimes in the whips I be ridin’
And I don’t pull ‘em out, until the trunk beat
And ya can see ya movie sittin’ in the back seat
They wild on the east, they live in these streets
So I’ma keep my piece sittin’ on the front seat

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Nodd Factor, C.M.G. yeah
This for my angels man, watching over me
Where my angels at, here we go now
What where my angels at, where my angels at

[Lil’ Keke]
They tell me sky’s the limit, so I’m reaching to get it all
Talk that talk, ‘fore you walk you gotta crawl
A lifetime, for me to live my dream
I’m trying to slow down, and make it through the drama I seen
Oh yeah I’m at the church, for confession again
My days are getting cold, think I’m trapped in the wind
I wanna turn it back, but the clock keeps rolling
Trying to make it better, with the loot we holding
Fa sho man, that’s how I’m living it out
It’s a journey to the top, and I’ma ride no doubt
So I sit back, as the angels float by
Continue with my blessings from the Lord, I know why
That thugs mayn, get a special kind of love
The kind that’s sent, from the heaven up above
For real, I’m on my knees and I’m praying
This angel on my shoulder and uh, she got me saying

[Hook - 2x]
Angeeel, oooooh-ooooh
Angel, hmmm-hmm

[Lil’ Keke]
Shining and rapping, flossing and capping
My son in my life, that’s the best that happened
I stay low key, live my days as a loner
Preacher man say, the blessing around the corner
I raise up, keep my head above water
My nickels to dimes, and my dimes to quarters
A constant struggle, for my hustle to bubble
For my ends to meet, for my cash to double
Now that’s more trouble, cause I’m looking to sin
Steady asking for forgiveness, but I do it again
Let em know, that the angel always watching your back
Even when you turning blocks, trying to flip you a pack
Here we go I know I’m grown, but I do what I can
Sometimes you gotta stand up, and just be a man
For real I’m on my knees, to the Lord I’m praying
It’s a angel on my shoulder and uh, she got me saying

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil’ Keke]
The streets is watching, and the lights is dim
Will we make it out the ghetto, the chance is slim
This for all of them, who be knocking him
Nodd Factor C.M.G., play above the rim
Get your money young man, mama told me that
Don’t bite the hand that feed, mama showed me that
So I’m strolling back, to a time befo’
A seed that gotta blossom, I got time to grow
Even though I’m fighting hard, it’s a mission to rise
See the angels flying by, when I open my eyes
Now I realize, that I was made to rhyme
See the clouds from above, know it’s time to shine
So I gotta unwind, let the game unfold
It’s your life go on live it, man that’s what I was told
So I’m staying on my knees, to the Lord I’m praying
It’s a angel on my shoulder and uh, she got me saying

[Hook - 2x]

[Intro - Paul Wall - talking] (*echo*)
Come on
We back baby
Swishahouse, T.F.
Mr. Lee, P. Wall

[Chorus 1 - Paul Wall]
I got the screw tape playin in the deck, so I drive slowly (slow)
Got them swangers pokin, yeah the slab hold me (hey)
Everybody know me (know me) - 4X

Cooler than a fan (fan), money in my hand
Stashed in them brown paper bags with them rubberbands (bands)
I ain’t got to say nothin, everybody know me (know me)
Everybody know me (know me), everybody know me (know me)

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
Ballin is a habit, that money I got to have it
I’m an addict for that paper, my hustle is automatic
My presence is so Jurassic, these lames is so tragic
I’m lightin that Cali cactus, so I’m higher than an attic
I’m choppin up the block like a garbage disposal
So the boppers’ proposition an indecent proposal
I’m cool like popsicle, been grindin since I was little
On this pool pick narratin these proverbs and riddles
I’m fresh like green bananas and fly like Continental
‘Cause I stay up on my grind late night like Jimmy Kimmel
In that pomegranate slam with the roof convert
Five stars under the skirts, call it famous footwork
That Cali is active when Lil’ Keke got the trees lit
Tiltin the bumper kit, I’m flippin with the screens lit
Ridin with the Big Dogg, we +Breakin ‘Em Off+
Sippin the stuff to cure my cough, pardon me, I’m throwed off

[Chorus 2 - Paul Wall]
With the screw tape playin in the deck, so I drive slowly (slow)
Got them swangers pokin, yeah the slab hold me (hey)
Everybody know me (know me) - 4X

Cooler than a fan (fan), money in my hand
Stashed in them brown paper bags with them rubberbands (bands)
I ain’t got to say nothin, everybody know me (know me)
Everybody know me (know me), everybody know me (know me)

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
(Roll it up), smoke it up, break it up, (throw it up)
Speed it up, slow it up, cut it up, screw it up
Do it up, who involved? (who involved?)  Do it to ‘em Uncle Dogg (Uncle Dogg)
Everywhere I’ve flown and gone, been know to bounce some balls
My entourage, stay in charge, I could never camouflage (‘flage)
Doggy do it extra large (large), coppin to a lesser charge (charge)
Paul Wall your next in charge, S is hard, reppin hard
Press ‘em hard (what?), tech in core (what?), blast ‘em like Nessie Mars (what? what?)
Yes a star, I’m a bad mother (mother, mother)
I’m the only rapper known by your grandmother (mother)
And your preacher and your teacher, ain’t that a trip? (trip)
Moshi moshi acuagru ain’t that a bitch? (biatch)
That’s Japanese little homie, you should learn to mingle (mingle)
See Snoop Dogg is international and bilingual (‘lingual)
I’m in the game, got the fame and the money mayne (mayne)
And everybody know my motherfuckin name (name)

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]
Uh huh, come on
Correct me if I’m wrong but God damn I’m fly
In my famous stars and straps, no suit, no tie
I got the heavy starch crease, so I’m sharp as an ice pick
I’m swangin and bangin and holdin grain like a vice grip
I’m high as a ceiling fan, I’m flyer than Superman
I’m hot as a frying pan, ‘cause baby I’m the man
And I’m leanin like a kick stand, stackin up them grands
From T Wet to Batan, that wood grain up in my hand
Roll it up and pass it, as I cruise through traffic
Slow motion candy ocean on this antique classic
I’m superseedin my quota, out collectin these dimes
My speech slurred ‘cause I’m leanin like a half passed nine
I’m tippin down on them craigers, I’m skatin like Darren Harper
With a trunk full of speakers beatin hard like Travis Barker
The money in the stash, paid for make stack
I’m swangin till the fo’s clack, drinkin codeine extract

[Chorus 2]

The sun that didn’t shine
I’ll blame it on the wind
The sun that didn’t shine (This is one of the strongest countries in the world)
I’ll blame it on the wind (We gotta come together)
The sun that didn’t shine (In the time of this tragedy)
I’ll blame it on the wind
The sun that didn’t shine (This is real y’all)
I’ll blame it on the wind

(Verse 1: Cash)
Hey yo, just the other day
I turned on the tube
I couldn’t believe what I seen on the news
What was on the mind of these ignorant fools?
The cold blooded massacre, innocent people
All the fireworkers from Battallion Nine
The EMS unit cops lost in the line
My duty, my heart goes out, yours truly
This is like something you see in a movie
But it’s real
The pain us Americans feel
A girl worked just a few blocks from down here
She made it home safe, thank God she still here
Get on your knees, close your eyes and prayer
We over here carin’
They over there scarin’
I hope that you’re listenin’, more that you’re hearin’
Shoulda saved the price for squad’s to unite
For the Afro-American, Latino, and white
If it was all wrong, I guess now we right
There’s no time to run, now it’s time to fight
Instead of the Twin Towers we gonna build triplets
And show asperity to them evil ass snipples
It’s on

(Chorus) x2
The sun that didn’t shine
Don’t blame it on the rain
To all those that lost their lives
In our hearts you will remain

(Computa)
No way, you ain’t comin’ in here
It’s America jerk
We make you disappear
Throw your flags in the air
Salute, put your guns up, retaliation
Show the world we form as a nation
No hesitation
We bomb first
Make you eat dirt
How that taste
When you wake up with guns in your face
Now you singing the same song we sung
Too late, the bell rung
Now you can’t stop the land of the free
Home of the prophet
Never lay down for no one
Represent the warriors
We are as people
Show ‘em the flag, flash ‘em the eagle
That’s the stamp we all carry
Black, white, Puerto Rican
Son whatever it be
We all married
Send the ships and the planes in
Bomb if we must
And remember, we doing this for the lives they touched
And ruined
Families left, empty spaces
Daddy’s gone now
You motherfucker’s got balls
And we love to break them
You cowards fucked with the wrong country
You brought the smoke, now it’s time for munchies
Uh, What!

(Chorus) x2

(Cash)
How could you think murder is the will of Allah?
Jesus Christ, Jehovah
Man I gotta say nah
While I’m at it Rest In Peace Aaliyah
Dame dash, hold your head I feel your pain bay prah
Gotta, live every day like there’s no tomorrow
This terrorist attack was a hard pill to swallow
This will change our thinking for rough times to follow
Dupe

(Computa)
Just to think about the nights my neighbor lost sleep
His brother gone to a tragic defeat
It’s all about your heart now
Get your weight up
Form as a team
Be straight up
Fight for yours
Never down on your cause
Surrender
We here to twist apart the terrorists
Show ‘em who’s boss
Come here swallow this bomb
Cool off
Can’t control your own people
After we rock there’s no sequel
U.S. of A nobody’s equal

(Females singing)
Oh it hurts so bad
Your love will be right here with me
Time is also sad
I know your shedding tears with me
Keep your prayer close
To God and He
He will understand
All your hurt and suffering

Chorus X 4

[Intro/Chorus: Chanting]
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance

[Verse 1: DJ Yella]
The first child would be the most precious thing
In the mother’s life
But sometimes things just don’t seem to work the way they should
You know what I’m sayin?
It takes a scandalous bitch 
To bring a child in this world for nothin’
Yeah, nothin, callin’ the funk fuse daddy
He’s still every night trippin’
Trippin, but the little B.G. huggin’ just like a Trojan
Gettin’ his ass beat everyday behind the ?? smokin, clockhead
He barely knew his mamma, and damn sure will never know his dad

[Chorus: Chanting]
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance

[Verse 2: DJ Yella]
What’s after? - the little BGs are grown up now
Compton style, raised on the .44 yell and triple beam
Surrounded by all his homies, this is his family now
Ohh mamma! she is still trippin’
Tell her from the flow he been waitin’ to die, walkin’ dead
You know, he don’t respect your ass no more, bitch
I wonder why?
Fifteen years old, tree bird, one last deal
The Place: Compton and Long Beach
The Time: 12:00 Midnight
The Outcome: two to the head (*2 Gun Shots*)
B.G. dead

[Chorus: Chanting until fade]
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance
Never had a chance, never had a chance

[20 second instrumental to open]

[Chorus 2X: John Cena]
We roll by in the pimp ride (then we)
Walk through with the pimp slide (y’all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y’all know we serious

[John Cena]
I’ll be makin you move so quick you can’t see me in slow-mo
Get your throat cut when you step in the dojo
Y’all got no flow, we be makin hits
You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit
Yeah - you all hype like a street team
I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene
Makin beat fiends scream, they be lovin the click
Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick
Cause she know that when I’m flowin it’s hot
There’s a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot
Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again
She give me free strokes, that’s why I call her a mulligan
See me on TV, knows everything about me
You can’t fuck with me, she can’t fuck without me
And if you think she don’t be lovin my thangs
That’s like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?

[Chorus]

[Tha Trademarc]
Fuck record execs, promisin checks
I been cleanin tables now I’m seein labels, these chicks
sayin "haven’t we met," man holdin my breath
Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven’t seen yet
I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut
Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up
They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me
I got no game, it’s just some bitches understand my story
Nas said it before, that’s raw
If you leavin the club your clothes’ll end up on the car floor
Man, I got no time for words after sex
I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next
Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick’s nightmare
Even though you took me home, I won’t spend the night there
I’ve had hookers to virgins, on they back
Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs

[Chorus]

[John Cena]
Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I’m not Jay-Z
I play the field, I never let the field play me
You see my Chevy?  You know there’s ten chicks aboard
Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board
I’m stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range
Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change
She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig
She called my dick Frank White cause it’s +Notoriously B.I.G.+

"I invest indigenous interest"  (2Mex sample scratched by dj ESP)

[2Mex]
I am the Keeper of the Keys
The poise in the trees
The salt in the seas
The degrees when you freeze
The origin of disease
The power to bring the entire planet down to it’s knees
Dropping love bombs on hyperextended palms
Superimposed songs reword written wrongs
Petition repetition and redundant incumbent
The witness will witness the abundance of oneness
The ability to scream until I faint
I’m dodging the dreams, I take my fate
Looking for the long lifeline of a line
And I’m being forced to fingerprint all the fineprint
Now I’m implicated in triplicate
I’m a complicated instrument
Playing an isolated incident
With self-sedated insolence
Southern California significance

[Chorus:  sampled singing]
"Keeper of the Keys
He’s the Keeper of the Keys
It’s all so __?__"

[2Mex]
Still the Keeper of the Keys
I can’t trust any emcees
Until all of my conspiracy theories are at ease
I will wear a gasmask in the breeze
Protect originality from planetary thieves
Medical science is insanity
Every computer in the world is mad at me
‘Cause I’m not compatible
To a nonspiritual sabbatical
And as my saneness descends
And I realize that I don’t need any more friends
When time goes back to where it’s from
My skin will shed into an indigenous drum
Songodsuns, the reception is trinitron
The motivation to get up and live on
Minimalizing all the daily mistakes
Subliminally despising all the fakes
That’s why I’m RUNNING... until the end of the night
I’m LONGING... for my words to be the light
I’m DREAMING... that we will all be alright
I’m RUNNING LONG DREAMS until I ignite

So just reach, ha, come on, just a little
I put this on everything in the world that it’ll
Be the beginning of what is to be endless
‘Cause loving you is infinite and effortless

Reach, ha, come on, just a little
I put this on everything in the world that it’ll
Be the beginning of what is to be endless
‘Cause loving you is infinite and effortless

[Chorus:  sampled singing]

[Intro: Eternal Love]
Ha ha ha ha ha~!
Eternal Love, Diabolic
Third World Order, Rebel Army
It’s all mental
This is the rebels mentality - always in the zone
Ready to go hand to hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality - fight for freedom in my home
Do this for my people and the babies gettin grown
This is the rebels mentality

[Eternal Love]
Morphing necklace around my neck and tomahawks in my hands
A column sang that when I’m speakin, Korean
They give the hurt, when they’re tearin, through your skin
As if you’re a wall safe, and I’m breakin in
I’ll grab your mind and I take it, mode will spin
Take you to the end of time just to re-begin
They look at me and say that I’m walkin in sin
But I go to war so they don’t have to and I fight to win
I can see it and do it, but I can’t explain it though
I can see through the matrix and can re-arrange the code
So fuck what they doin out of Bohemian Groves
I’m like the +Full Metal+ I don’t gotta use any circles
I’m a front line general, re-arrangin the chemicals
In your city bloke givin the third a better flow
So you can open up your eyes
or we can break the oppresion on you they hold

[Chorus]
This is the rebels mentality - always in the zone
Ready to go hand to hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality - fight for freedom in my home
Do this for my people and the babies gettin grown
This is the rebels mentality - take you to a higher state
This is guerilla warfare, doing whatever it takes
This is the rebels mentality - always raisin the stakes
Cause we’re always makin moves to change this place
The rebels mentality

[Diabolic]
Fuck cops, go to war with police
And force them to eat their guns when their fortress is breached
Attackin like it’s Normady and we’re stormin the beach
Afterwards ‘Bolic’s goin for the corporate elite
Kick the door with my feet ‘til I, break it in half
Lawn mower blades spinnin for the snakes in the grass
40’s and Timbs, fuck the champagne in your glass
Son of a gun, pops told me aim and just blast
Ain’t chasing the cash and spittin vaginal raps
I just make songs based on actual facts
Tearing through your flesh, where the fuck my cannibals at~?
Slaughter sheep with the wolves in this animals pact
Attackin the track, every time I go in the booth
An inspiration when moral is gettin low in the troops
Told the recruits, I would rather choke from a noose
than accept being lied to, so I’m exposin the truth

[Chorus]

[Intro - El Da Sensei]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, what the fuck yo, here we go
El Da Sensei, 3D, A.Vee for the 2-G season
I ain’t even gon’ say it no more
I’ma just sit back and let the song just play
KnowhatImsayin, yo
Let it go, let it go, let it go..

[Verse 1 - El Da Sensei]
Never simplistic I keep it updated and complicated
My own shit for sure, not a flop or drug related
Compact with raps, beats that clap
For hard hats and backpacks who can adapt to my design of rap
Table of contents makes me wind man
Constantly on replay makin’ sure it be the Sensei
When natural, my natural renoun sounds from fans
Suitable, crucial that they become recruitable
Who should you address as your man at arms
Bent down on clowns before I bodily harm
Of a shine dime no petty crimes, so I’m
stayin’ in touch to feel again and feelin’ the dutch
First letter A and then comes the Vee
But harddrop can’t be ordered to no fuckin’ factory
Sacred 3D blends recommend my medicine prescription free
Open to all veterans
This specimen yesimen[?] wrestlin’ caps, like triple eights
My mindstate compared to tapes from here to ‘88
Classic and style, master with slick words
Give you shit you never heard straight from New Jers’

[Hook - El Da Sensei](2X)
With these words and this beat combined
You know we shine with that of the meat rack
Fuck that kind of track
Where ya at?
"New Jerusalem"
Where ya at?
Where ya at?
"Around the globe we explode across the map"

[Verse 2 - El Da Sensei]
I’m gifted with the word of speak
Mister highlight, primetime shine, granted player of the week
I mortalize my fans who got my shit in they crates
CD’s and mixtapes, posters with autographs on the case
Beats laced with the finest of rhymes, signed on vintage
Year ‘71 link shot the proper image
My fast vocab’ it stands depends
Spills upon the public eye, bringin’ the truth and no lies
Excercise my status, show and prove my craft
Lethal rhyme blast, seekin’ the top charge fast, a past
All data I mean to intervene
Lay my cards on the table flush the whole damn scene
Take a time warp trip, ‘85 to ‘86, when I first learned to burn
Chuck Chillout on the mix, through hardships
I mix the hard shit regardless
My performance be the hottest I’m down to lock shit

[Hook - El Da Sensei](4X)
With these words and this beat combined
You know we shine with that of the meat rack
Fuck that kind of track
Where ya at?
"New Jerusalem"
Where ya at?
Where ya at?
"Around the globe we explode across the map"


[Outro - scratched by DJ A.Vee & DJ 3D]
"Who’s-who’s-who’s-who’s this?"
"MC El-MC El"
"New Jerus-New Jerusalem"
"3D"
"A.Vee"

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto y crudo destino
Mi canto contigo est\xc3\xa1 (x 2)

En penumbra vive ese preciado ser
Por no poder decir, soltar su voz al viento
Tratar de resistir sin perder el aliento
Sin parar ni un momento
Siglos trabajando dando amor
A veces no re\xc3\xadr, sin lugar en el tiempo
\xc2\xbfD\xc3\xb3nde queremos ir los machos del universo?
Escribamos ya otro verso

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto y crudo destino
Mi canto contigo est\xc3\xa1 (x 2)

Hey, Macho t\xc3\xba pa’ c\xc3\xa1
Soy como un tren volao a cada lao
Como un toro sofocao

Yo, al darme cuenta y ver 
Donde han dejado tus derechos
Directo al hecho, abusos sexuales, 
Explotaci\xc3\xb3n de edades, corrupciones sociales
Criminales como marionagrajales
Est\xc3\xa1 fundida aqu\xc3\xad la historia
Pero a\xc3\xban la victoria no se ha logrado
Hay que seguir con fuerza y que todas
Lucha programada reinvindicando 
A la mujer progreso a\xc3\xban que s\xc3\xa9 que 
pa’ lograrlo hay un gran trecho, te digo de hecho
Cuando lagrimas t\xc3\xba llorabas mam\xc3\xa1 calmaba pecho

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto y crudo destino
Mi canto contigo est\xc3\xa1 (x 2)

Me resguardo en el l\xc3\xa1piz, resp\xc3\xadritu
El esp\xc3\xadritu se siente happy, nada personality 
Traza y real te hizo a t\xc3\xad mujer, creadora de razas
maltrato f\xc3\xadsico, castigo duro al que abasalla
Women don’t stop, la batalla no est\xc3\xa1 ganada
Resta mucho por andar en esta ganga
Juntos la guerra estar\xc3\xa1 triunfada
What do you want? Respect, don’t stress
Hoy por m\xc3\xad ser\xc3\xa1s premiada
It’s over, continuaremos la batalla
Toda esta mierda se acabar\xc3\xa1
Tu posici\xc3\xb3n ya respetada
A altos niveles ya est\xc3\xa1 apoyada

Mujer te canto este himno
Traigo la pura verdad
Incierto y crudo destino
Mi canto contigo est\xc3\xa1 (x 2)

Mujer te canto este himno 
Incierto y crudo destino

[Pep Love]
we ahead of the charts
man we better than smart
we going get up in this industry and tear it apart
we the hierpariants
and you rappers is fuckin’ parrots
I get ‘embarrassed
When I hear it
but still I grin and bear it
Hierogyphics is your worst nightmare
since inseption
and I know that hurt right there
but accept it
we inherit the Earth right here
in the present
ressurrecting the first idea
Full Circle

[Intro: loud booming voice that echoes]
Comp-ton.. Comp-ton.. Comp-ton

[quiet voice that whispers]
Real muthaphuckkin G’s...
Real muthaphuckkin G’s...
Real Muthaphuckkin G’s...

[Verse One: Eazy-E]
Hey yo Doctor, here’s another proper track
and it’s phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
So youse a wannabe ‘loc, and you’ll get smoked, and I hope
that your fans understand when you talk about playin me
The same records that you makin is payin me
Motherfuck Dre, Motherfuck Snoop, Motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I’m the E-A-Z-Y-E and, this is the season
to let the real motherfuckin G’s in
You’re like a kid you found a pup and now you’re dapper
But tell me where the fuck ya found a anorexic rapper?
Talkin about who you gon squabble with and who you shoot
You’re only 60 pounds when you’re wet and wearin boots
(Damn E, they tried to fade you on "Dre Day")
But "Dre Day" only make Eazy’s pay day
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the "G Thang"
But on his old album cover he was a she thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don’t step to deez
motherfuckin real G’s!

"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}
"Boy you should have known by now.."
"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}
"Boy you should have known by now.."

[Verse Two: Dresta]
Everyday it’s a new rapper, claimin to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch, but portray the role of gangsta
Ain’t broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the, nigga and you’ll capture
the fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor
who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
of niggaz in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me who’s a witness, to your fuckin work
So you never had no bi’ness, so save the drama jerk
Niggaz straight kill me, knowin that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangstas
See I did dirt, put in work, and many niggaz can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that!
But niggaz like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I’m just tired of suburbian niggaz talkin about they come from projects
Knowin, you ain’t seen the parts of the streets G
Think you started tryin to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag, tried to sag, but you’re floodin at the same, time
And your set don’t accept ya
Scared to kick it with your homies cuz you know they don’t respect ya
So nigga please, check nuts before ya step to deez
motherfuckin real G’s

[Verse Three: B.G. Knocc Out]
Welllllllll.. it’s the Knocc Out, definition orginal baby gangsta
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker I’ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin shank, if I haveta
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you’re dealin with some real motherfuckers
G’s, nigga please, don’t try to step
cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See young niggaz like me, will break ya off somthin
Claimin my city, but Dre you ain’t from Compton
Niggaz like y’all is what I call wannabeez
and ain’t shit compared to real motherfuckin G’s

"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}

[Verse Four: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G., who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now nigga it’s on
You and your Doggy Dogg, think that y’all hoggin shit
Both of you bitches, can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin up a bitch don’t make you shit, but then again
some niggaz think it makes a man
Damn it’s a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
from wearin lipstick, to smokin on chronic at pic-nics
And now you think you’re bigger
But to me you ain’t nothin but a bitch-ass nigga
that ain’t worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you’re gettin treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant’s directions
Or get your ass pumped with a Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the E’s
Stay in your place and don’t step to real motherfuckin G’s!

[repeat 5X]
"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}
"Boy you should have known by now.."
"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}
"Boy you should have known by now.."

"Yo Dre, what’s up?" {*bang*}
"Boy you should have known by now; Eazy-Duz-It"

[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino]
It’s crazy man, it’s like, for me, it’s a passing thing, you know?
It’s like, people don’t understand, I’m doin this my whole life
It’s like, fantasize all the energy, and all the hunger that I put behind this
Never gonna stopchasing my dreams, yeah

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Life can be stressful, I’m tryin to be succesful
Steady going through these things, it’s all mental
It ain’t always what it seems
By any means, I’m getting closer to my dreams
With everyday that pass, try to capture the moment and make it last
Time goin fast, low on cash without no dough in the stash
Dwellin on the future, froze on the past
Turn to these streets, basically, are the same to me
I feel them taking over me, distant from family, smoking weed
I’m getting high, my mother sick, she prays to God and cries
Keep my baby boy alive, while he’s striving to get closer to my dreams
Fresh outta luck, drinkin, drownin in grief
All by my lonesome like the trees for a leaf
I’m getting higher and higher
Heart’s on fire, pain is down deep
I can feel it in my sleep
But as long as I’m breathing, I won’t stop
I’m rock bottom till I come out on top
Stuck in my grotch, you know what
Sometimes it feels like I’m trapped that up, red light, and I’m never gonna pass green
The most awfullest thing, twenty five with no cream
Black balled, it made me wanna just scream
Sometimes it feels like I don’t see no progress ever like I’m stuck forever
Is that my fate, being stuck forever?
Feelin low like everything’s lookin up forever? No
I’m goin high, puttin work in till the day that I die
Thank you dad, it’s in my genes
Hustle hard to get closer to my dreams
I’m a man with ambition on a mission
Hit em hard, see how they handle submission
I’m going higher and higher
And ain’t shit nobody can tell me, so long as I’m spitting fire
Hitman for Hire on these beats, higher in the streets
Them low rank rappers that ???, and know these labels sleep
Sometimes you have to let it go
Timing is everything in this game, I was destined to blow
And even when that light dims, I’m possessing the glow
Blood, sweat, and tears is all I know, it helps me to grow
I’m known for good people, the morals I was raised with
Gimme the strength and determination she needed to make it
The negative people out of the cypher
Hater try to take me off my grind, I pay em no mind

[Outro: Goapele sample (JoJo Pellegrino)]
Push them all away so I can move on, closer to my dreams
(Closer to my dreams, come on) Feel it all over my being
(Fell it in my bones, I can feel it in my soul, it’s in my blood)
Close your eyes and see what you believe (Close my eyes, fantasize,
Gettin closer to my dreams, and I’m)
I’ll be higher and higher (to the top, to the top)
Oooh, unbelievable (all the way to the stars, closer to my dreams)
I get high, high (I can touch the clouds)
To my dreams, I get higher and higher (closer to my dreams)
Upward and onward and beyond all I can see (come on, yeah)
(Closer to my dreams) I’m so close it’s like I can feel my dreams
(I keep running, I keep running, yeah) High, I’m moving closer
(CLoser to my dreams) Sometimes it feels like
(Sometimes I feel like I hit nothing, it never stops)

[Coolwadda]
I thank, so if I don’t your considered slippin
Then I gots to get you even if we aint trippin
Fuck that nigga who aint Wadda try to certify
Got love for Chico anybody else we do not vibe
I think niggas try to flip the old school shit too much
I think I put there like ?? with a nice touch
I think emcees with no flavor should stop rappin
I think some sampling is cool if fools aint yappin
Man that’s it about it, I don’t wanna hear shit about it
Plus I think when this shit drops niggas gon’ get about it
Hip Hop is too crowded
And I’m on in the tip of the stage slappin hands in the front row tight
Hittin blunt rolled tight, y’all swing ‘em left to right
If ya feelin it
Don’t even talk about this verse, just say I’m killin it
What chou think about that? It’s just a thought, thought
I think flava to this whole shit is what we brought

[Chico]
See I’ve been thinkin all these bitch niggas need to quit it
And quick to speak on it niggas aint never get it
Rhyme reported Chico the Chipper put it in order
What the fuck they run? Nuttin but they bath water
Last quarter, less than ten ticks
Standin at the line can’t you feel this shit and bricks
Brickin like a busta
Cus you sour like lemon custard, don’t trust ya
Nigga shoulda been rushed off the stage
Feelin nutty then bust a gauge
Cut like spades, blowin back out like hand grenades
Ya ?? bleeding
Now you in church, four days later obituary reading
Test me, lets see am I hard like I claim to be
Stomach scarred from the gang activity
Just a memory he did and I wont get caught
Let it be known \xc2\x93fuck ‘em\xc2\x94 that’s my thought

[Defari]
The average man fragile, handle with care
On the contraire me, I’m a golden state bear
Dump a flare in the air
Two shot from the glocks
Style I got, karate chop through a concrete block
Chop the tree in the amount for the blunt
Those are what niggas smoke out of where I come from
Hit hard blinds eye blit you Bret Favre
RIP Derrick Thomas promised to work hard
And hold it down like a big hog
Cool cats run with big dogs
Blacks fall victims to the White man’s laws
Aint nuttin new under the sun
But you never heard Defari’s version of how the West was won
Two smoking mikes instead of guns
My tongue way a ton
They all want advice, you I got some
So many rap critics think they can spit it
Don’t touch a mic if you aint tight and that’s on Likwit

[Juice]
I feel great hookin up the ill state in killa Cali
I’m about to make these muthafuckas feel a valley
Parallel Kurupt and Defari lie
Without a deal, you should see the type of car I drive
With mista Chico the Chipper and Juice on the Glove beat
See this where the hip hoppers and the thugs meat
For you to drop a dope 16 joints
I’d have to lower my IQ a whole 15 points
I’m a Prozac gangsta, I sold crack thanks ta
My niggas I’m able to control whack prankstas
Exquisite, I freestyle I love it and I live it
Ask my niggas Tash and J-Ro, can I Xzibit?
I almost died on the bumpy plane ride
So now Cali Chronic well it got my brains fried
And if you muthafuckas want beef, well let my crew know
I draw four on ya like a nigga playin Uno

[Kurupt]
Posted up with the homies big Chi (What up Chico?)
Big bolla, exquisite, heat seek, dentin niggas physics
I’m Cold Iron Stone, cold and scone, the Magma Emcee
Stone Cold Gotti
Me and big Chico from the hood go back in like sugar Shawn Stacey’s
‘Llacs and cocker sacks
Golf hats and thunder domes
59th Ave. and Horseman and thunder rolls
Ya life’s a gimic (gimic) I shift and spit poetical epidemics
Missin disorder, poetically sniping in alphabetical order
Alphabetical slaughter, bomb by the quarters
Shell senda (yeah nigga)
Blair witch from senda
I’m Alexander the Great 38
Teflon Milan
Projectile, pterodactyl
Airborne swoopin over the crowd
Kurupt nigga

[Hook] (4x)
It’s wild ‘n tha west, wild ‘n tha west
Teflon blast through your vest with your chest
If you go down bang hard on the west
We could spit round see it’s wild ‘n tha west

[Coolwadda]
Uhh yeah
That’s that parralel shit right there
Nigga, all you mutha fuckas
Thought niggas was playin
Nigga, we aint playin

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Lil’ Keke]
H-Town monster, the city is where it’s at
Keep a rocket on my hip, and a storm on a hat
Hershey Texas, South Park is 8100 villians
From the tree
Through the sunny and back
Can get a minute
My chain got yellow stones, it’s green and cloverland
Still can get a ounce of that good, just cause I know the man
Birds fly south
Must be winter or somethin’
You can tell the whole world, that the Don is comin’
South west Fourth Ward, them boys be ridin’ red
Low gangstas from Dead End, to nickel in Homestead
Internationally known, the ghetto pass is still strong
Go anywhere and get a gangsta on the phone
From Houston to California
Change your gear
Rob G and Lil’ Ke’, now the cyph’ in here
Rep your city and your town
Your hood and your block
I’m from 713, that’s where I screwed and chopped
Young Don

Repeat Chorus

Who gettin’ the most change, rep for your block, mayne (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

[Rob G]
Reppin’ my block

We love it in the palace when we smokin’ off the chalice
Quiet as a mouse on the couch we sit
Fillin’ the pouch eatin’ sour patch kids

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Thirty-eight strands we through em on the table
Sampled em all one by one I was able
They all taste good, defeated to smoke
Next the two footer, I wanted to choke

First morning over seas I’m up a quarter to seven
Wakin’ up on a boat a floatin’ tokers’ heaven
I head to the future to where I got the future roller
A hash ???? with a special loader
Hey yo, roll up the chiva, the paper the comb
Insert the filter, head rush, mind blown
I call it bluff if the herb ain’t quality
I’m hunting for the dankiest buds in the country
Well I dismissed all rookies with the keyfast cookies
And I head to redlight just to get a little lookie
Hit the green house, too crowded
Just checked out the entry
Smoked so much weed I got the highest in the century

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

I’m in the mellow yellow, hello, hello
Smokin’ double purple just me an my girl
Richter shows up ready to puff
We start smokin’ snuff, don’t bluff no more skunk
The PT Bump? the last of the bunch
The dirty dirty smoke, we all passed the hump
I’m all up in my high so I played a little pinball
Gave my girl a kiss we jump like pitfall
Ding ding to another level
Higher, getting higher, we sat down at the table
Breakin’ up strands got mad amounts of herbs
Observe my headache kid i was high as a blimp kid
Now I’m Johnny Richter never say that I’m done
Smokin’ vaps all day I got that golden lung
Blunts and backs? 40 sacks ??? pipe to his bong
I even saw a po po puff a bowl from a gun

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Why does everybody keep on planting bud seeds
It’s obvious to me that it’s fulfilling some need
A plant is a power like a human is a being
Put the seed in fertile soil then continue to feed
Whoa! Sit back and watch it grow
The miracle of life is so beautiful
Don’t ever let them tell you mother nature is a bitch
Love and restrict only benefit the rich

Loaded with hash eight-teen is the winner
You get the picture I started to shiver
I’m as high as can be with my girl and weed
I’m insistology overseas stay high
John Rastafari handles my business
Licorice sticks at a flick of the wrist
Coffee Shop stop but some mocha and some crop
Amsterdam where they legalize pot
Yo Coffee Shop stop this daze my last strange
Slapped on my shades as I step into the rain
Try to regain up your ??? and refrain
Johnny Richter’s playin’ games
High as fuck ridin’ trains took a plane to the cup ??? cannabis
You know it got me so lit I forgot what song is this
I’ll never miss another year you know I wish you were here
Heinekens all day and grips of krypt with my beer

I’m on a paid vacation
Smokin’ purple silver hazin’
The back of the cad ‘82, rippin’ out the pap
The herb makes me wiser and quality taste smoked out the whole place

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Coffee Shop stop we found another strand ya’ll
Searchin’ for the dank the space cage roll
Coffee Shop stop my lungs are gettin’ lovely
Amsterdam a place called home

Yo, 504 motherfucker
Yo, ATL motherfucker
Yo, Californ’ motherfucker
Yo, Texas motherfucker
Yo, V-A motherfucker
Yo, Baltimore motherfucker

[Intro:]
(Modest)
Unassuming or moderate in the estimation of one’s abilities or achievements
(Confidence)
The felling or believe that one can rely with someone or something from trust

[Verse 1: Gavlyn]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fresh off the Euro tour killing every month from state to state
Legend here love me, no I won’t break
Try to shut me down absorbing the hate
At twenty two we booming in Paris
Never looking back, right now I cherish
Started from the bottom, honestly
Ya’ll came in the left field obviously
Speaking from the heart and luxury
Come on, would have, should have, I’m on that come on
Eating every snake, shedding lines to the fakes, we can all do grace for all the dead weights
Cuz it’s my faith to pave my way
Working to hard give a fuck what you say
I’m too happy with my life shit right in front of my eyes
It feels like destiny don’t know what’s next let me guesstimate
High contact let you stay with me
Know my word play stupidly
I tasted the waters you drowning me
Friending me what’s happening
Did they tell you how I get em

Yep that modest confidence
Yep that modest confidence
Don’t talk much let it speak for itself
Like yep that modest confidence
Yep that modest confidence
Yep that modest confidence
Shut up with my squad, and we don’t say a word like
Like yep that modest confidence
Yep that modest confidence
Yep that modest confidence, that modest confidence

They mad cuz they still here
None of them with it
I’mma cool guy like you
They mad cuz they still here
None of them with it
I’mma cool guy like you

You know what I’m sayin?
Yo, we should do a little somethin for em, you know
[ Too $hort ]
Check em
Let’s just check em
Check em real quick
[ D-Nice ]
Let’s check em, man

[ CHORUS: both ]
I know that you’re a hoe for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don’t go for that
So you better try someone else\t\t(2x)

[ VERSE 1: D-Nice ]
Now I can recall the first time I was out on tour
With my boy Too $hort, leavin everyone in awe
I met this little honey, she said, "Hi, my name is Bunny"
I never would have thought she was out for my money
Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit
Equipped with hips that’ll break your whole shit
But before that I can get a chance to knock it
The goldigger’s goldiggin in my pocket
First she tried to say that she was playin
She musta thought I was a fool cause she was sayin
"Ugh, oh D-Nice, I want you, I want you"
I wouldn’t try to trust her even if I want to
I wanted just to smack her in the face
But hittin females is just a bad mistake
I guess tryin to get your money is a hobby or a sport
Cause next she tried to kick it to my boy Too $hort

[ VERSE 2: Too $hort ]
It’s kinda funny: you want money from a pimp
(Biatch) you’re thinkin like fifty percent
I put my foot in your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game, hoe, cause I’m the best
Playin broads ain’t based on luck
You want money? I wanna fuck
And after we do all that
I’m takin my money back
Biatch, kiss my pimpin ass
Cause all the time I didn’t have this cash
You wouldn’t call, wouldn’t give me a number
I couldn’t see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record, now I got money
You wanna play Short Dog for a dummy
You’re so cool cause you think I’m rich
You know you wanna be my bitch
I’m not single, baby, not for you
Fuck a bitch, and that’s the goddamn truth
If I was you, I wouldn’t hold my breath
Cause all you money-hungry hoes might starve to death

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: D-Nice ]
Now I’m not tryin to come down too hard
If you need some money, you should go and get a job
But this one does not go out to all women
Just those who try to kick game for a livin
Cause I’m not the one to be played
So don’t step to me when you wanna get paid
Cause you’re the type of woman that survives on greed
Yo $hort, won’t you tell her what she needs
[ Too $hort ]
What you need is some type of financial support
You won’t get shit from your boy Too $hort
I don’t pay bitches and never will
I’m too busy tryin to pay my bills
I understand your reason for tryin
But I been mackin since ‘79
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
Short Dog’s in the muthafuckin house, bitch

[ CHORUS ]

* parody of "Marvin’s Room" by Drake

{*Mega Man "Wily Stage" music for 0:24*}

[Soce]
Cannisters of energy
Bosses in my old phone
I should use their weaponry
I’ve been in this level too long
The man that I would try
is always such a good guy
But I’m filled with power ups
So I’ma call him anyway, and say

[Chorus One: Soce]
Fuck that robot that you love so bad
You are old enough that you could be his dad
I say fuck that robot that you think you found
He’ll put you in danger I’ll keep you safe and sound

[Interlude One: Soce]
I’m just sayin you could do better
Why don’t you spend the night in my castle?
I’m just sayin you could do, better
I’ll call off my robots and save you the hassle

[Soce]
You’ve got a full beard
I’ve got a bald spot
We are both Doctors
Together we’d be so hot
Workin on your robot
What you doin that’s so important?
I try to take over the world it’s true
But I’d give it all to you so

[Chorus Two: Soce]
Fuck that robot that you love so bad
You are old enough that you could be his dad
He’s got a girlfriend and a trusty dog
I will treat you as much more than just a cog

[Interlude Two: Soce]
I’m just sayin you could do better
Please come over, boy don’t tease me
I’m just sayin you could do, better
I will give you a yashichi

[Soce]
I’m too shy, so I send bad guys to do my bidding
And you send Mega Man, but who are we kidding?
You know that it’s me and you - I want nuptials
We should be a couple like Cliff and Clair Huxtable
The obstacle course has rocks to the doors
You gotta, collect the bombs then you lob them with force
The Rush adaptors are the key to explore
When you’ve covered the main path and you need to see more
How ‘bout a detour? Every single time we play the same game
Mass destruction reigns, and I take the blame
I should be hoppin that you’re bigger and more mature
I can offer you riches way beyond what’s at your corner stoe
I’ve got a spaceship with chromed out rims
So much land at my disposal I don’t know where to begin
But it means nothing if you’re not with me
I’m gonna go join Megaman Legends Part 3

{*video game sound of Mega Man dying*}


This song will discuss four main parts of the brain, the cerebrum, the
cerebellum, the limbic system and the brain stem and one individual’s use or
misuse of these parts.

Verse 1:

Inside my head, or inside my brain,
is that part of me which keeps me sane,
which helps me discern between right and wrong,
and other things I’m gonna talk about in this song,
It’s time for the people to know, so now I tell ‘em,
what goes in my cerebrum and my cerebellum,
the though process that helps me get dressed,
get up and go to school, sit down and take a test,
it helps me determine if a girl is fine,
and the steps necessary to make her mine,
it tells me if something is cold or hot,
and I don’t mess it up with crack, coke, or pot,
it helps my hearing, taste, touch and sight,
and smell so that I can tell that everything’s alright,
it tells me when to get up and when to go to bed,
this is some of what goes on inside my head,
inside my head, I wonder what might happen,
if the day came and I stopped rappin’,
would I still have friends or be all alone,
do they like me for me or for the microphone,
and also, when I go on a date,
to a fancy resteraunt, a hundred dollars a plate,
and people stare, is it because they recognize me,
or are they knee-jerk reacting to what they see,
I’m sorry, let me make it somewhat clear,
do they look with joy or do they look with fear,
do they think ‘oh wow, Young MC is near’,
or do they think, ‘yo, get that nigga out of here’,
I don’t know, it’s an unfortuante case,
that I can’t read your mind when I see your face,
but on the other hand, you can’t read mine,
so I guess that the status quo’s just fine,
for instance, say I’m in a tall building,
looking out the window, what if I illed and,
jumped out, would it really matter to some,
and if they had my funeral, just who would come,
would they cry for me after I was gone,
well don’t worry, that’s not how I’m gonna move on,
cause I wanna go to heaven after I am dead,
but this is what I goes on inside my head

Chours 2: (spoken)

the cerebrum is the part of the brain which is responsible for thinking,
reasoning, problem solving, and initiating resposes to external stimuli.  It
is comprised of four lobes: the frontal, which is concerned with speach and
voluntary muscle activity, the partietal, which is concerned with the
interpetation of sensory stimuli, the temporal, which is concerned with
auditory stimuli or hearing, and the occipital lobe, which is concerned with
the interpetation of visual stimuli.  It is the development of the cerebrum
in humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures.  Only whales
and dolphins have comparable cerveal development.

Verse 2: 

Inside my head, pretty women reign supreme,
because they enter my live and dominate my dreams,
I see one walking down the avenue freely,
and I look her up and down hoping that she don’t see me,
then I wonder, what if the girl just stopped,
threw me on the ground and she got on top,
and moved and grooved until our bodies were slick,
then I stop and say ‘man, that’s sick’,
but I’m not alone in this train of thought,
alot of people think it, but they don’t get caught,
they just live their lives and keep it all inside,
another secret that the brain will hide, 
right, I wonder what it’s like to live life wild,
I wonder which women will have my child,
will I be a good parent, or will I be cold,
then I imagine I’m five years old,
I’m running down the street without a care in the world,
puberty’s later, so I don’t think about girls,
Mom and Dad will do whatever I say,
they think it’s really cute to see their son play,
responsibility is like a four letter word,
they say they told me something, I’ll say I never heard,
forget growing up, I’ll be a kid instead,
because this is what goes on inside my head,

Chours 3: (spoken)

the cerebellum is located below the octipal lobe and behind the brain stem.
It takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into
coordinated muscle movements.  Any msucualr acticity, from brute strenght to
a steady had, requires a high degree of cerebellur input.  The brain stem is
located just above the base of the skull, and is the continuious connection
between the brain and the spinal cord.  The lowest part of the brain stem or
the medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullah’s
lowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states.

Verse 3:

Inside my head, there are so many questions to answer,
and self-doubt grows in my mind like cancer,
but I make sure that my thoughts are pure,
and my self-confidence is like a cancer cure,
so someone tell me why I think I’m fat,
when none of my friends ever think like that,
and could it be I’m not as ugly as I feel,
because alot of women think I’ve got sex appeal,
and is it true, that I’m just too commercial,
not black enough cause I’m not controversial,
is it true what religious fanatics tell,
if I don’t go to your church then I’m going to hell,
and is it true, that I’m obliged to try,
to please everyone with music I supply,
and is it true, that it will make me strong,
if I sleep with a women cause she likes my song,
and is it true that I’m not a real black man,
if I fall in love with somebody who needs a tan,
and is it true that I have to try to be,
some type of superhero, cause I’m Young MC,
and is it true, that I have to watch myself,
because I think about sex more than anyone else,
and is it true, that every women is fake,
‘cause she don’t like me for me but for the money I make,
and is it true that I must be out of place,
since pop radio likes me, I’m ignoring my race,
and is it true what some people will complain,
that since I made this song I must be insane,
hell no, these are just negative thoughts,
and I just ignore them so I won’t get caught,
I let my heart lead and my brain be led,
because this is what goes on inside my head,

Chours 4: (spoken)

The limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the
brain stem and below the cerebrum.  It is concerned with emotional tone,
habitual tendencies, sexual behaviour and desires, and is closely associated
with the cerebrum.  This association provides an inhibition for the raw
emotional output of the limbic system.  It is the artist’s opinion that the
concept of self-control rests upon the cerebrum’s ability to regulate the
uninhibited emotional impulses of the limbic system.  And for me, the
struggle continuies.

[Kid Kaos]
I can’t take the highway to heaven, I’ll take the backroad to hell
If you can’t find me - I’m locked up in my brain cells
Lookin’ for the best of my thoughts
See my mind is like a plantation and my thoughts are the crop
No I can’t stop - I have to reach the epidemy
Love for those who with me, fuck those who against me
I treat each rhyme like as if it had it’s own identity
I never let any negativity get to me
I say what a believe with a little bit of confidence
Satutarious, sarcastic - ain’t it obvious?
Ain’t no need to fear though - I’m here to save hip-hop
‘Cause y’all are yesterday heroes!

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I’m representin’!*
You god damn right!

[Kid Kaos]
I’m here to kill the MC’s and knock ‘em off balance
You try to cause malice, but you really no challenge
Step up to me, I got the best weaponry
That creeps up behind you and kill unexpectedly
No time to think, my freestyles are sporadic
The best acrobatic, punchlines make contact
With your mind, break your bones on the inside
Pullin’ out every single vein one at a time
No line you have can fuck with my syntax
I bend backs, pay you to the back on contact
It’s more like a heist, the way I take your life
Never nice, to the decimal unprecise

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I’m representin’!*
You god damn right!

[Kid Kaos]
Aiyo I’m something to brag about
When I’m finished with a freestyle battle I have to drag ‘em out
Oh I thought you know bro
Me and my M-P-C always get the award for best duo
Vintage Imperial nobody above it
You hate the way I love it - but fuck it
Everybody in my city needs to form alliance
So we can let the whole world know we drop science
Or L sumthin’ and get crazy
Buckwild and start replacin’ MC’s like the girls of Destiny’s Child
Been a long time since I’ve actually seen daylight
Sit myself in a low lit room and write

[Chorus]
*When I be on the mic*, *I’m representin’!*
You god damn right!

(Intro by Celph Titled)
It’s the collapse of the earth as you know it. Holdin’ it down, Celph Titled 
in the same brigade with the universal Walkmen. Start the countdown...

[Celph Titled]
Recommendation, hold somethin’ heavy, prepare for combat
Translation: Atomik niggas constantly stay blazin’
Every syllable spit is accurate, holdin’ down the immaculate position
I call the shots, perform executive incisions
Speak to my own outside of language barriers for my brethren
The veteran who caught a piece of shrapnel from the Tower of Babel
Praise God, respect is due, while I’m infectin’ you
Never spit rhymes in a cipher, I siphon blood from ya veins
With the straw the broke the camel’s back, disrespect?
Never that, off the map, chrome nine design specialist
Leave deceased niggas with walkmans in their coffin blastin’ my shit
Infinite longevity, reconstruct my structure with dyslexic lepersey
Malevolant ministries revealin’ false prophecies, retrieved my past life
They called me Yahweh, slit the throat of Leviathan, slain sideways
Now I just made you a star, enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame
No room for garbage fake five-percent MCs in this real terrain
Drop your album on TDK, listen closely what our CD say
You couldn’t put out one record if it was your life you had to pay
I’m feelin’ this joint, I hope you niggas is to
Beef with one man in my crew therefore we strike back with the 7-S platoon
(Uh-huh...)

[Tino Vega]
The Spanish Prince, my mind’s convinced, dent all intelligence
Those who breathe, freeze at the sight of elegance
Cause static jolts similar to lightning bolts
Slash clans of devilish cults, catch boostive energy (energize!)
Deadly antidotes inflict a fatal remedy
Walkmen triangulate to form a spiritual entity (are you feelin’ me?)
Nigga, my rugged data will cause your mind structure to shatter
Memory banks has been erased, Celph, Storm and the Soldier
All up in ya face, leavin’ glowing footmarks throughout the underground
No room for feeble minds and shook hearts
Start the countdown, soldiers in the killing fields
I hold up my shield to block immortal curses
Spittin’ verses, peep my verbal slang analogy
To a dragon spittin’ flames, while the others are being bothered
By hungry pitbulls that drool when they look at you
The 7th Squadron droppin’ toxins in the place of oxygen, what!

[Storm Trupa]
Nova watchin’ over your shoulder, roamin’ through an open folder
Slippin’ through a paradox, mental coma
Eternal Nightol, impact from a rhymin’ wreckin’ ball
One on one street compete, complete
Composition, physique physician, fight with might
Strike precise with my device
I ignite my vocal tenacity, define mankind
Flux capacitate linear time, enigma, snake slither
Extension across the Nile River, bless myself
The Ark Angel - my fingers make contemporary poetry
Historical, biographical oracle
Open memories like new vicinities
Fuck those who oppose me, I throw heat ferociously
Cleverly expose the life that you live to the Walkmen
Nomadic men, commit mad sin
In the Vatican upon the day of Armageddon
Tai Chi master, absorbin’ the powers from the Seven
Tectonic tremblin’ witnessin’ the wrath that you’re facin’
Atomik devastation - strategically
Organize elevation, the dynasy, mathematically
Strong minds combine to redesign the fabric of time
On some enormous shit, now watch the clock tick

    * the sound of an old clock ticking *

[Chorus - Range Da Messenger]
Seen some good times, and some bad times
With the joys and the pains, helps the sun when it rains
And I learn to be a man, if I’m ever down again
I’m a - fight until I win (female voice)

[Verse One \xc2\x96 Wordsworth]
Sunshine and rain
Usually when it rains, and it’s one time to blame 
The young die for change
And their bloodline and vain
Crips and Blood signs for games
New York pose, and Chicago sometimes the same
We live, with more than two or three in the crib
Forget the kids, women spend more money on wigs
Baby daddies only need them for the money that’s his
Had to re-up so he really got no money to give
Fathers and sons, never get the bond as a male
Only thing they got in common is a bond for a bail
Somehow we find humor from
All the club fights and court dates
Family members dying from a tumor that they court late
Police patrolling and rolling with loaded up chambers without reason 
Haven us freezing poles, hold and detain us
In this concrete jungle, they hoping to tame us
It’s sorta, chocking a stranger for an open container

[Chorus] 

[Verse Two \xc2\x96 Wordsworth]
Nah, I can’t quite yet
I remember me and wifey living in New Jersey on our own getting wig checks
Jobs taking piss test
Down to one Pamper
Baying Juicy juice, in the fridge milk with one sip left
Laying on futons
Cold night making heat, rubbing my two palms
Cutting out coupons 
Home with a new born
On the stove soup warm
They saying style from Canaws, fake Louis Vuitton
Later got my group on
Toured international
That’s what you got to do, when labels ain’t backing you
Residents with drama, wars on the avenue
With President Obama touring the capital now
Some addicted some smoke with syringes and stick it
Mix is with liquid unstable, unable to kick it
No way to resist it, for money no age is restricted
Been to the bottom, got a problem I’m able to fix it

[Chorus]

[Movie Samples]
This guys methodical his acting and worse of all his patience

He’s a nut job (have you lost your fucking mind)

Do they look like psychos? Is that what they look like? Psychos?
I dont give a fuck how crazy they are

Because we kill... Everything we see

Its alive its alive its alive!

[Deeko]
Sitting casual deeming what other rappers do
Deek is a rapper Deeko could out rap your crew
I dont snort lines I write them with all the time in the world
Go ahead find someone you can confide in
Bringing earth wind and fire into the lighting
Showing the whole world the definition of frightening
Bats cutting your neck with sharp teeth biting
Welcome to my torture chamber are you excited
Where guns busters and bloodsuckers are all invited
Your blood rushes we start ruckus’s it is violent
Sitting watching people expire as a light a blunt
You know what they say, Gotta watch the quiet ones
So when I find your tongue I make you swallow it
Drain the blood from your forearm before I bottle it
I make you sing louder than Rick James bitch
As I apply pressure and tear out your rib cage bitch
Could give you a face lift without using a scalpel
Pull your upper lip over your head I am a psycho
Your life is final when I’m beside you know the knife will
Make your body half and half like an albino
Wondering where to start first cut should be the deepest
Treat your body like a Chino XL album and leak it
You must believe it I am a sworn heven a born demon
Who performs evil upon people who seek it
I want Sadam to sell me bomb so a’l attach it to your arm 
And watch your particles splatter across the ceiling
So how you feeling whats your judgment are you ready to leave
Sure but not before your dead from disease
I take the sword towards your neck put your head on your knees
Only did that cause you said someone was better than me
Want to get rid of all the ignorant illiterate idiots
I’m tried of all this hating this shit is getting ridiculous
You raise up off the ground and I’m coming back with a bigger fist
Shitty rappers stay underground like where Biggie is
No disrespect Big but am the next kid
That will speak out through his bars without getting arrested
Slit a mothers stomach leaving the womb to become infected
She gave birth to a sick son of a bitch that’s some ill shit

(*talking*)
Better watch what you do, 2001
Keep your eyes open ha, better watch what you do
R.I.P. to my partna Screw, E.S.G. I’m putting it down
Watch what you do ha, Texas-Cali connection
Feel that Poetic, watch what you do

[E.S.G.]
Now E.S.G. spitting game, and do my thang for figgas
Down South living legend, now rewind the picture
Now think back, ‘fore everybody use to drank that
Red Sprite late night, we making bank at
Screw’s house, and the drank got me yawning
Still pouring cups, it’s three in the morning
Ask the Lord, why another G gone
Instead of seeing chrome, I’m seeing headstones
With my partna name on it, fuck the ice and hoes
When someone dies, it make you love life mo’
Wish you was here Screw, we’d make them holla again
We’d probably ride blue, in your Impala again
Stack dollas again, and pop our collas again
Who put the tap-tap on the map, gotta be him
I push the throttle again, cause E.S.G. won’t quit
Man I put that on Screw, and the Screwed Up Click cause uh

[Hook]
Better watch what you do, cause it could fall on you
If you balling fool, better watch what you do
I miss-I miss-I miss you Screw, and I felt your pain
You know the click won’t forget, we gon rep the name
And I felt your pain, you know the click
Won’t forget, we gon rep the name

[E.S.G.]
Send me first mayn, and I can’t lose the game
New players new coaches, but the rules the same
Who’s to blame, when they scandalized your name
Can you analyze game, and survive the flame
The rain fall you ball, you might crash
Hit your breaks fast, cause there’s snakes in the grass
When you get cash, everybody try to call
I’m your long lost cousin, from Alaska dog
Hell naw I peep y’all, real quick
Watch who you hang with, and watch your own click
Cause a broke down dog, with no bone or happy home
Will run in your shit, and sit on your chrome
Since Screw gone the Lord, is trying to tell us something
Slow down playa, but we keep on running
Too fast, to pay attention to thangs ahead
Keep the family fed, and God bless the dead cause uh

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
From Fat Pat, Big Steve, Mr. Sweets to Screw
They did shocked us, like Pac and B.I.G. did you
Now that’s true, cause Screw wasn’t just a DJ
He gave me, Big Moe and Lil’ Ke our first play
Everyday all day, we was spitting on breaks
Freestyling on Gray Tapes, while we sitting on crates
How many stars did he make, by slowing music down
Playa look around, how many do it now
It’s a household name, it’s a household thang
And the Screwed Up Click, we a household gang
So whoa mayn, a thoed thang put it together
The click I roll with, drop hits forever
Been through so much, it could only get better
Two tone truck, dubbed up matching leather
E.S.G. and Poetic, we got it together
Texas-Cali connection, we bout cheddar

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Said I felt your pain, you know the click
Won’t forget, we gon rep the name
So rest in peace Screw, what you gon do
Rest in peace Screw, you know it’s all on you ha
E.S.G. and Poetic

Crackin’ white and blue bags, about to cop the new Jag
Off the lot or on the spot, I rap for Ju-maicans

[Timbo King]
Shoot a fair one, you need help shoot a flare gun, blap blap blap blap
Emergency, my team emerge with me
I got the game on DVD, so watch me now
The sharper the metal the deeper the wound
‘Bout to pop somebody’s balloon up in this room
Puncture, internal bleedin’, let the horror begin
End of the world is near, men followin’ sin

[Terra Tory]
Terra Tory shatter your dreams as bad as it seems
The only thing that matters is that the cabbage is green
Splatter your team, Jack of all trades in the shadow of Kings
Snakes in the grass rattle for schemes, all out battle for CREAM
Everybody seekin’ national gleem
Actual facts is seen to spray stats on screens
Beat competition by a wide percentage
Create more rackets than tennis
This rap menace attack the track ‘til it’s finished

Chorus x2

Oh, easy ox, this is gangsta girl talk
Money long and strong and I’m a pimp, see it in my walk
These niggas get more than bitches, expect that
BSin’ and half-steppin’, how I’m ‘posed to respect that
Naw, easily could get gone, lucky Jade is much harm
Ya’ll pissin’ over the beats, I’m shittin’ on ya front lawn
You want it, it could be on, fuck the piano’s and horns
Take it back ‘round the time Eddie Murphy was "Raw"
The hood was happy and poor, now we poor and pissed
No Belve’ no Cris, rap music, son of a bitch

(Woman singing chorus x2)
It just don’t get much better (Whoo-ooo)
You can’t get enough of this (Whoo)

(Verse 2 - Lady Luck)
Ms. Jade holla at me...
Yo I ain’t in to rappin’ funny, click clack crackin’ dummies
Have ‘em wrapped like mummies, wait til the tires get dunny
Baby the pussy’s free but my time costs money
Chain hang, look like I got Alaska on me
Me and the homie Ms. Jade, switch lanes, spit game
Cocksucka, we Thelma and Louise, with hammers to squeeze
Huh, mami came to thug it, spits piss colored
Escada jeans in the Gucci, fuck it (Let’s go)
I live it for real, spit steel grippin’ the wheel
I cut ya grill, ‘til you look like Seal
Holla at me, when them 380’s buck, even old ladies duck
Dubs on the truck, by the way my name is Luck

(Woman singing chorus x2)
It just don’t get much better (Whoo-ooo)
You can’t get enough of this (Whoo)

[Verse 3 - Ms. Jade + (Lady Luck)]
(Yo, yo, yo, it just don’t get no better, no hotter)
(No momma can touch, fuck with Jade, and)
It just don’t get no sicker, no bigger
Best meets best mothafucka, who would figure
(Yo sista pass the liquor) Or pass me the Swisha
And roll up a fat one, (I’m still high off the last one)
These rap bitches do not know who they dealin’ wit
(I’ll pimp-back-slap ‘em, get ‘em hoes that spit)
We too sick, this is how it’s ‘posed to be done
Them misses got too prissy, cocked, thinkin’ you fuckin’ wit Luck
(You fuckin’ wit Jade, then the Uzi will spray)
(Right through ya prostate, turn projects into the world trade)
I am a major shit talker, back it up, come and test
(I’ma quick sparker and leave a hole in ya chest)
Luck is you still with me, (From Jersey, and Philly)
Zippin’ down the turnpike, tricks right, burn right
Def Jam, Beat Club, pretty bitches, we thugs
Play tough then we dump three in ya mug, uh

(Woman singing chorus x4)
It just don’t get much better (Whoo-ooo)
You can’t get enough of this (Whoo)

[Outro - Ms. Jade + (Lady Luck)]
Turn it up (Turn it up)
Rock wit it (Rock wit it)
Rewind it back (Rewind it back)
I like that (I like that)
Ms. Jade (Lady Luck)
Ms. Jade (Lady Luck)
Uh uh hahaha

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Did so much dirt in my lifetime
My lifetime
Lord ya’ been hugging me a long time
Keeping your boy alive
At times, Lord folk’s been done died
Father I
No, first Father why
Cause I’ve chosen to feel this light
I could never walk in the shoes of the dude 2Pac
All I can do is give it all I got
And all I got
Is a whole bunch a why I’m not
Why I ain’t got
What I feel I should a got
When I first got what I got
When I got out and went up top
And signed my name on the left of the dot
Walked out feeling we ain’t got no more problems, Ma
Cause your baby boy gotcha
And I did a lot a things to mama
Brought a lot a pain to mama
But, I was always honest
I’m a go get it and give her half of it
But she ain’t want it
Cause she knew where it came from
But, some days I ain’t even have spit to swallow
Thought I had to go and sell me some bottles
Not cocaine bottles
Pepsi Cola bottles
Back then they gave ya’ ten cent for a bottle
And this old man had a backyard full of them bottles
But in my heart, I knew it was wrong

[Hook]
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
From the bottom to the top
He’s here now
To shut shit down
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see me no way no how

(Same eyez on me)

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I know what had to be done
So do me a favor
And let thy will be done
And let me lone’
And let me zone while I’m zoning
If I don’t know ya’
Don’t wanna
Less folks I know
Less folks calling my number
Worrying me to death for money
It’s always something
Rent, light bill, car notes or something
Motherfuckers always gonna be motherfuckers
I love em’ though I suppose
But then again I don’t
Fuck em’
If it ain’t children or old folks
Then I don’t owe folks
Cause I wasn’t put here to support ya’
To have one a your grown ass
Must get grown ass
Who was there when Petey was broke
Don’t get choked
And don’t look surprised
Motherfucker it was only six years ago

[Hook]
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
From the bottom to the top
He’s here now
To shut shit down
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see
Y’all can’t see
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see
Y’all can’t see

Y’all can’t see me no way no how
From the bottom to the top
He’s here now
To shut shit down
Y’all can’t see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y’all can’t see me no way no how

[Sample]
Let’s review!

[Verse One: Jean Grae]
Huh! Back here at square one, like I just did the home base run
Without winnin any bases though, all basic reasonin, out the window
Ron Browz shit, Erick Sermon style
Like I got kicked off a cloud Method Man ninety five
Rap references because you get them all
You even get that I should have said it was ninety four (Ninety Three)
Hard place when you wanna still rock to it
Even in my glass house steady throwin rocks to it
Oh! I never stopped feelin the love for ya
I just stopped bein the one for ya
I think.....too much
Overanalyzin everything, sucks
I’m over over dramatizin everything but
You never on the level I’m on unless were cuttin
Lustin we never argued when thrustin
But then, after all they just turn to dust 
Brother swear I never love another if this really worked out
But this is just like watchin fitness informercials from the couch
Ouch! I know, your lazy
You see he’s scared to pick a partner that’s crazy
Much less, work less, purpose less from a to z
‘Cause I’m a alpha, bet it’s hard to stay with me
Heart computations dude still occur though
You and me some Merlou, situation blurred so
Much I be thinkin that the shit could actually work again
It’s even nice to have you back in my world as my friend
Hey! Sometimes I gotta say it’s simply
Why? ‘Cause sometimes things is simple
We make it complicated for the win B
‘Cause otherwise we just be face with all the in words
Inner child, inner space, inner monologue
We exchange intercourse without a dialog
Introduce intimate ways to turn our fire off
To thinkin us succeed with sparks, light, higher, moth
Heh! Heh! I still adore you
You adore me theoretically
So now I got to shut the door on you
So I can found out who was next for me

[Bridge: Sample]
Repeat after me!

[Chorus: Jean Grae]
You and me and everyone we know
(That’s) You and me and everyone we know
(That’s) You and me and everyone we know
(That’s) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(That’s) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(That’s) You and me and everyone we know
(Sing along with it) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(Ok) You and me and everyone we know
(You Know) You and me and everyone we know
(Ah) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know

[Outro: Jean Grae]
‘Cause you know, your not gonna find what your lookin for, stay searchin.......
It’s you and me and everyone we know, you and me and everyone we know
It’s you and me, everyone we know, uh huh
You and me and everyone we know, it’s you and me and everyone we knooooow!
Hey! You, me, everyone we know, you and me and everyone we know

[Verse One: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
I’ve been knee deep in trouble, trying to stay afloat 
Pressure, pressure, noose ‘round the throat
Quick storm comin, you better stay indoors
Secrets, secrets, buried in the floor
Oh baby wants a new life, that’s what she might get
Pressure, pressure, a noose ‘round my neck
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn, to love you

[Verse Two: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
There\xc2\x92s a riot in the town, a wolf at the door
Pressure, pressure, poison at the core
Quick storm coming, God save the queen
...Wake up from your dream
There’s a riot in the town, smoke in your lungs
Pressure, pressure, blocking out the sun
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]

[Rap Verse: Mr. MFN eXquire]
My life flash before my eyes, it’s like a sequence in a dream
I died to darkness and got swallowed and devoured by a big white light 
It smothered me, staring at my face while they covered me
My soul left my body, now I’m hovering, over me
Thinkin ‘bout my wrongs, my rights, my ups, my downs, my left, my right
Decisions that I made and games I played, wish I could played them twice
An angel came, took me by my hand to the pearly gates
and placed me on the scale, where they weigh your soul for hell
Suddenly I fell rapidly, the heat of fire, smellin brimstone
As demons dance surrounding molten lava
Ghouls and goblins, waitin for my soul to drop 
But the moment I was s’posed to hit the ground is when I got up
Damn, bad dream... {*exhales*}

[Chorus]

[Intro - Man - talking]
"Somebody told me, that the, I’m the truth
Don’t worry about it, get down with me and ah
We’ll set you free ..."

(Hit it!)

[Break - Brother Ali - talking]
Yeah, yeah
Gone in a swing like that right there
Yeah, ah

(I want everybody to jump out their seats
And start clappin your hands)

[Verse 1 - Brother Ali]
Rhymesayer Entertain, try to name a better team
Reveal your jealous aim, some things’ll never change
Best twang your family together mayne
Them people cellophane, allowin their mother name
I’m invincible, walk with my word and my balls and my principles
Like a true prince should do
Only givin you a little bitty glimpse of truth
As I live it through, imagine what I’m fittin to do
I ain’t that hit it and quit it dude
Live it for that minute, then split and I’m here to get residual
Pedal hard and settle not for even a notch
Between the premium spot, cream of the crop
Believe it or not, I’m over every line like one
Life changin moment at a time
Please trust you’ll find, no better design
I’m so justified, I’m boast of epic kind
Nose to the grind stone, wait, no never mind
I could tell you ‘til I’m blue in the face, the end of time
If you was ever gon’ bear witness to the child
Then your ass probably would’ve been admitted by now

[Chorus - Brother Ali]
So now, ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali

Ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that’s just our nature, none strong as we, ha

[Verse 2 - Slug]
Call me Slug, that’s it, don’t need no acronyms
Tryin to keep the masochist tucked inside the pacificist
But God it’s gettin hard to give ‘em passes when
They act as if they came up on the south side of Nazareth
Can’t imagine this, it’s like a beauty pageant
Where them models project and serve the law of averageness
Coat hanger on the mic, rappin mannequins
Stash ‘em out behind the garage, where the trash be in
Don’t go and get mad, I ain’t your daddy kid
And you not Ant, so why you tryin to sample this?
So pop your little titties out, ego expandin
Them shenanigans’ll catch a free ride up in that ambulance
Can’t fix them damages with bandages
Another midlife crisis, tryin to brag on all the ass you get
Cash it in and take a look at who you dancin with
You just a middle man between the fiends and your management
Minneapolis, takes the passion with
A twist of lemon, ‘cause I’m on some old fashioned shit
So tell Anakin we lookin for Orlando with
Coach and the "Champion", go fix a couple sandwiches

[Chorus - Brother Ali]
Yeah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali

Ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that’s just my nature, none strong as we, come on

[Verse 3 - Brother Ali]
Used to raise babies in a funky old dirty place
So I kept me a snub nosed .38
Took it to the pawn shop on the first and paid
Rent with it, didn’t want to send ‘em to the pearly gates
In the clutch of the beat drop
See me hop up off the Sheetrock and strut like a peacock
Get your teeth knocked, clean out your speech box
Must not believe that meets the grease part
I wrote God a love letter with street chalk
Fell through potato chips, could of put beach hut
And there I stood in all of my splendor
‘Til I did believe I told ‘em everything that I meant to

[Chorus - Brother Ali]
Come down now, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali

Ah, come down walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that’s just our nature, none strong as we, ah

(Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down) ...

"But the squares won’t dance ‘cause they’re just all fakes
And they can’t understand the commands of the breaks" (breaks, breaks)

[Outro - Scratched Run-D.M.C. Sample]
"A stage, a crowd and two Rhymesayers" - 4X
"Two Rhymesayers"
"A stage, a crowd, a-a crowd, and two rhyme-Rhymesayers"

(*applause*)

[Syn] Yeah
[Dug] Yeah

[Dug] Yeah that’s that shit right there

      Put your hands to-ge-ther, always be two steps behind, c’mon
      Ha ha!  Yeah, they always be two steps behind

[No I.D.]
I got some niggaz in my way that’s tryin to fuck my shit up
Crabs in the bottle of the barrel tryin to get up
You can’t hold me down, can’t cock block the crown, get the
fuck out my way nigga, we cover ground that’s infinite
I press the weight to get gainage
I’m flushin out your wack ass shit like drainage
A thousand mo’ beats like this so get looted
I got niggaz under the gun and they shoot it

[Syndicate]
Uhh, uhh, say shoot it
Aiyyo, I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me? (You silly girl)
Hahaha, but really I’m nearly the best and the rest are just the average
Who knew that when I uttered a word, it would be tragic
Madness, inadequate ass-kicks
Tactics, my shit’s everlasting
Leaving a body casting so you can hold composure
I told ya, I gets more exposure than Motorola
It’s over, y’all niggaz on some out of mind shit
So I guess I’m on some out of time shit

[Dug Infinite]
But wait a minute, I gotta get some shit off my chest
Well my soul called in and it had a request
It said, ‘Bullshit niggaz think they’re, gettin away
But we tallyin your tab, bullshit gotta pay’ (it gotta pay)
It’s equality, nigga it ain’t nuttin nice
Catch you on a cold day and give you nuttin but ice
Crushed ice, rush dis, what da fuck is dis?
You couldn’t have a thousand hands and you couldn’t touch this
It’s that heat nigga, I come to burn up the shit
Let it burn to the ground, put it out with my spit
Ashes to ashes, yo dust to dust
Yo you standin in the way you gettin crushed (crushed nigga)

"Cause we write the records that be rockin every time
 The ones that chase us be like two steps behind" --> KRS-One
(repeat 4X)

[Dug Infinite]
Yo you could take it personal, I take it any way I can
Cause I’m versatile, when I be crashin up your plan
You wanna battle?  Oh you an MC, then where your beats at?
A carpenter, always got tools, at least a chief’s hat (hahaha)
Uhh, yeah yeah, I know you got got no cash nigga
Put me in, that position, I’ll be the last nigga
Never starvin artist, I never work the hardest
I always work the smartest better hope you ain’t my target (nigga)
When I aim, I blow shit up, ask Martino
Keep a killer on my team, like Casino
It’s Dug Infinite with No I.D. and Syndicate...
Hot damn hoe, it’s gon’ be some shit

[Syndicate]
Cause I’m your idol, the highest title, numero uno
Niggaz wish to test me like the ?
Try, but you know that I’m that cocoa, butta brown sister
Kickin up mo’ dust than the flusher weighed in Twister
Here to shake the rich I remember when I was younger
what I would be when I grew up is what I wondered
Now you’re plundered under, this younger world wonder
Chills, to your soul in the summer

[Dug Infinite]
Now I be tryin to be cool, plus tryin to stay humble
But niggaz take humble like it mean I don’t rumble
When I come for your shit, you gon’ need more than aid
Cause I’ma invade, like a fuckin renegade (nigga)
You don’t like me when I’m angry, cause I attack strangely
Hittin you from miles away, that’s how my range be
I’m on solid ground, that you ain’t gotta wonder
You on butter nigga when they heat up you sinkin under (whooh!)
See, you don’t walk out on me, nigga you crazy
Your shit ain’t real, it’s a Fugazi

"Cause we write the records that be rockin everytime
 The ones that chase us be like two steps behind" --> KRS-One
(repeat to end)

[Syndicate]
It’s a Fugazi!  Hahaha, yo’ shit’s a Fugazi, hahaha
Yaknahmsayin?  Niggaz stay two steps behind
Yo’ shit ain’t real it’s two steps behind nigga
Remember that, two steps behind, uhh, yeah, uhh
Syndicate, No I.D., Dug Infinite
on some next shit, yeah

[Dug Infinite]
Know they got to admit..
Straight up, straight up
Yeah
That’s right

[Sample: 4X]
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"

[Z-Ro]
Uh, I was down to my last dime with my stomach touching my back
Instead of my partners helping me, I was what they were laughing at
You can’t approach the girl of your dreams in Pro Wings and Wrangler jeans
A white five-oh shirt with the collar, plus no dollars
It’s been a long time since I stepped outside, next stopped at my daddy house
Back then Darryll Lewis was McVey Junior in my daddy house
I’m not tripping, I’m actually glad that they turned they backs on me
Fuck family and fuck friends too, it’s just me and my strap homie
Yeah I was that nerd nigga yesterday, the day I rapped homie
A pocket full of pencils became a pistol in my lap homie
I was voted most likely to become a teacher
Everybody class is in session, put your ear up to the nearest speaker
Today’s lesson is simple, if you don’t work you don’t eat
And the lowest level of a man is when he is living on the street
Whatever you put in the game, the game gon’ give back to ya player
That’s why my mind ain’t on these bitches, I keep my mind on paper

[Chorus: 2X]
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"
I got to keep my head on son
"Keep your mind on paper, keep your mind on paper"
"Keep your eyes on paper, keep your eyes on paper"

[Paul Wall]
I got my mind on that paper mayne, I’m thinking bout them stacks
My motivation is Benzos and Cadillacs
My decoration is candy coats and super boats
My worst nightmare is waking up and being broke
My mind frame is go get it with no excuse
If all that crying don’t help me then tell me what’s the use?
My hustle schedule is all night and all day
If there’s some paper to be made, then I’m on the way
My daily routine is stacking change and hitting licks
I use my wits to go get it when stacking chips
Now haters bumping they lips to try to throw me out
But my eyes on the green like I was playing golf
I’ll never ease up mashing until the day I croak
I’ll be eighty, selling plain meals to old folks
I keep my mind on bread just like a baker
My eyes on that paper till I meet my maker

[Chorus: 2X]

[Z-Ro]
See I might meet a chick, fuck the shit out her then take the hoe home
When you meet a chick, you fuck and the next day her home is your home
But at my crib, them type of shenanigans just don’t go on
Thinking I’m gon’ pay to see your pussy, bitch you got me so wrong
I might spend a lil’ here, spend a lil’ there
Never spend any of it on pussy, I’m a real player
Early birds get the worm, I’m up when the cock crows
I must live in a bakery cause I promise I got dough
This ain’t pay rent money, this play with money
When my friends stopped playing with me, I started to play with money
My nigga my ass, ain’t near one of y’all my nigga no more
Except for Jimbo, one night he caught me creeping up out of the bio
He knew I was down on my luck so he threw me a bone
Put money in my pocket, rented me a room and then my nigga was gone
Every since then I’ve been chasing paper like paper murdered one of my people
Having money ain’t wrong, the love of it is evil

[Chorus: 2X]

        Don’t fuck with the East Bay G!

repeat Intro 3 more times.

Ver 1:  Poke em down with the clip and the trigga
        Screamin like Eiht, yelling, "Come on Nigga!"
        Nappy-head muthafuckas in a coupe de-ville
        Lightin shit up like Fire Marshal Bill
        You see, I hops on the flo like my nigga Domino
        And get a big fat sack of yay
        A key or a half..the muthafuckin bay
        Pistol-whipped him with an A-K.
        Peep this, loddi-doddi, I shot up his body      
        I left his ass bloody in the front of the party.
        It’s a yig-a-young nigga rollin up out the cut
        Do a drive-by with the feds on my nutts.
        Niggas be gettin gatted when they step to this G
        See.....I pull my muthafuckin UZI!
        And, spill his brain (spill his brain)
        spill his brain (spill his brain)
        Spill his brain in his muthafuckin lap.
        I pulls a jack (pulls a jack)..Pulls a jack (pulls a jack)
        And shoot the heart out his muthafuckin back!
        I’m comin with the 187, not with that ho shit
        So niggas, pack up the bombs, so we can blow shit!

Repeat intro 2 times:

Ver 2:  Comin up in a mask like Tales of the Cryptic
        UZ thang swallows that ass like Lypton...Nigga!
        And now, they’re trying to wander and vigor
        How the fuck Charles Manson try to step to a nigga?
        Put a blast on their ass with the holes of the barrel
        Bullets fly in a chest like a muthafuckin farrow.
        Cause we get like Steven King, bodies swing from my ceiling
        Oak was in the chest when it’s time for cap peelin.
        9-4, hit the do with a fat gat
        Comin like this, break em down like that.
        The nigga with the bags and the fat crack sack
        Po-Poes on my back, blow their ass off the map!
        With the 1-8-7, mad man killa
        Spill a nigga guys for the fuck...Cause, I’ll be..

Repeat Intro 3 times:

Ver 3:  It goes one for the treble, you don’t wanna floss
        Unless you wanna flex with my bitch you little boss.
        Ga-a-gat that ass with the double-deuce Darringer
        From the bay area...the pall bearer
        6 niggas carry ya...momma in hysteria...
        Welcome to your muthafuckin coffin, they’ll stare at ya!
        Cause, you’re a dead muthafucka..black
        And you never should have fucked with the 1-8-7 fat.
        So nick-nack..patty-wack, give a G a gat
        And put some bullets in that ass crack!
        Yeah, break em down with the Mack
        And like John Madden 93, "BOOM!!!  He’s on his back!"
        Spice 1 is a muthafuckin troopa
        So, say what’s up to the East Bay Freddy Kruegar.
        Blow the head off the muthafuckin cow
        When my gat goes off like an air 1000.
        Take the hood off your hooptie when I bust a cap
        Rollin with my muthafuckin strap on my side!

Repeat Intro 8 times.

[Spawn]
When you die what you own on Earth won’t be coming with you
So all that fat shit you’ve got, I ain’t trippin that ain’t an issue
If you’ve got vibes, on a cool level we can talk but if you live lies
Through material-fertilized eyes and fantasize then walk
I use my vocals like chalk to sketch the picture you can see it
See unfold what I thought in my mind when I free it
Did the swallow get caught?  Yo does your throat feel tight?
Do you see what can happen when Atmosphere grabs the mic?
Just a word for you its funny and I think you caught its fever
All that shit you watch on tv has made you a believer
You don’t have to like me bitch, cuz I don’t really like you either
I don’t care if you’re rich, I had your girl, and I’m a leave her
Word I’m eager, to disrespect the petty thoughts of many reps
As I take steps and climb and leave footprints on your mind
I’ve designed my own lifestyle words and vowels instead of "rifals"
And hang out with rhymepals who tower like the "Eiffel"

[talking for eight bars]
Chorus[all]:
A lot of things change and somethings don’t
A lot of people fall off and some say they won’t
That’s right (That’s right) x2
Cuz we’ll fuck up your life like a crack pipe

[Extreme]
It’s the TC’s original b-boy Extreme
So when a nigga calls next you better pick your team
I hit the seam like doublestitch, twitch and get bent
A Rhymesayer nothing less than one hundred percent
You cats are far from inventive, cool and calm
I destruct an angled emcee before the touch of dawn
My wand be makin niggaz go "poof" with smoke
Nothing left but adidas, X ain’t no joke
I’m not out to get the quote of the month
Fuck a stunt
I’d rather grab the microphone and give you what you want
Opposite of a flaunt cuz my shits bang hard
Yeah you bust but I’m black jack you pulled the wrong card
There may be one too many I give you plenty like excessive
If you’re wack and grab the mic you end up in a state of depressive-
-Ness yes, couldn’t pass the test with a calculator
Rhymes like piranha, beat designed by the ANTinator
Hater never, I just wait till you’re tired
And then I give your ass a ticket cuz that last shit’s expired
Better yet tired, cuz your position’s been terminated
Wack niggaz bug me like pests and get exterminated

[Chorus]

[Slug]
(Yo Yo Yo)
Wanted to see if it was alive, started poking it (All:Pokin it!)
How could it survive when you’re chokin it? (All:Chokin it!)
When I can get a firm grip, I’m holdin it (All: Holdin it!)
And when I’m broke, I wear my girls deodorant [laughs]
Wait, did I say my girl, I meant my pimp
Cuz she’s the one with the money, and she walks with a limp
And honey, if you wanna purr you gotta register with her
Cuz she gets ninety five percent before any events occur
Sir, your self-imploding ego is adorable
Word, but your immature stee-lo is ignorable
I don’t know, maybe I’m just getting too old to flow
How much more must I invent before you seek retirement?
Repent and tell God that you feel shitty bout your actions
Bent in the back and I can only blame my passions
Well rounded relapses kept me at a fraction
When the wind died I found myself spread across the Tascam
How much thought did you put into that verse you brought?
What made you think I wasn’t gonna mock? Put a fucking tube sock
In that hole because I think it started to leak
Take two dicks and call me in a week

[Chorus] - 2X

\t"Of all the things my momma used to cook;
\t I liked.."\t"Chicken!"

[Richard Pryor]
You know that chicken I put in the refridgerator last night?
Well I expect to find it when I get home, or else!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Damn it really hurts my heart to remember these (remember these)
Days way back, in the seventies (seventies)
The only AIDS you used to know was Kool-AIDS
Corn-bread, corn-rows, and corn-br-AIDS
Pull up a chair, read a book like Dr. Seuss
Peel off the skin, eat all the meat
Nibble on the bone, and then suck the goo
Man if my mother was the Colonel, her chicken woulda sold
It even taste better THE NEXT DAY COLD
Chick-chicken.. chick-chick-chick-chicken
When I collect my thoughts I recollect
I used to listen to my moms (to my mommy)
"Damn it!" everyday,
"Boy you better clean up your room before you go outside and play"

[Prince Poetry]
Yo Monch you can remember when we used to play skelly way back
Blastin wax, side or tops, Prince don’t play that
Uh-oh, it’s six o’clock, I’m late for dinner
If my girl wasn’t his girl, I was definitely in her
Got in them print skirts (yo you was feenin for a chicken fix)
Ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix
..
Mom yells dinner’s ready, cause she’s the boss
All I needed was my ketchup, and my hot sauce
and my, cornbread, now I’m, ready to dig in
Pick the meat off the bone, and then I ate the skin

[Richard Pryor]
But I’ll tell you, what my mother would say..
"Somebody stole my piece of chicken!" ...
But I’ll tell you, what my mother would say..
"Somebody stole my piece of chicken!"

[Pharoahe Monch]
Round (up) round (up) one (two) three
I’m fresh out of the batch, and you can’t catch me
Mrs. Mary Mac, all dressed in black
She’s rather fat, and she, carries a bat
She’s the nosiest lady on the block when it’s hot
Cops get shot when we played SWAT
but no one never died though, we just cried
Only to laugh again when my moms made fried..

[Prince Poetry]
chicken barbecues in the summer was the move
Whoo!  Hah hah, hah hah hah, Grand Groove
was the jam Grandmaster Vic played in the park
past the dark, I seen the spark, so did me, Troy and Mark
Went to the rib shack, ordered chicken and the collard
greens but there’s no money left in my wallet
But I kept fifty cents for my juice (word?)
Now we would go to Troy’s house and get loose (uhh)
..
[Pharoahe Monch]
I’m.. just.. looking out of the window (window)
Watching the asphault grow (grow) slow (slow)
My best friend, was a G.I. Joe
although he had bald spots in his afro
Play with the kids your own age, that’s what they used to tell us
I got jealous, when we couldn’t run with the big fellas
Bullies on the block used to beat us
I was quick as a cat, in fact, I was a cheetah
Es-pecially when we played, follow the leader
Little Suzy May Robinson used to play
show and tell with my peter
..
[Prince Poetry]
I used to rock my British Walkers to church
After the choir sang the preacher started to preach
so I had to search
for a pen and some paper to keep myself occupied
But the aroma from the kitchen came and sat by my side
and said, "MmmmmMMM! You know I smell good"
I said to myself, "Please oh please reverend now would
you speed up the sermon so I can determine
whether I’ma have peas or collars greens
with my chicken that I’m yearnin"
Turnin to the usher in the back, whispering,
"Please keep the chicken monster from coming through
the crack of the door!"  Later at the table
moms poppped my hand until it was sore
Cause I ate the chicken, before
the preacher said grace, but I’m ready to go for self
But there’s not one piece of chicken on the table left
(What happened to that wing man?)
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken

[Richard Pryor]
You know that chicken I put in the refridgerator last night?
Well I expect to find it when I get home, or else!
But I’ll tell you, what my mother would say..
"Somebody stole my piece of chicken!"

\t"I didn’t take your chicken Pop"

[Prince Poetry]
Just wait til I get home, cause ain’t no chicken left
(hey that’s cool)
Miss Clarabell took the last piece of chicken
(that’s cool!)

Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it’s like time froze
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well
It’s like I’m always causing problems, causing hell
I didn’t mean to put you through this, I can tell
We’re gonna sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I’ll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

(you in the middle)
(you in the middle)

Lying down beside you. What’s going through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal
This gut feeling I’m tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill
We’re gonna sweep it under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I’ll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

(you in the middle)
(you in the middle)
(with you)
(you)

(thank the children)
(just thank the children)
(you)
(thank the children)
(just thank the children)

   
   As the last breath triggers the last beat
   I look to the sky to drown the devilish heat
   I feel it closin’, they’re gettin’ higher and higher
   Each foul flame from the same hellfire
   Only moments passed since I existed
   Perhaps I acted rash, I should have done what they insisted
   I resisted, twisted thoughts ran wild
   I was too mad to be mild, I was too rough to be riled
   But now it’s done, I probably won’t be missed by anyone
   Although I had my fun I’m still on the run
   Where am I goin’? It’s no good not knowin’
   Should be glad that I’m gone because my yellow streak’s showin’
   Thinkin’ have I done much wrong for me to perish
   Or will I have another day for me to cherish
   I have to bargain, see my soul’s on the line
   So I’ll settle for nothin’ lesser than the Great Divine
   
   Verse 2
   
   Friends worked hard to try and save me, why? They didn’t know
   If I was them I would’ve left me long ago
   It’s over, thoughts are trained towards the hereafter
   I look for The Saviour but then I hear laughter
   If I’m to make it through the Pearly Gates
   I have to devise a plan and get my story straight
   It ain’t too late to save my soul, I never lost a scheme
   I’ll talk to God and make him melt like an ice cream
   It seems this waiting is for reflection
   Then when it’s done I’ll go whatever direction I deserve
   But listen, I’ll deserve my place there
   Ok, I’m scared, but I don’t easily scare
   I’ll walk up, knock on the door like I’m the gentry
   Plead from my knee and they’ll proceed to give me entry
   I reflect on all the stealin’, the dealin’, the dissin’
   Hopin’ somewhere up in heaven that my file went missin’
   
   Verse 3
   
   I used to be a big man, like kings respected
   I carried out the sort of things expected of me
   And my posse, bred to be bossy
   Didn’t yield to command you felt the back of my hand, understand?
   I did dope, sold to kids who were thrilled by it
   I was responsible for many who were killed by it
   I didn’t realise then, but now I know
   I didn’t realise then, but even so
   I stole to deprive, scold those who patronised
   Fought for my turf, it was worth it in my eyes
   Cheated, repeated all this day by day
   Until the medic picked me up from where I lay
   Bleeding, but not conceding to the battle
   The darkness teased an unease, light bleeds staccato
   That’s when I knew I had to try it
   Prepare a prayer and pray he’d buy it
   Convince him, rinse him of my dirty past
   Rotten or right I must fight to the last
   Before the hands that pulled me down held tight
   I will repent before the love of life
   Fear cries, I’m drowned and bound to miss
   Valhalla, my seat in celestial bliss
   Infernal heat just like a creature creepin’
   Eternal sleep will be a lonely sleepin’
   
   Verse 4
   
   Father friend me, defend me
   Lend me your faith so that my fate don’t send me
   Down to the gates of Hell
   I did enough time inside a prison cell
   So take me, don’t forsake me
   Shape me from here so that my fear don’t break me
   Keep me from the terror that lies
   Beneath your kingdom, beneath the skies...
   
   Did he buy that? Well did he hear my prayer?
   I gave praise, I’m amazed he’s still up there
   He’s probably sendin’ down a heavenly host
   He’s just too busy to be leavin’ his post
   So I wait for a while but the Devil’s still posin’
   I wave goodbye while the gates are closin’ behind me
   You’ll never bind me or enslave me
   Hurry up heaven, come down and save me.

Verse 1: MGD

Back on the block from the last time I came, last time I told ya
Now don’t get caught trippin’, trying to trap, and we don’t know ya
Cause you gone get yo sack took and ran clean off the street
And I ain’t gone even shot ya buster, I’m beating ya wit the heat
Work ??? a half just to start up
Bring me back the ten then break ‘em all down to quarter’s
Servin hustla’s to servin J’s, nickels and dimes
Cause them the hustla that put the meaning behind the word grind
So what’s the hassle dawg, if ya feel me bust up a cap dawg
Nothing but love, for this muthafucking trap dawg
Playing a zone, straight get my serve on
Oh we git straight to it, so you can kill that you heard homes
Bringing back a triple like it ain’t no thing
Cause y’all serving skimpy sacks to make the re-up change
That’s right I stay in the lab, cooking this dope everyday
And keep y’all ass looking for that everlasting yay

Hook: 4x

Yeah\xc2\x85 (Everlasting yay)

Verse 2: Pastor Troy

I got the ? on the block of the bay
Looking at my watch in case these cops want to play
I’m waiting on Jay, baby what’s the word
I got a million dollars down here floating on the curb
I got to smoke my herb, to keep me from nuttin’ up
It’s to hot on 9th, I got to take it to the cut
And I’m too cold to touch, and got a partner name Mike
Say what? Sell coke I almost made it out my night
But went to thinking twice, after the birdies got him
But they don’t want buddy, they his buddy at the Simp
So I’m a call Kim, tell him put the package up
Something is bout to happen and it’s gone to be corrupt
I made a couple bucks, but I’m making more now
Shit wanna flip the game, Pastor Troy a show you how
See I can make a vow, cause the grind was my dad
The more I think about it, the more it make me mad

Hook: 4x

Verse 3: Lil’ Pete

I started selling coke when I was sixteen
The hard butter crunked it up for them dope fiends
It’s none other than the one they call Little Pete
Yeah ya know me, that small nigga from baller street
Pay what you owe me, slowly I came up
From dust to dawn buddy, now my folks ain’t having fun
We out here grinding, diming, serving, dirty from hustling
But when I get clean like Cinderella it’s a dream
That means never, its eighteen’s or better
My dash is leather and I pack a Beretta
Whatever you wanna do we can do
Before you do, go find yo muthafucking crew

Verse 4: MGD

I’m blazing trees on the look out for my enemies
The dirty cheese and them broads that work on they knees
Better stay at home, better stay off the streets
Pastor Troy, Little Peter, and MGD

Hook to end

(*talking*)
Yeah 7-1-3 new South, Sucka Free
In the trunk, we on your heels mayn
Holla back, come on come on

[Yung Redd]
Only if you knew, I’m playing by my own rules
Keep a new pair of 22’s, for the old school
Neck full of rose gold, hoes spreading the news
Even them days I was broke, I was paying dues
A hundred miles and running, you couldn’t fill my shoes
I break bread with my niggaz, yeah that’s what niggaz do
These clowns plotting on me, got me looking in my rear
Nothing but blood and shedding tears, through most of my years
But anyway I showed and proved, to most of my peers
Sooner or later, recognized me as a pioneer
Who would of thought, that I’d be playing the right cards
And more grain than a lawn, in your front yard

Now you can tell, we all about them dollar bills y’all
Plus I got 24 inches, on my wheels y’all
Them niggaz playing mayn, I gotta keep it real y’all
I’m on the grind, so I get it how I live y’all - 2x

[Lil’ Ron]
I’m money getting, while niggaz slipping they really tripping
I’m on a mission, peep how I’m living them chicks is flipping
Now pay attention and listen, the game ain’t switching
Did I mention if it’s tension, then your lil’ ass missing
Stop depending on niggaz, and get your own cash
I love spending that money quick, so I make it fast
And it seems, some of these rap niggaz flow is trash
But me, I’m leaving the bank with big money bags
Don’t try to snatch my shit, nigga I will blast
Them hollow tips, got your ass stuck to the grass
The spinners on the drop, look like they doing cart-wheels
My money long, like I discovered the arch build

[Hook - 3x]
I represent, that 7-1-3 nigga

[Scooby]
It’s them hustler stacking, ghetto reality live from the H
And the truth is, we got it on fire in the H
So no problem, we don’t mind taking your place
We ain’t come for the chump change, we came for the safe
And hey, thrown in the field
If you ain’t never been in the real car, that wasn’t going very far
Or you just a stupid nigga, let them other dummies move with ya
Cause y’all, ain’t taking down Scoob’ nigga

[Unique]
I’m Grit-tastic, these hoes adore this
I’m on point with my bucks, like TJ Ford g’eah
You niggaz is worthless, got no purpose
Might as well be a sideshow, and work for a circus ay
I’m bout my fast money, ask around
And if you ask bout my money, hit your ass with pounds clowns
7-1-3, you ain’t noticed
Unique that bastard boy, I’m so focused

[Poppy]
Guess who’s back in the mix, from the land where they package and ship
Crack on the strips, we added to get the cabbage and split
And for the cabbage, automatics’ll rip
Baggies to bits, by any means when we after the chips
Fuck being average ships, you need power to play
Whether you work a nine to five, or turn powder to yay
Get out the way, that’s how he put it down in the H
We ride chrome, a inch for every hour of the day ay

[Hook - 3x]

Yeah-yeah, holla at me

[What What]
I’m sittin sippin soda realizin that it’s over
My feelings he couldn’t reciprocate til October
But he’s the one I wanna lay my head upon his shoulder
And keep it warm cause it’s just about to get colder
But I said I wouldn’t see him, nor would I touch him
He says he misses much and pursue per sound to suction
through the phone, I try to hit the dialtone to clear the mess up
or fess up, and say I’ll be there soon just clear your rest up
I can’t dismiss it, no matter how much I just can’t resist it
And now he’s tellin me he finally wants to be committed
I can’t call it, without me playin myself to fall for it
Scannin my mind to see how much time I can stall
or it can blow up, other kissings affect like anisthetic
It’s never as good as the first time and you never do forget it
Feeling pathetic, but I quote it like someone said it
If you really love it then you should just let it, go..

Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress
I let it, go.. let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress

Three times this year I’ve seen my people go to violent action
that could have been avoided without negative instigation
Goin on, off at the mouth, with foul verbal interaction
Inevitably ending up with one or more gunshot patients
I guess it’s not a virtue anymore and scores gotta be settled
with steel or real ain’t even in the flesh and don’t feel
But eighteen feet of soil was dug out
Three brothers lives was struck out
Cause you wanted to be down, but without catchin a body you stuck out
Hey, what goes around is ultimately what you get
Sometimes good people and bad things mix
Sometimes you got to fix the way you live
I give my life to bring back family and friends
But I don’t control that I know that mine’s precious til the end
I leave my lifecourse to the greater knowledge of the creator
And if it’s time to go, I won’t hold back, I’ll just let it, go..
Let it flow, if it’s meant to come back then it shall do so

Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress
I let it, go.. let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress

At thirteen I watched ghetto gold turn to green
and get crushed, through this undramatical street scene
When all my peoples like to whyle out
wearin the low style out
One night we stood in front of Homebase
watched the club file out
Mad people started runnin, that was the end of fun and
one nigga stand in b-boy stance, holdin his gun and
started shootin, pollutin the curbside with shells
Yellin buggin out cause someone stepped on his Gazelles
or Asics, whatever it was, money’s beef was basic
It’s tragic the way people takin anger and misplace it
Now, mad are my peoples wearin scars and stitches
cause niggaz choose to play the role of actin like bitches
Don’t take it hard, if it’s not you, act like you know
And all that unnecessary shit, just let it, go..

Let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress
I let it, go.. let it go, let it flow
Move on with your life and act like you know
Been on my last breathe, been between life and death
but I gotta let it go, can’t deal with the stress

[Intro]
This goes out to all the brothers and sisters locked down
You’ve got much love from Tha Dogg Pound and the LBC
(yeah yeah yeahhh)
Your baby is waiting for you to come home

[South Sentrelle]
I got a letter from my babe
Saying he doesn’t feel the same
He said all his feelings changed
And he’s tired of the games i play
Never thought he knew
About my secret rendezvous
But through all the cheating and the lies
The truth finally came to light (came to light)
Now I’m reading through the lines
(Memories easing) memories easing thorough my mind
Trying to put it all behind
But I’m still asking why
I treated you so bad
I never really knew how much i had
Until you were gone (until you were gone)
And now I’m alone (and now I’m alone)
So baby come home

[Chorus x2]
Baby come home
Where you belong
I know I was wrong
This is my song

I find it hard to rest my head
Tossing and turning in my bed
Late at night it’s hard to sleep
Because those memories just keep on flashing in my dreams
At times i feel i have to scream
I just can’t keep this pain inside
So i decide to write a letter in return (i go to my letters)
Tell him my lesson has been learned (my lessons been learned)
After all the tables turn
He’s my only concern
Because I miss you so much (I’m missing you much)
And I really miss you touch (I’m missing your touch)
And I’m guilty of misusing love
So baby come home

[Chorus x2]
Baby come home
Where you belong
I know I was wrong
This is my song

[through chorus]
Now I apologize for all the cheating and the lies
I know I was wrong
This is my song to you

[N-Tyce]
Come and go see creep with me, secretly
Male companion frequently, meet with me
Poison, you can expect the unexpected
Jail contact vision corrected you get injected

[J-Boo]
Step up if you wanna bring, I sit back and let Mary sing
While you niggas fiending
Wishing you could roll with these rap chicks
Come a dime a dozen, pushing fat whips with the mack clip

[Champ Diva]
I love my bitches, and my bitches come first
If worst comes to worst, somebody’s gonna get hurt
So step out of way, nah, come equipped, don’t play
I got a pro arm, make room or make my way

[Finesse]
What’s the schematic, heard you was a leaner, acting dramatic
Poppin’ static, if you step in my zone, it’s in the tragic
Watch ‘em tag it, like an item, when I bag it
Dag it, gotta put it in, through these magnets

[N-Tyce]
Yo, lyrically I be able, to bring it back like a turntable
Disconnect like illegal cable
Fan my horizon, pocket sizing
Watch you with my left eye like Rison
Cash double flash eagle, my nigga ask, don’t spread rumors
Wanna know something, ask me
Protect Ya Neck’s the click, with my big head
With the hit, yeah, you know I be the chick that’s slick
In my drop top, rocking Clue tapes, making true tapes
Off the platinum hits my crew makes
Check it, three three six area codes
Various soul, Deadly Venoms out of control

[Champ Diva]
I’m a rebel, I’m a rebel, grab before the gun will shovel
Digging a bigger hole, take it to a different level
Getting emotional, but wont stop me from hurting you
Or catch guns to punch it to you
Well over due, here’s a crew, I’m putting it down
For my crew, shorty one love, pulling the plug
One love, hundred percent, DV, represent
Keep my face in the bill, like the president

[Finesse]
Get the raw feeling, it’s Chamelly and it’s repping silly
Cuz things ain’t chilly, I want yall bitches to feel me
When I spark like a Philly, or bust like a milli
I talk a four five, like you bad ass Billy
So see me, DV, have you wining like BB
I can’t help myself, I’m O.G.
D.V., with heart like a Bee-Gee
OC’d out like a Y.G., why me, I keep this shit lively

[J-Boo]
Last in, never give a fuck who you are
You don’t know I’m bout to be a mega superstar
Who am I? I be the cause of your only lost
My goal is to reign supreme like Diana Ross
Coming through on the low, I do my dirt when I’m do
Headed for my next show

[Chorus: J-Boo]
Just can’t help the way, that we feel
Venoms keep it real, so we bring the raw deal
I don’t care what you feel, cuz we heading the bill
So you niggas best to chill, before shit get real

[Scratching]

[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
What’s up for ‘95? Yeah, ‘95 sound live!
From doin’ crimes, no more runnin’ from one-time
Although I know I role I gets for my title
When I was young, that nickel-plated Four-Fifth was my idol
Chrome, stones, bones, and portable phones
getting’ big hoes while I’m sittin’ at home
Is what I scheme of, so NOW what I dream of
is a life full of trouble, in fact
countin’ double digit stacks
lay back for a minute, 400 SEL, yeah, I could see myself in it!
Murder for money, you ever heard of a dummy
with glocks between his tummy, low down dirty and crummy
Talkin’ bout that Thug Life be the only life I know
talkin’ bout that drug life without this rap shit
probably be the only route I go
And matter of fact I know I’ll strive through this fo sho

[Scratching]

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me?  I’m out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone’s, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I’m dreamin
Seein Daddy’s semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route?  For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: EDI]
Everday there’s mo’ death, and plus I’m dough-less
I’m seein mo’ reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain’t no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I’m bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain’t workin
And Evil’s lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a ‘L’, but oh well

[Scratching]

Twenty four inches off the ground like Jeezy
Got that thang homie so you better take it easy
Catch me in the hood knockin pictures off the wall
Sittin sideways like the nigga Paul Wall
Got a four fifty-four and it’s all chromed out
Just bought a platinum grill like the one off in my mouth
Niggaz down south all we do is ride heavy
Could had a Bentley but I rather ride Chevy
Pistol in my lap give a fuck about the law
Hoes see me coming and they all gon ball
Got ten bad bitches and they all gon call
Got five screens and they all gon fall
Old school new school we done had em all
All my niggaz ridin Chevys so we all gon ball

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Cadillac Don]
Monkey see monkey do so everybody got a Chevy
Three fifty with the flow masters the bitch runs heavy
Keep it clean plus it ride good
When I’m rollin through the hood
I get down in it that bitch sounds good
And for you niggaz who’s snitches shit can’t be trusted
Might as well call me Lee Dungarees I can’t be busted
But I’m Cadillac Don nigga a real fucking hustler
Ridin through the south spreadin this game like mustard
I’m a Cadillac rider true enough
Better ball in the Chevy when I strut my stuff
Making money can’t get enough
Haters get mad they fuss and cuss
Check my rep I drop the top
Lean out the Chevy let the four five pop
Cut it to the middle can’t wait for cops
Sixteen switches watch that ass go drop
We hittin the curb three wheel motion
Seeing double drinking on the potion
I’m a movie  I’m hustlin and flowin
Getting paid, stacking, tokin
For this boy y’all niggaz ain’t ready
Give me the crown I deserve the credit
Or catch me fucking your bitch in the Chevy
Inside butter outside grape jelly

[Hook: repeat 2X]

Bang, bang, earned another neighborhood medal
Hit the pedal, it sounded like this
Another one down on his death list
Stayed pissed tight fist, when one even glanced
Tech-9 slid in front of his pants
At a dance one disses his partner Bo
Kid ain’t know Bo was with Lil Trig and Joe
Joe asked Bo: ‘Yo, you know that kid?’
‘Step to that kid for what he done did!’
So Bo stepped, talked to me son?
Bang, bang, bang, got done, not one
Bodies dropped, yes, yes, he did
Sprayed the whole spot, guess who? Lil Trig...

Was on a mission going bazerk
Sucked his teeth when moms mentioned work
‘Jerk, jerk, good for nothing bum!’
Pops said to Lil Trig, his son, while sipping rum
Was numb, no sorrow when playing crap
Stayed strapped when he’d loose, pulled out and attacked
Took the bank, that’s how he live, he didn’t give a
Shot any and plenty, yes, Lil Trigger...

Lil Trig, many feared and disliked
So cold he robbed a lady who had no sight
Blind, didn’t matter, he’d shoot a cop
Wouldn’t stop till he seen the cop drop
He shot a kid dead in the dome
Took his ride, Rolex and cellular phone
Guess what he done next?
Crashed his girl cause she had sex...
With this kid on the other side of the town
Trig was steaming hot, said gonna kill that clown
Called three of his soldiers, they rolled out
Looking for that kid’s whereabouts...

Creeped slowly, lights off, car full
I’m not even gonna mention first who pulled...
At five kids kicking it on the steps
Bang, bang, bang, sound of a Tech
Ducked, bullet flew through a screen
Hit a girl in the eye, only thirteen
From a donut spot came to where they was firing
High beams, colorful lights and sirens
Quick U-turn, Trig kept spraying but...
Cop shot the driver, threw the door in the gut
Car out of control, hit a pole
Two dead, other knocked out cold
Trig in a daze, cop said: ‘Hands up! I repeat!’
He did the opposite, bang, dead in his seat
One survivor serving life, can you figure?
Was it the gov’t, his pops, the streets or Lil Trigger?

Intro Chorus:
Everything I had imagined is starting to happen
Everything I wanted all the dreams that I had back then

Raw never been stepped upon and I do it my way
Coming at me wrong’ll do you like Sade

Chorus:

I ain’t tryin’ to get married, I got chicks everywhere
Nigga

Wifeys, they call me Sancho
Sanchas, they call me Chato

Pieced up con el rosario
Puffin’, fumando gallo
Carreras de caballos
Fuck it, weigh gallos frios
Home-of-your-life motivo
Choppin’ cuerno de chivo
Illegal enemigo
Paisa es en el stylo
Pistiando puro pinos
Stackin’, rip, flippin’ kilos
Hold up with the dilly, why they actin’ so freely
Like P. Diddy, at each south, nigga, we runnin’ this city
They hit it liks, it’s hard time, boy, the hood’s getting gritty
You ain’t crunk, you ain’t drunk, you ain’t shit, motherfucker
Go wiz up on your card, don’t make a thug, you cocksuckers

Repeat Chorus

[Intro]
En este juego y en cualquiera
siempre atacan al que esta arriba
por la ambicion y el temor inventan estupideces
y no saben lo que hacen
soy Don Dyablo, el Profeta, orgullo guerrillero

[Verse 1]
Es el poder y el dinero lo que mueve al mundo
de traicioneros y hocicones esta lleno el mundo
pues el valiente vive hasta que el cobarde quiere
y el pescado por su pinche puta boca muere
descocerte los huevos antes de que abras la boca
robas mi estilo eres chueco, eres rata loca
eras la copia de los delincuentes ya cambiaste
eres la copia del Profeta puto me copiaste
yo nunca te falte al respeto mas ponte trucha
porque el Dyablo esta encabronado y hasta anda suelto
practica bien mi estilo puto perro mal nacido
te di la mano la mordiste mal agradecido
pues me jurabas que no eras bajo mundo
pues lambes huevos mal te ira de eso sabes te lo juro
yo soy de sangre azteca, orgullo guerrillero
soy el padrino de este estilo y no soy traicionero

[Chorus]
Que quien, que yo, que soy Don Dyablo y que
por hocicon y lambe huevos puto te ataque
que quien, que tu, que el, que yo no fui
te hagas pendejo solo tienes celos tu de mi
por una traicion, por pendejada y media
por imitarme a mi me demostraste vales mierda
mi orgullo es guerrillero, tu eres el embustero
eres bastardo y culero perro traicionero

[Verse 2]
La ejecucion de una cancion es tu pinche excusa
difamacion solo blasfemas ahora ponte trucha
tu no existias en el mapa, eres ojete eres solapa
mantente al margen porque el Dyablo ataca
que porque tengo lo tu querias
porque yo soy lo que tu querias ser
la destruccion de todos esos pinches impostores
resureccion de todos esos putos como tu
tienes 10 a\xc3\xb1os en este negocio
tengo 2 a\xc3\xb1os yo en este negocio
ahora dime quien te abrio a ti las puertas
no te confundas dije puertas no de quien te abrio las patas
esta no es tu cancion, es un recordatorio
no digas pendejadas que te mando al purgatorio
todo mundo me ataca, el Dyablo se te escapa
pero me ven en carne viva y se ponen a gatas

[Chorus]
Que quien, que yo, que soy Don Dyablo y que
por hocicon y lambe huevos puto te ataque
que quien, que tu, que el, que yo no fui
te hagas pendejo solo tienes celos tu de mi
por una traicion, por pendejada y media
por imitarme a mi me demostraste vales mierda
mi orgullo es guerrillero, tu eres el embustero
eres bastardo y culero perro traicionero

[Verse 3]
En este juego todos quieren tumbar al de arriba
todos siguen al lider necesitan de su guia
podran copiarme mis palabras, podran copiarme mis estilos
pero comprar mi gente ni con tiros
porque mi gente siempre ha sido fiel
yo todo se los debo eso tambien yo lo se
soy un guerrero, soy azteca
y aunque les arda el culo seguire siendo yo el due\xc3\xb1o de discos Profeta
este es mi estilo y marca registrada
no sirves pa’ nada te operas los huevos, eres mandilon
te pega tu hyna tumbada por mas que practiques tu nunca podras
tu ser como yo, tener lo que yo, actuar como yo, pensar como yo, vivir como yo, no
porque no tienes lo que necesitas
para vender usas mi estilo y homie te me aguitas
si quieres guerra simplemente te la voy a dar
y si me ofendes solo espera lo que va a pasar

[Chorus]
Que quien, que yo, que soy Don Dyablo y que
por hocicon y lambe huevos puto te ataque
que quien, que tu, que el, que yo no fui
te hagas pendejo solo tienes celos tu de mi
por una traicion, por pendejada y media
por imitarme a mi me demostraste vales mierda
mi orgullo es guerrillero, tu eres el embustero
eres bastardo y culero perro traicionero

   "Hit me" *scratched by A-Trak*
Logik

[Logik]
O.D. shit, start at the beginning like birth
I plant my seed first, all legiondary thoughout the Earth
I spit my true worth, y’all talk shit at the very least
I make my people rise up, I lace my lyrics with yeast
I highlight like a feltpen, get felt like a highlighter
I’m that same cat that turned rhyme cats to rhyme biters
Frontliners to Flatliners
I made die hard soldiers camaflague with eye liner
But these shot fire, to spit ashes
Linguistically attract masses, physically slap you backwards
You whole style awkward, game predictable like clockwork
Show your colours man, hike up that skirt
Yeah, you bust premature when you heard Obscure’s a skin pigment
Imagine that, the main figment
Stay distant, ‘cause we wild like Serengetti
Get ready, niggas are useless like biscuits on safety

CHORUS [Obscure Disorder]
We make it hot
If the stakes is high, raise the stocks
If hard knocks is still with us, raise your glocks
If you got love for your niggas, raise the blocks
We from Mont Real, bringing the real, blaze the spots
We make it hot
If the stakes is high, raise the stocks
If hard knocks is still with us, raise your glocks
If you got love for your niggas, raise the blocks
We from Mont Real, bringing the real, blaze the spots

[I-Con]
Sit back and incinerate
Expect the bigger rate if I reinerate, just one line
Niggas better have your back ‘cause I hunt spines
With clutch rhymes at crunch time, unexpected
Introduce y’all to what the Montreal dialect is
I sword methods, shaking down your small weapons
Fuck Lugers(?), you die sooner with chokers jokers(?)
I shoot maneuvers, I like bathed with new consumers
Your laws are like intercourse when I jerk off you had be better off
Set ‘em off to the trench at any expense
Past present and future I be rapping intense
Didn’t get the double meaning, think of strong arm and musclin’ me
Try that shit, and have you raching your demise that quick
Colliding on me is like you’ll deciding to be
A marked man, run down by an unmarked van
Abort your plans, to blow on you, you an unarmed man
Couldn’t rock a charm if you had one in your hand

CHORUS

[Eclipse]
Casually walking in on my own
Usually don’t give a fuck who’s around, having dialogues in my dome
Suddenly I felt the light change, I could chill on my bone
Try to conceal it to my surprise see reality shown
Once were rags and riches, played with sticks and stones
Opened my eyes seen your lies now your cover was blown
This do or die shit was like a dice game and I couldn’t explain it
Mercy on a nigga that was dropped on this planet
Shit is manic causing panic in static
Like wearing skirts in the casually zone
Look at us, Kings and Queens that have became from the throne
Scientist clones, human beings in my face
I’m really seeing morning noon, day and night
From January to December, it’s like an apocalyptic site
See I thought I read the book, I guess the title wasn’t right, aight

  *A-Trak cutting and scratching beat*

CHORUS
What!

[Intro/Outro]
Yeah... uh-huh
I like the way you work it girl, uh-huh
I like the way you move it baby, yeah
I love the way you’re workin it girl {*2X*}
I love the way you’re doin it girl
I love the way you make it work
I love the way you’re doin it girl, I love it

[Greg Nice]
On the dancefloor she be breakin it down
Workin it low, like yo it ain’t nuttin
Uhh, oh, yo, now that’s my type
Solo key yo, but she get hype
A shot of tequila, with a little Red Stripe
We do nasty, all damn night
We don’t fuss yo, and we don’t fight
Make it rain, clear it out, aiyyo, aight?

[Chorus]
I like the way you work it girl, that’s what’s up
And when you drop it low girl, that’s what’s up
The way you back it up girl, that’s what’s up
I like how you shakin it, that’s what’s up
I like the way you work it girl, that’s what’s up
And when you drop it low girl, that’s what’s up
The way you back it up girl, that’s what’s up
And I love the way you work it girl that’s what’s up

[Greg Nice]
Amazing how she work that body
No doubt about it, know she a hottie
Ain’t no broke chick, got her own shit
Ain’t no punk bitch, splurge a little bit
Rock the hell out the baseball cap
Pump, wifebeater, blue jeans, she all that
Everyday girl with that special twist
You know I put her name up on my guest list

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
When she walk inside, the whole club freeze
Stone cold fox like zero degrees
We scramble it up like eggs and cheese
Jet black hair, think she from Belize
When she walk through the crowd, she leave a trail
Scent and aroma smell like Chanel
Open wide, trapped in your spell
I’m feelin on your booty like R. Kel’

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
Aiyyo she always got two girlfriends with her
Ain’t gon’ front yo one got a shitter
Other one always yappin ‘bout Twitter
Caught me lookin at her girlfriend’s shitter
Love the way she workin but I still hit her
Guess you could call me a greedy go-getter
Homeboy asked me why do I sweat her?
Go against the grain even though I know better

[Chorus]

Mi gente de Maryland ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

I’m A Rhydah (repeated)

[Gunplay]
Yo, uh uh, this strictly for the snorters (laughs) yeah nigga

[Chorus]
Take dis to the brain, huh, hold up, lemme’ see how I’ma do this
Take dis to the brain, look, check me out though, uh
Take dis to the brain, and tell me how quick you feel the drain
Take dis to the brain, and tell me how quick you feel the drain

[Gunplay]
Take dis to the motherfucking head, to the nose, to the face, to the wig
Can’t smell my cologne, or taste my ribs
My shit a faucet on drill, leggo
Lost five pounds in the last five hours
And got a photo shoot, still tooting chowder
Look at me wrong and I’ma shoot the whole crowd up
You don’t know what you’re doing, I’ma show you how to
Mirror, strong, wildin’ out in my cellar
No straight jacket, I’m Jupiter Jack Daniels
What up bitch, let me cock your spaniel
Wash a nigga dread’s, clean out a nigga dandruff
My nuts sweaty but she licked them already
New Bugatti still pumping eighty-seven unleaded
I’m a hog on my money, take it all with me to heaven
Bitch we living in hell, how the fuck he the reverend
Junkie, flunky
But I keep it, one-thou’ wow funky
Like a nigga should, like a real nigga would
Fuck all them jelly back fan packer woods
I’m on my square feet, never see air
Whacking all these niggas like I never seen the chair
You looking at my shoes like you never seen a pair
Slice a sweet swisher, but my medicine in there
I ran out of money, now a nigga betting bill
When Peanut died, the only time I shed a tear
I be hunting for the cunt, I’m a pussy-predator
Drop a new bitch if the newer one got better hair

[Chorus]

Verse 1:
Yo, yo, you can let the magnum bust
Or puff bags of dust
If you mad at us
Watch that ass get crushed
Now you screamin why did the blood have to rush
There’s a buncha thugs after us
Slugs blast at us
Son roll this dutch master up
The nigga with the live weapons
Yo, who got shorties runnin
They comin in 5 seconds
Givin back shots, attack spots
Fat knots
I rap hop like clack glocks
Disrespect this and get disconnect
This spray like disinfected
I paractice safe sex so my dick’s protected
F hold the cap well
Puffin fat l’s bonin a chicks listenin to Maxwell
On a maxell my man call me on the black cell
Told me he got bagged for a crack-sell
"How you feelin son?"
"Not that well"
Niggas is bustin tecs and shit
And no matter what sexe you is
Behind your back niggas will sex yo’ whip
Make you wonder where the exit is
Fuc That cuttin no slack
I’m bustin fat nuts on yo’ back
  
Chorus x3:
Yo, what it look like
You got crack what it cook like
You got a track what the hook like
F is off the hook, right?
We stole cars while you took bikes
And on a good night I get your whole hood sniped
  
Verse 2:
You’s a halfthug
Meetin ya dick in the bathtub
I get mad love
Do a crime woke ya backup?
Roll in the set
Put a hole in ya chest
Open ya flesh
Knowin the best
No one can test
I’m blowin ya vest
Untill I die I be high of drugs
Money bought me everything but couldn’t buy me love
My niggas blast and shoot shit
From here to Massachussets
The cash be ruthless
That’s why your ass is toothless
You ain’t half as ill as the admirill
You a crab for real nigga, grab your shield
Rappers wanna kill me and blast me
Cause my rhymes is Filthy McNasty
While other niggas is silky and sassy
Upset your squad I never wet you God
Y’all niggas ain’t worth a $1.50 on the metrocar
Fuc That
I bust caps
Chill on the side like hop cats
Never leave home without the rough raps
Paper I got to touch that
You want bitches I want track
  
Chores x2
  
Verse 3:
Yo, I role this hoe that will set you up to take your check
Them niggas that make you pet, to break your neck
Her mind was the dirtiest
Ever since her pops died on the 30st
She was livin the life of unworthiness
Her name was Karin
She drove a black LeBaron
And by the way, she used to sell packs of tracks with Aaron and Tyrone
Doin anything to be in the live zone
Like smoke five bones or rob the jewelery store for nine stones
Attack your town pack a cab
Smack a clown
Back ‘em down like Jackie Brown
You never had skill
I’m mad ill like a overdose of Adville
Kill at will
  
Chorus x2
  
Noreaga "The invincible, untouchable"
OC "Fuc That, abbreviated F.T."
Nas "Streets disciple, I rock beats that’s make ‘em trifle"

[Intro]
("Soul, soul-soul, soul-soul")
Yeah, it’s E-V ("How, much can you get")
Evidence, CookBook ("for your soul...")
Uno Mas {that’s whassup} let’s go!
("When you rock and roll")

[CookBook]
Honies know that money is the thing that they want
And brothers that money is the thing that they want
And both’ll hit the block and try to hustle it up
In the club sellin they soul ("when you rock and roll")
Brothers’ll fight for the ("money, money")
That dough’ll make the closest friendships start to feel funny
Your homey that you run with starts to hide certain agendas
Suddenly the great pretender ("when you rock and roll")
Yeah, don’t even bring it to the world of rap music
When we’re broke it’s buddy buddy, money comes you start to lose it
Your group starts with a dream to hit the scene and change things
Behind the scene they fightin ‘bout the same things ("when you rock and roll")
You can’t survive without that ("money, money")
Record companies give little but want everything from me
I signed it like a dummy, now I lost my control
Gave away my soul, just so I could rock and roll

("How, much can you get for your soul...")
("When-when you rock and roll")

[Evidence]
Hit the road, pack my bags, say goodbye
You know heroes get remembered, but legends never die
So I never say never, and never ask why
they pay no tolls, I guess that comes ("when you rock and roll")
Right, doin shows now there’s ("money, money")
Last year you was dumbin out, broke and bummy (crazy)
They used to want advice, now they tryin to son me
It’s funny how the tides change, y’know? ("When you rock and roll")
Cash in pocket, big bank, money fold
Accounts drained, but keep a green gangster’s roll
They keep they thanks and they praise on hold
Takes for granted no matter the debt never owed ("when you rock and roll")
Small change or big ("money, money") cha-ching!
I’m broke they don’t call, I got loot they love me
I know both sides of the fence; some days I feel like Mike
Other days Evidence is rock and roll

("How, much can can you get for your soul...")
("When-when you rock and roll")

[Uno]
Yeah, every day
Another day, another rhyme, flippin pennies to a dime
Over ten plus years been tryin to earn my shine
Make moves, stay ahead of the game and stack dough
And keep your business on point yeah ("when you rock and roll")
Everybody want that ("money, money")
Survival of the fittest and I’m tryin to stay hungry
Keep the work ethic up, nothing’s given, nothing free
If you got a lot to lose, then don’t be an emcee
This industry will pimp you out like they own the block
If your stock don’t rise then you might get locked
Doin time cause you signed, your career’s on hold
Live and learn or get burned ("when you rock and roll")
Whack emcees makin ("money, money")
You can find me in the lab, doin work, livin grimy
Nothin shiny on my neck but I got mic control
And that’s the only thing you need when you
("When you rock and roll") {*echoes*

Chorus: E-TRAIN

‘All Aboard the TRAIN’
‘All Aboard the TRAIN’

Verse One: E-TRAIN

I’m new school but I feel like Dre day shit
Plus my money ‘gon multiple like Bebe’s kids
I’m ‘bout to better myself like AA trips
No steps I’m Audi in the A8 kits
And I sit with the clip, counting millions that I’m jock’n
And my finger tips’ spilt, from the paper that I pocket
City Slicker Chain
with Billy Crystals on it
In the city with the Range
let the mommy sizzle on it
It’s E-TRAIN
and the DJ is scratching it
My beats flame and my relay is passionate
I keep flame and speak slang or rapper’s pen
I’m synonymous for being the antonym

Chorus

Verse Two: E-TRAIN

I vacation in Bali, Mok got the volley
At club like molly but I roll in Ferrari
Hopping out with a sack like Santa I’m jolly
Sled sitting mean and my jeans are Cavalli
Moving in the club crowd parting like Dolly’
Lama in my hand has your girl saying golly
Kentucky Derb’ boy she knew how to ride me
Plus I’m a stud I bust dollars on her dime piece
I be chilling where the cops can’t find me
Road America quarter-mile in 9.3
Whip is 98 911 right behind me
Whale of a tail turn pale if you find me

Chorus

Verse Three: E-TRAIN

Chi-Town’s finest
I’m shaking the money tree
And balling wita Train’s like facing the 23
My age is perfect
The Range is swerving
MJ jersey - city name in cursive
I came in serving but the game was purple
I push it like Kush until my faith re-circles
I been more realer than life, y’all can ask me
In this coliseum, E-TRAIN’s the black sheep
I pack heat but I don’t need a gat to hurt you
Pause a couple breaths of my raps will murk you
Louie on her ace there’s a strap she works too
And the oooey keep me spaced like Captain Kirk do

[Intro]
Mother never did accept my habits, called all my life a shaaaaaame {2X}
 
[Natti]
Yo, yo.. yeah
I’m on an island when my family speaks 
As I palm trees, high as the sun of a beach 
Right here, quite near to perfecting my speech 
But my sleeping habits on average keep me missin my sheets 
Yeah , in the studio blazin the beats 
Or clubbin with fly birds, rubbin squeezin their tweets 
Flaked on my intervention, I was missin for weeks 
On an international binge with the friends that I keep 
Then come home and roam around in my PJ’s
For three days, eatin sour cream’n’cheese Lays 
Relapse itch hit, I’m scratchin like DJs
Tracks in my veins show I’m feenin for replays 
You say free bass? (What?) I’ll be right there 
I like mine with a nice cut and light snare 
Get it to me rapido and, I might share 
Rappin makes me happy so, why stop why care? I’m hooked! 
 
[Deacon]
I’m up er’ry morning with my mind on a fix 
Fire up the mid and let it slide in my mix 
Takes from the craziness, I hide in it’s bliss 
Ride or die, protect my pride, the lioness, mayne 
and I ain’t talkin ‘bout Jane, I’m playin Rick James 
I’m talkin bass head, nigga, let the shit bang 
Movin keys, looka here, watch us flip game 
Ever since a minor the accord has been this strange 
I’m in the dark with the black notes 
I take humanity and capture it in rap quotes 
From the cellars and alleys with the crack smoke 
Through the middle to the top where the fat floats 
Let’s roll, nigga  
 
(But you’ve GOT to go! Heeeeey, I haven’t CHANGED~!)


So you think you’re bad, with your rap
Well I’ll tell ya pilgrim I started the crap
When you were in diapers and wetting the sheets
I was at the Ponderosa rapping to the beat

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

Sure I rustled some cattle and tended the sheep
But my main concern was rapping to the beat
I don’t bother nobody I’m a real nice guy, kinda
laid back like a, dead fly

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

I’m talkin, here and now
Later for the cattle and rustlin the cow
If I had a chance to do a repeat
You can bet your sweet dippy I’d be rappin to the beat

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

Que pasa amigos?  Not a *pasa* I see
Two hundred punks well what ya gonna do?
I got two six shooters that’ll see me through
That’s, twelve dead...
and a hundred and eighty-eight pallbearers

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

What I do on your grave won’t pass for flowers either

Now Kurtis Blow, Run-D.M.C.
You haven’t heard of rap, til ya heard it from me
I’m the baddest rapper in history
And there’ll be no more, after me

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

Meanwhile, back at the ranch
Santa Barbera that is
Swimmin pools, and movie stars
Well the first thing ya know ol’ Ron’s the President
The kinfolk said, "Ron move away from there"
Said, "In The White House is where you wanna be"
So he loaded up the Lincoln and he moved to D.C.

Washington, that is
Politicians taking a sip
Foreign dignitaries taking a trip
High tax and plenty Cadillacs

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

Now ya see me in my movies, doin my thing
But deep in my heart, I’ve wanted to sing
"Wayyyy dowwwn, upon the swannnny riverrrrrr
 Farrrr, farrr awayyy
 Titwillow, titwillow, titwillow"
I don’t think, that’s your style
But I’ll tell ya pilgrim, I’m versatile
Aretha Franklin, Aretha Franklin
Aretha Franklin let me rock ya let me rock ya Aretha Franklin
Let me rock ya Aretha Franklin that’s all I wanna do
Aretha Franklinnnnnn

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

I’m feeelin the groove now pilgrim
Party, over here
Party, over there
There’s nothin to it, the way we do it
Woop woop!
East coast, West coast
Texas

Every time I put on pants
I tell ya pilgrim I wanna dance
I put a quarter, in the juke’
Then I commence, to doin the Duke

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

It’s pretty easy, if you can see
Just move your arms kinda freely
Do a pause, and take a step
And just make sure the beat is kept

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

I was at the Ponderosa rappin to the beat
Tryin to cool off from the desert heat
I discovered somethin, really neat
The Duke has moves, with his feet

Da haahh... da haahh
Da haahh... da haahh

I won plenty of ladies, with my charms
But they like me the most for the moves of my arms

Woahhh... woahhh

I’m gonna rap, in the East
Gonna rap, in the West
I’ll show ya pilgrim, who’s the best
Nothin to it, the way we do it
Skiddely-be-bop, we-bop, Scooby Doo
Guess what America we love you

Da hahhhh, da hahhhh, da hahhhh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh

Everybody

Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh
Da haahh, da haahh
Da ha-hahh ha-hahh haahh...

[Verse 1]
I found love and I stopped lovin
Found God when I stopped lookin for one
Found a life but can’t make a livin
Don’t wanna find the end so I’m still here
Still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
Nothing matters anyway
‘Cause I’m still lost, still here
No past, don’t care about looking back anyway
If I’m moving on it anyway

[Interlude]
Yea, yea, word
Life changes
Ah man
Yea

[Verse 2]
How is anybody gon hear it if I don’t record it
New shit I’m driving yo I probably couldn’t afford it
Would be trapped in a hood state of mind, end up less rewarded
But I took a couple chances, now life is gorgeous
This gon change everything
Like a chatter, FEMA will wear a wedding ring
But heaven brings angels down, now watch us while we levitate
Caught the police wouldn’t see me, but they showed up and late
I just do my duggy on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Broken heart plus the rules, open art full of clues
No bizarre, rose and parks, Martin Luther always knew it yea
Life changes

[Chorus]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait

[Verse 3]
All the big things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it
Lord I pray I live and grow, please just help me fight pain
I never jump to no conclusions and always know that life change
We never thought it would show us, sometimes I just invite things
But I’m moving at a good pace, just moved into a new place
For me you live a movie when you play a role and just do it
I just do my duggy on these hoes
I’ll be dancing in the rain, soaking puddles in my shoes
Hop out the shower in the towel, then it drop that totter pole
Rock and snap a hit on my phone, ‘cause I’m gonna see it whenever I’m gone
Don’t wanna grow up but I’m grown
Don’t wanna blow up but I’m blown
Make sure it’s proven and known I wasn’t just the next rapper to be on
Young winners, we got it man, they slide in our face and endited us
She made you love and then smacked her friend and then let you know that it wasn’t shit like Tangie

[Chorus]
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait
No path, I’m still lost
Still here I wait

All the big things around me and I really just wanna be comfortable
You know everything about me and that’s why I fell in love with you
I just want you to be down for me ‘cause I really can’t keep up with you
Times my mind be clouded and I feel I had enough of it

[Intro: Hezekiah]
Yeah, uh.. look here, look here...
I got a, book of rhymes and I’m here to shine
So which one do y’all want first?
Got a line about rhymes, a line about crime
So which one do y’all want worst?

[Hezekiah]
See all y’all are students, products of my influence
First I’ll make it a cult, then I’ll make it a movement
Lyrics so potent, you do more quoting
High point of my career and I feel so im-portant
The way I put it down is so damn beautiful
I ain’t hard to find, I’m so damn Google-ble
And I’ma tell you the recipie and know I’m the chef
{*deep sniff*} And that smell, that’s the smell of success
‘Til they give me the loot, I keep it pretty much mute
Twenty-four syllables, I keep a hot coup
Twenty-four bars, and cars got no roof
Do my thing, see the bling, pinky ring’s sky blue
Huh~! I get it bubblin from Philly to Dublin
Tokyo to the Czech Republic 
The naysayers whisper at ya man, but I’m so immature
Plus I’m harder than ever so holla at ya boy

[Chorus: Hezekiah]
(So sucio, fired up!) 
Yeah, right hand on the Quran, nigga why would I lie?
(So sucio, fired up!) 
Shiiit, I’m fired up, I’m gon’ testify
I got a, book of rhymes and I’m in it to shine
So which one do y’all want first?
Got a line about... a line about...
So which one do y’all want worst?

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, I used to have a book of rhymes, way before I started booking times 
in studios, freestyles’ll sink you like a hook and line
Brooklyn kinda made me wanna write in the booth
I put my thoughts in a cigar and just light up the truth
In spite of my youth, I’ve know rivers of outgrown spitters
Considered a true musician, I’m sonnin these clone niggaz
Know tanning lotion won’t help, mistakes of a rookie
The hair on my trees orange like Snooki
Fire it up, big dog inspired to puff
I don’t call my queen "bitch", her true title’s enough
Survival’s a must, get you higher than Vicodin dust
After it’s crushed and it’s snorted, I can’t even call it
Just met your end so, I can’t even spoil it
See I’m throwin up signs like they huggin the toilet
Whoa~! I can no longer ignore it, pay me no mind
It cost you nothing, but you still can’t afford it

[Chorus: Hezekiah, Bahamadia]
(So sucio, fired up!) 
Go, they try to, play me though, they try to blackball ya boy
(So sucio, fired up!) 
Naw, cause with or without a label, you know I’ma make noise
  I got a, book of rhymes and I’m in it to shine
  So which one do y’all want first?
  I got rhymes that break rules, or rhymes that will amuse
  So which one do y’all want worst?

[Bahamadia]
Shit, since my inception in this, it’s been about business
So consistent, most critics say I’m the chick to mimic
How I flip it, one of the best, to do it than whoever did it
Real rap, I’m that, ain’t never not been it
Authentic like a pair of Adidas stock editions
Iron clear recognitions, zero tolerance for gimmicks
Be in the booth or onstage cause I’m gifted
B-Girl spiritist, soloist not a sidekick
I script, err’ single thing I spit
Rhyme sick, somebody need to throw it in the hospice
Cold like pnemonia wit it, the poem exquisite
Personify, what the industry missing
Now I conform as design tradition with skills and vision
Plus I desire to inspire whoever wan’ listen
Missus, my reentrance to captivate the interest
of e’rrybody breathing on the planet in insistence

(So sucio, fired up!) C’mon..
(So sucio, fired up!)

Oh-oh, I’m back in this bitch, baby
With a new steelo and a brand new ride
No matter where you from, throw it up, represent yo side
Peep out the dum-didi, it’s me and Boskolini
Rollin down the street with them nickel-plated chrome nini
About to hook up with my partners from the Lleyo
Sit down at the table, figure ways to stack the mail
Just another classic tale of a man and his money
Cause you gotta have a con in this land of milk and honey

[ Baby Beesh ]
Well, I don’t know about y’all, but mayn, I knows about moi
I keep a deep repertoire and keep some dank in my jar
The coldest Latin to ball, the mack handles the law
I spend a g at the mall and give your breezy a call
And mayn I calls it how I see em from my hustler mausoleum
From the West coast to the East coast, from the AM to the PM
What’s really.. laced up from the waist up, never see me goin bancrupt
Wake up and break up a bud so I can blaze up

[ CHORUS: Baby Beesh ]
That’s just the way we get down, we serve it up by the pound
We stack g’s and we clown and if you see us around
Say what’s up, partner, I’ma give you some dap
Because we puttin this West coast back on the map

Pimp with force like Vader and never paid her a nickel
Mouthpiece that have you fuckin for pickles

[ CHORUS ]

[ Cool Nutz ]
Pure bread, posted with a bottle and some bomb head
Smoked a broad out and turned the broad out
Pimpin ain’t dead, the broads is just scared
Beat your heels on the track, increase the sack
Be a trendbroker, from the womb, fuck the smokers
The tender chose up and the bread rose up
I was born to rap, secondary to this shit
If the music don’t work, I retire, then pimp
Big work, strip club dancin escort
You was perked off the E, dowsed in Hennessy
Fuck your simp tendencies, we bring street remedies
D boys and pimps took flight with Vegas strips
Burned vogues on the turf, screech and peel off
Check my trap money, get scratch and roll off
Be a boss, get the fetti at all cost
Recognize the game, get scrill and then floss

Q-Vo Raza
You motherfuckers can call me Wicked

This is for the cholas

You know who you motherfuckers are

Here to represent
Los Angeles, Sur California
It’s still dos uno tres

About that time to jump out of bed
Blood shot my eyes, realized I had to shave my head
Those that know show how nuestras calles roll
While you’re in the game ese you claim where you’re from
Still the same since the pinche pedo started
Obsorbing thoughts with shots, but won’t say it scarred it
Living it, giving it, a voice for our street
Won’t except defeat, this loco craves the creep
With me you roll with a flow that runs slow
To understand me loco, 213 controla
The streets where bandieros meet
Boom, beat, embrace defeat
Pistolas bust caps, ese we be rhyming raps
In court fools still squeal, consider them rats
That’s just some shit found and the Brown’s where we clown
This rola’s for cholas the and those bald and brown

[Chorus x2]
Bass turned up to bump Brownside sound
Let them know all around we’re the bald and brown
Men, and our bandiero trend
Is M-E-X-I-C-A-N

Se ponle loco, where we roll some putos just don’t know
We give a fuck tambien, Eastside South Central
We creap, lurk, kick up dirt, making putos hurt
These pinches locos call it putting in work
Uno saben, otro saben their pistolas pound
Pull the malditos down with no evidence found
No crees, pero loco got two to the chest
Now deceased is where that motherfucker rest
Next to his homey, packing este, lonely
Pointing and telling the judge that they both know me
Trip, two culitos, neta ain’t shit
Cuz through their barrio all they got was a dick
We hit, dip, catch a stupid slipping
Pop the clip in, pelones are tripping
Again, puro pinche Mexican
On the creep, staying deep for my Sureno land

[Chorus x2]

White t-shirt, Cortez, and my Levis
Once I shave my head I’ve completed my disguise
In your eyes you realize que controlo
South Califas con nuestras clickas de cholo
Solo aveces, but not all the time
Wanna know what’s on my mind, ese get out of line
A Brownside’ll bump it, here to prove something
Vatos from Sur California always dumping
Car to car or even in the street
So trucha motherfuckers cuz it’s on when we meet
Heat protected, I never neglect it
The fact that this loco don’t know how to act
Just strap and smoke weed to make my eyes bleed
Sin semilla, that means no fucking seed
I light it and smoke it until I choke
No feria in my pocket, damn I gotta get some dough

[Chorus x2]

Hell yea
Ya saben quien es
El pinche maldito, representando de las calles
Lado cafe

Baby, you should be havin my..
You should be havin MY......

[Buck 65]
sounds like an air conditioner, the pounding of pistons
bodies negotiating, a dog barks in a distance
crickets and bullfrogs quietly graphic
the turning on pages, the droll roar of traffic
the pencil on a paper, the wind in a chimney
thoughts in my head, hollow and (thinny?)
alarmed clocks’ sirens, the creeking of floorboards
surf on a rocks, echoes in corridors
(?) riots, head on collisions
the ringing of telephones, the cooing of pigeons
after new playground voices next door
defining stillness and starewells I explore
electrical hum of anger and fear
clothes hitting the floor, a bug in your ear
the turning of concrete trucks in a soil
trees in a forest, a (pattern?) full boiled
I can hear myself blink, where did she go
down in the hole, buried in snow
under the water, should I fail to care
I go out and I follow a long trail of hair
what if I’m caught, what if it goes wrong
what was I thinking, I forgot to put clothes on
there’s a crack in the sky, a pain in my shoulder
when I was a kid, it’s the same when I’m older
I’m out of control with a crow in a shoebox
out in the street wearing nothing but two socks
now I’m confused from brighter to duller
the long trail of hair has begun to change color
from red to jet black, I just don’t get that
the last thing I need at this point is a setback
my heart and my (?), it hurts when I swallow
I got to stay focused and continue to follow


Aiiyo GRAV, shiiit
Aiiyo GRAV man; Aiiyo who’s laughing man?!
Aiiyo get up nigga man it’s time to go do this shit bee
Aiiyo GRAV, Aiiyo GRAV wake up man
Aiiyo GRAV bee, wake up nigga
Yo! GRAV what the fuck is goin’ on man?!
What the fuck man?! Why is this nigga shakin’ like that?!
Aiiyo wassup with this nigga’s eyes yo!
Aiiyo somethin’ wrong with GRAV yo!
Aiiyo! *intelligible dialog* GRAV nigga
Yo! This nigga’s shakin’ yo!
Yo! GRAV! What the fuck bee?!
Wake the fuck up nigga!
Aiiyo! somethin’ wrong with GRAV!
Somethin’ wrong with GRAV!

Verse One:

Now often goes me like yo! here goes
That ox again sucking up all the oxygen from Earth
Givin’ birth to phat styles so hide when I release my carbon dioxide
Detrimental to your health, tonic makes flesh bubble and boil
Fools quote in coils
So now they’re strong on a power that’s god
Lay in hardly any other can fathom
Watch me gather ‘em up
In my congregation they’ll be no hesitation
In my nation’s reservation
That means I begin the mutating of a lyrical terror
All wack shit will get severed
Brain cells be in the process of amputation
All cerebral penetration must cease
I release a form of verbal death that by far
Will leave your whole mental scared

Chorus:
Sick thoughts on my mind x 7
With no self control

Verse Two:

I have tendencies to make wack MCs’ backbones break, bend
As my rap style ascends
We can rip limb from limb
Body parts get severed from my lyrical endeavors
We ain’t all in this together
Because self-made get to top mountain peaks
While all you others stay weak
See it’s survival of the fittest
So I rid dis fan of every hip-hop coal who ain’t real
When punks try to get rid of me
The result is molecular instability
The outcome from a vet verses molecule
Disperse the atoms split from adoption
So now capture my dreams and jack me in the veins
Let me enter your blood stream
Kid I watch your head swell
As the game gets hard and I bombard your brain cells
See my prediction of the mental constriction
Is the restriction of train of thought have you in your corpse
In the fact that this is real --
You say virtual reality so kid why would you battle me?
See I’m the only crowd pleaser
Your skull will finally bust and you’ll catch amnesia
Friends and family you won’t be remembering
I leave you comatose trembling

Bridge:

Aiiyo this nigga ain’t gettin’ up man
Man, Yo! GRAV get up!
Sick thoughts on my mind
What the fuck?! Stop playin’ man, yo!
Fuck that shit man!
Quit pla- man fuck it get this nigga’s wallet then
Sick thoughts on my mind x 2

Psychology and Chemistry is my claim to fame
Mixing lyrical concoctions for the brain
Through aural intake metamorphosis starts
Veins steadily pump poison through my heart
Check my cardiological expand
Forming to be on top of then mortal man
My skin transforms into flammable gases
Everything I touch disintegrates into ashes
So surpass this, lyrical mics that melt in hands
Burning more niggaz glass jaws back to sand
Scorch in the gorge of the Earth
Agriculture from these fake vulture niggaz tryin’ to feed of the land
Death by cremation to those who reprimand me
Axing out clear rouge styles that’s uncanny
They’re scared, when ever I walk the streets
My feet leave red burnt marks on concrete

Sick thoughts on my mind

* send corrections to the typist

[Verse 1]
I attack like the locust, I’m the loc-ist
Hit the studio, no hocus-pocus, I’m the dopest
Or the livest my game soread the widest
We the riders underworld soul surviving
Very dangerous if you try this it’s no way you can get caught by us
We’ll treat you like an outsider grip you like some plyers
Westside G-boy had no love in my fetal stages
Bust gages from a pee-wee to BG to teenage rampages
Outrageous I ain’t the one to step to
I’ll sting you like a killer bee and swarm like the wu (bzz-bzz)
I can’t allow myself to get tricked
Catch the virus get sick gamble life get licked
I’m too sick learned all my game from a chick
Trying to save souls get rich so my dayz is strict
Bind the devil quick, kicked like a bruce lee flick
Feel the wrath from Shaft a first round draft pick

[Chorus]
Easily tricked out here
So many people sick out here
Nobody’s getting love out
Only one way out here

[Verse 2]
Picture young solo sacked up with the dodo
In a broham 4 door with a nickel plated pearl handle 44
Hustle on the low-low on the run from the po-po
Ear hustling snitches showing picture of my photo
So on the go though hit up the will with my logo
Blue paisley rag over my face kick the door-O
Pen U C dresses up like a hobo
I want the cash flow the berra bonds and the CoCo
If I don’t slow my row I’ll probably end up on the death row
A hot headed negro catch a right cross and a left blow
Smash a chevy pedal trapped in the ghetto
Till I make a mil and move to beveley hills like I Jethro
Shots echoed I blacked out and saw the Devil
Wile the homiez stood in a group and scooped dirt up on a shovel
Tik sand a mellow while Chille’ Baby played the Chello
Repent from sin could thing be the end of S-O-L-O?
I saw a tunnel where Grace flowed like a funnel
I woke up dismantled grabbed my word up off the pannel
My survival manual reading the prophecies in Daniel
I ended up playing "Amazing Grace" on my piano
On my soulder sat a Dove rushing in like a flood
Rips dogs and street thugs- pounds & hugs a vision how life was
And could be should be in the hood
If we show some love

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I arise from the boon docks consume blocks when my toon knocks
Blow the speaker out ya boom box sipping apple juice on the two rocks
Who rocks like uncut from sun down to sun up
Run up and feel the wrath of a young nut on a come up
My games tight lost focus regain sight wreck a show
Collect dough on the same night it’s alright
Needed help and I called Christ
2 G’z for life committee ride we all tight

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It’s the lyrical miracle spiritual invasion raging
Leaving MC’s physically critical while I’m trail blazing
Hot as cajun anointing raising when I’m prasing
Grazing through your mind cuss G-hop is so amazing
Reach row spect you ghetto to the fullest
Never let go show me love come on lets pull this
Got too many deing from bullets everyday
No matter what you say it’s only one way!

[Chorus]

[EMD]
Yeah, what’s up man?
[Kangol]
There goes that girl they call Roxanne.  She’s all stuck up
[EMD]
Why you say that?
[Kangol]
Cause she wouldn’t give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said "Hello
I’m Kangol from UTFO."  And she said "So?"
And I said "So?!? Baby don’t you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I’m Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I’m concerned ain’t nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I’m all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn’t be upset
Cause I’m not a gambler, I don’t bet
I don’t be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo."
I thought she’d be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I’m a sinister trap
I thought it’d be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that’s what I get for thinking, ain’t that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain’t comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she’s an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I’d bang Roxanne
Chorus:
Roxanne, Roxanne, can’t you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
[EMD]
You Kango, I don’t think that you’re dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn’t need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she’ll take to my rap, cause my rap’s the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn’t like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she’d love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she’d name the baby Harry
Her mother’s name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it’s scary
So isn’t not every, her father’s a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn’t voluntary
His daughter’s name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It’s only customary to give this commentary
Some say it’s bad, some say it’s legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You’ll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That’s what you get, it happened to me
Ain’t that right Mixmaster I-C-E
Chorus
[Kangol]
You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you’re educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can’t resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she’s a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I’m the debonoir Doc
I said "I’d like to speak to you if I can
And if I’m correct your name is Roxanne."
She said "How’d you know my name?"  I said "It’s getting around.
Right now baby you’re the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief."
She said "I’ve seen you before, you look like a thief."
I said "Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that’s not my style, that crime I’m not related
As far as I’m concerned I’m too sophisticated."
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said "You call yourself a doctor?"  I said "This is true."
She said "Explain to me really what doctors must do."
I said "This is very rare because I don’t say this every day
There’s a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you’ll see me and you’ll know you’re again
There’s enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body."
She said "Ooooh, that’s very unique."
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date
[EMD]
Did you take her to the beach?
[Kangol]
That’s what we planned
But she stood me up, Roxanne, Roxanne
Chorus
[Kangol]
And here’s our gameplan
[EMD]
The beat is here, so we will reveal it
[Kangol & EMD]
And if you think it’s soft, then Roxanne feel it!
[beat boxing and scratching]

[Intro]
Ay! ay! Teach me how to dougie (ay!)

[Verse 1]
They be like Smoove (what?) "Can you teach me how to Dougie?"
You know why? Cause all the bitches love me (ay!)
All I need is a beat that’s super bumpin
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it (get it)
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon’ be on you when they see you hit that Dougie right
Ain’t nobody fuckin wit my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder (okay)
I ain’t from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now e’rybody tryin to do me (they jockin)
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryin to screw me
Now you just do you, and I’ma do me (all day)
Niggaz love to hate, so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

[Chorus 2X] + (female)
(Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie)
(Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie)
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain’t fuckin wit my Dougie

[Verse 2]
The name is Young (yup) for them dudes who don’t know me (ha ha)
I know I’m from the West but I can teach you how to Dougie (yessir)
I step up in the club and, all these bitches bug me (who you?)
On a nigga dancin, and none of them know me (ha ha)
I hear this crowd screamin like "Aye get it Brodie!"
So I’m on my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, "How he do that? He can Dougie on the flo’"
And when that nigga stop they like, "Dougie some mo’!"
I’m like, "a nigga kinda tired" then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone! Show these cats how to do dat
Down South dance that we learned a lil’ too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew ask

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Back of the party, I don’t really like to boogie
I’m just tryin to get bent and meet a thick redbone (hmm)
She do her Dougie and all them bitched hatin
But I’m ‘bout to act a skateboard a bitch and head home (fuck you)
She got her friend so, it’s a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long (yup)
She like "You hubby," I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don’t give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff’ in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gon’ make ‘em to the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
DAHHH, bitch you can’t tell me nothin
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin (oh!)

[Chorus]

[Intro: Krayzie Bone] + (Ya Boy) + (Ray J)

Krayzie Bone, Amiratti,it’s The Life...Let’s Go

(Ray J)
Ray J, Knockout!

(Ya-Boy)
Rocka!

[Intro Bridge: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let’s see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

[Krayzie Bone]
I’ve never been this high before,levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more,drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I’m floatin’ through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition,did I mention
We go hard,and we don’t even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin’, we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone,mindin’ my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You’re on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I’m in the sky you ain’t even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin’ you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin’ you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin’ you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona’ fry
And it ain’t no lie
Ghost sittin’ low and my bitch real high
And it ain’t no lie...

[Ya - Boy]
Look up in the sky it’s a bird, it’s a plane
Half a pound of herb to the brain
On a highway in the sky, I swear to God I might swerve in the lane
I’m high and that won’t change, smoke that bomb Saddam Hussein
Bitch meet me on that cloud, go ahead and climb that crane
Who the flyest of em’ all?
Who the highest of em’ all?
They call me Rich Rocka, I grab a pile of hundreds in case I fall
Might find me in a Lamborghini, with a light skin bitch in a tan bikini
Got my mind in a whole another world trying to jump up on tryna’ trampoline me
I’m smokin’ the ganja green leaf,so high can’t no one see me
Nigga I can fuck any bitch,we gon’ skinny dip and smoke some seaweed
I’m high like Krayzie Bone
You understand?, okay we gone
Get high, don’t say we don’t
Pay the dopeman, I don’t pay these hoes
She still wanna’ try me though
Wanna know what kinda’ high we on
That’s a hybrid I’m highly on
I’m bout to hit it like a xylophone
I’m like E.T.- (phone home)
Eyes tight - (Hong Kong)
She lickin’ on me - (snow cone)
I’m outta’ here (so long)...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin’ you can get as high as me,I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin’ you can get as high as me,I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Bridge 2: Ray J]
I heard you claimin’ you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...(X2)

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin’ you get real big
I’m about a dollar, what the fuck’s fifty percent
I ain’t into goin’ half, I’m payin’ the whole rent
Whole crib hot boxed like there ain’t no vent...

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see,I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let’s see,I doubt if they can go higher than me

Get high, get high, get high,get high, get high (X2)

Yeah
Check it out

If you’re fake, you’re fake
If you’re whack, you’re whack
If you’re hot, you’re hot

Most you rap cats don’t appeal to me
Lot of y’all think say you keep it real, but y’all ain’t real to me
Mack 10, Ice Cube, WC
Y’all niggas make me laugh, double long on WB
Coolio, you so whack you disgust me
Most rappers on the west coast don’t even like you--trust me
And E-40 I gotta talk about you
You’re styles are so annoying, I just wanna smack the shit out you
And Snoop, I don’t know where to begin
It should be a sin to be a millionare and be so thin
But on the real, when you first got a deal, you was the man
I swear to God Snoop, I used to be your fan
What happened?
Now everything you make SUCKS
Now you’re just all these other commercial dumbfucks
MC Ren, I respect you kid
But your style kind of died...when Eazy-E did

(Chorus)
If you’re fake, you’re fake
Real niggas know
If you’re whack, you’re whack
Real niggas know
If you’re hot, you’re hot
Real niggas know the truth, real niggas know the truth
(Repeat all)

Foxy Brown, who the hell gave you that name?
I saw you in Harlem, you looked like a dude--fuck game
It’s a shame trying to gain fame as a hoe
You’re the same as the other hoe
But came in the game for the dough
And NORE, I never liked you and Capone
But I can’t front on your album, you sound better alone
And I don’t really mean to diss you cuz you really seem cool
But most of your rhymes sound like you never finished school
DMX, no doubt you got raps own
But the way you stress you’re the best, your head’s a little to blown
You kill me with all that dog barking gimmick crap
But KRS-ONE already put a song about gimmicks on the map
Canibus, you red hot 97
On a scale of 1 to 10, we all said 11
DMX got a 9, NORE a 6
I’m glad you left Wyclef alone, cuz you cats didn’t mix
Mase, you came in with DMX and the Lox
But now, you sound more R&B; then Deborah Cox
You represent Harlem, but Harlem don’t respect you
And if those rumors are true, you better get someone to protect you

(Chorus)

Will Smith, now you know damn well
The only air you belong on is the one in Bel
Even though I don’t like you, I don’t hate you
I hate when award shows let you win, none the less nominate you
Onyx, I love y’all, but I gotta pull your car
You gotta be soft, cause you act too hard
Big Daddy Kane, I get raw off the ?? but you sold
When you came out with that black, beautiful and the bold
You hurtin, and most of your fans 
I’m glad you’re back out keeping it real, please keep it in your pants
Charli Baltimore, you need more then just luck
Cause you suck, and I really mean you suck
Cam’ron, your first joint was off the hook
And I liked a lot of songs off your album, but look
Horse and Carriage fucked me up, that shit was whack
And the remix had nothing to do with that track
But I don’t blame you, believe me, I know the game
Record labels hardly give creative control and it’s a shame
Look at McGruff his album was aiight
But the cats he signed with can’t even push his shit right

(Chorus x2)

If you’re fake your fake,
If you’re whack you’re whack,
If you’re hot you’re hot

If you’re fake you’re fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake (fade until end)

J is for the way I jam
I jam on it

Pump your fists

B-boys and b-girls
Get into it
Were starting from scratch like
So you oughta react like
That’s that shhh
That’s that that yo
See that feedback need that thank you
Motion scripture
Verse one takes two

Takes you on bizarre rides
The far side is reached
Car rides with your peeps
Your mind is unleashed
No time to second guess what’s next
Tongues flex like b-biceps
Push downs, triceps
Skull crush your fly reps
Spot rushing with a brother named Jayem
Making miraculous mayhem
Got to play them in Heavy ro-rotation
Watch your spacing
Some elbowroom is required
Perspired over bridges I never had to cross
Desired many highs, led to memory loss
Realized freedom can carry a very high cost
Decided to work for me so you know who’s the boss

Working for me?
I’m working for you.
Feeling for me?
I’m feeling for you
You’re feeling for me?
I’m feeling for you
I feel, I feel, I feel
Feel like I got the
The whole world in the palm of my hand
And I’m just riding the vibe
Like mass trans-it’s crazy
One CD, y’all love me
If my sophomore joint flops
It aint so lovely
Oh well
I guess for success you have to fail
My third joint will be booty music
Because that’s what sells
No, for real
You know the deal
I’m playing with a stacked deck
On some real hard work type
Type to make your back sweat
So get involved
Throw your fists if you’re into this
For you nonmotivated wallflowers
I’m photosynthesis
Come off the wall before I come off on y’all
Have you saying
For a third grade teacher he’s awfully raw
Come off the jaw without a thought or a flaw
Rock the house whether sticks, stones, bricks, or straw

Awww yes!
The stress free remedy
Letting the good vibes from inside come outside
My side is your side, eastside to westside
Reside on the same Earth
Same turf, same dirt
Same smirk when that same jam comes on
Same eyes roll when we know they’re doing it wrong
Doing it strong for those who’ve been listening long
Listen, learn we aint no nerds, aint wasting our turn
We aint concerned with your game plans
We’re plain man
But don’t be doubtful about the game stance
Take a chance, storm the stage with a rain dance
Hit the fans
That’s that shhh, that’s that shhhh

I’m captivated by the BOOM-CLACK
BOOM-BOOM-CLACK
There’s too few emcees and crews just do rap
And choose to use slack
I fish with a tight line
A spiritual millionaire with infinite lifelines
Give me the 50/50 if only half of y’all are with me
Maybe you can phone a friend and bring the audience to fit we
C-G!
Feel us
It’s up to you, break the mold of the old
Step into something new
The t-t-type to put love where’s it got to be
Feeding off your energy
Reci-reciprocity that’s the best philosophy
Like an S apostrophe
The world belongs to us!
Community!
Can you and me get down-down, do it-do it

We’re doing this for emcees around the world
B-boys and b-girls get into it
We’re starting from scratch like
So you got to react like
That’s that, that’s that, that’s that

Hit the club, back to my mission
Same type of sippin’, niggas ain’t no different
It’s easy pimpin’ if you see us in it
Four Jeeps get (???????)
It’s gold and white labels, no brads at this table
Yellow and green bottles, you know what that mean? y’allin’
Know you got to drop if you cop a skwat
This shit goes no further then the parking lot
Burns a tab (???????) back to your pad
Be lucky if a broad drop you mad to the lab
After that we stab, look backwards and laugh
take a bottle in the air
Two fingers, that’s how a playa bounce

[Verse two: Cha Cha]
You might ketch me in Bahamas, when I’m loungin’ wit him
Tell him bring the Condoms wit him, like he gon hit ‘em
Know I always liein’ a little, bullshit him
Tell his ass lye on the pillow, let him feel ‘em
Pop dom wit him, and roll up (?) wit him
Create bonds wit him, but I don’t wined up wit him
I just stack my cake, hair back to the states
Know it’s two case, like "Oh yea, by the way..."
I’M A HUSLA BABE
And you just got played
Thanks for the trip, I just got payed
That’s what you get, tryin’ a hotel
Sees-po-lease
I tax for the stress when it’s (?) to invest
Wynnin’, we kissin’ (?)
Why we can’t undress?
That’s when I lie
"It’s not you, it’s the PMS"
I reverse the game
You should rehearse the same
I always dig at your nollage
So I dig at your wallets
This is how 

[Hook] X2

[Verse three: Cha Cha]
These niggers deserve Oscars, better yet Grammies
They all sing the same damn song for the panties
From Mike, Donald and Danny, down in Miami
To Nate from Pinstate
Even California Randy
And DJ like (?) from New York and L.A.
He from around D.C. but be in V.A.
So, from Cha-City to Detroit Rock City
They all say the same lines
(???????)
Get it

El negro calde con dj goldi

Una vez cuando sal\xc3\xad a darse mi presentaci\xc3\xb3n
Una dama elegante secuestro mi atenci\xc3\xb3n
She really have a curico body and different stubby
Full of glob da ina como noby
Una quinta rueda pa fuera mucha mucha miradera en el gato de ella
Alegando y manoseando en la cara mia
Con un disfraz de un tama\xc3\xb1o que ni le servia
Le explique que lo sent\xc3\xada, que no sabia
El era quien ganaba, yo perdia
El continu\xc3\xb3 y yo ay bendito sea Dios
Este mamabicho ya me canso
Y le dijo en el oido, yo vivo positivo
No tengo problema, no tengo enemigos
Tirala conmigo donde no haya testigos
Si eres tan atrevido a fueguillo sin gatillo
Nadie aplaude martillo, dijo, se puso amarillo
Gaco como Juaniquillo
Le dijo a su gata, quedate con mi amigo
To lo anterior fue un mal entendido
El si decidi\xc3\xb3 con ella por si volv\xc3\xada arrepentio en la habitaci\xc3\xb3n 4 cinco del ejecutivo
Esto fue solo un aperitivo, sacado de lo vivido
Cualquie nace pal chivo
Si no respeta tu prieta al de la maleta
No es culpa del toro, su bate es inquieta
Hey no respeta, demasiao coqueta, oye, hasta la vista mu\xc3\xb1eca

A mi me gusta hacer music elegante de boutique
C\xc3\xb3mprate el CD, se bot\xc3\xb3 mi d jockey
Hice algo sweet pa la lady something crazy
Nac\xc3\xad de este baby, olor a melsi conmigo
Mi ritmo a ti te lo quita to
Sueno de la disco hasta el motel
Sueno en la prisi\xc3\xb3n y en el burdel, oyeme bien
Mera mera que no diera yo por tener una nena como tu en mi gru
I sleep with you like glue
Amagu son fucking como el bugal\xc3\xba
Pa demostrarte mi gratitud, vamono a jui biu
I’m coming trough old school like Kong-fu
Bien cotizao como un BMW
Tengo buena salud, el rebolu no esta en mi menu
Y yo con propia luz frio como un igloo
Pues mujere como tu existen donde on qu
Pa los cualtucu las gatas los dejo puyu
Got the blues, got the juice
Vamu su a bad move
A ver si mi Jes\xc3\xbas si que no no baje de la cruz
Es Tego Calde, con dj goldi
El enemy de los guasibiri, el abayarde
Que fue, buscando una gata que no pelee cuando llegue tarde. Oye!
A mi me gusta hacer music elegante de boutique
C\xc3\xb3mprate el CD, se bot\xc3\xb3 mi d jockey
Hice algo sweet pa la lady something crazy

[Verse]
You know I’m off blast, you face off fast

And ride that dick non stop till it drop

Come over here man, and show me what you got

[Chorus]

Lay you down and undress you, red light special
You wanna bring your toy friend, I just might hit you

[Chorus]

[Outro - to fade]
Girl give me that now now now, now now now

(CHORUS)
Legal murder, legal murder
Doin thangs, doin thangs people never hearda
Legal murder, legal murder
Doin thangs, doin thangs people sometimes hear-a

Murder, the end of another life
By a drunk in a car, or a gun fight
Now thats wrong but the bullshits right
And day by day, we losin more babies lives
Or take another son and send him to a war
To operate a tank, held a chainese and drive a car
And when he get knocked in the rocks
A metal, no money and a God damn box
Or his name on a local station
What good is that when you’re on vacation
For good, you’ll be missed in your hood
Cause in Iraq, ya break ya back
And still hafta pay for the gas when ya bring yo ass back
Or come back disabled
Your family looks at you to put food on your table
Open the door, there’s no food in the fridge
So now you go crazy and jump yo ass off a bridge
And the suburbs is heard of
Its an example of a...legal murder

(CHORUS)

A white cop on a witness stand
He panicked, shot a brother so they called him a dope man
And the public has to take it
Because the only thing we know is whats wrote in the paper
Yo, but let it be the other way around
Let it be the ‘wood with his ass on the ground
And then they wanna take action show affection
Lay a brother on a table and inject him
Or maybe spend the rest of his life in jail
With the world the way it is, is there really a hell?
But the pig hadda badge so society makes him right
To take a brother to jail and beat his ass all night
Or pull him over on the freeway
And blow him away for the things he had to say
And when they ask him why he shot a man without a weapon
He’ll just say he felt his life was threatened
And the ghetto’s is heard of
Its an example of a...legal murder

(CHORUS)

Ya go to the doctor he prescribes ya morphine
You used to be a patient but now you a dope fiend
The women turnin tricks for rocks
And the brotherman will take everything ya got
Now I know I’m gettin deep
But the message I kick is for the people from the street
Now the doctor’s a dopeman but he does it classy
Insteada sellin on the corner he slangs from a practice
But he’s a family man, a doctor, an M.D.
So he’s overlooked by society
He’ll just set another fiend on the loose
Some pack a nine, some pack a duece duece
And won’t think about pullin that trigger quick
Then bust a cap in yo grill to get the next hit
Or break into a house and beat a lady down
And won’t remember when the high comes down
While ya doctor’s eatin shrimp and steak
Ya gotta old lady dead and a brand new cell mate
And the ghetto’s is heard of
Its an example of a..."example of a what?" legal murder

(CHORUS)

Legal murder legal murder...abortion
Legal murder legal murder...suicide
Legal murder, legal murder...the electric chair
Legal murder, legal murder...child abuse
Legal murder, legal murder...police brutality
Legal murder, legal murder...D.W.I.
Legal murder, legal murder...pawn shops
Legal murder, legal murder...pork chops

(CHORUS)

Legal murder, legal murder...world war
Legal murder, legal murder...oh my Lord

(CHORUS)

Legal murder, legal murder Legal murder, legal murder
Legal murder, legal murder Legal murder, legal murder

Doin thangs, doin thangs, people always hear of

Alright, okay

I arise in the morntime and cut through fresh books
Put them old Bruck trainers on my foot
For I am the picky mystic, I max the most
Drinking ginseng tea, eating huddle bread toast
While my skeet nags, jacks up my coat
She don’t like the smell of my smoke
She says my eyes dem is red
And I need to go and fix up my head
Honey, my head is fixed
I’m getting deep with my purpose
Synchronizing to the mystics of cosmic energy
My specialty be to write buff raps
Weakhearts, they hate me like my name was poll tax
I don’t part for none, I be the Godsend, God gifted
I work nuff shifts turning a penny to a pound
>From a pound to jacks, from a jacks to a score
My brainwaves is twisted, my tactics is raw
Cause I

[Chorus 2x]
Grip my teal boom as hard as I can
So I can find me a path through the sinking sands

[Sober Now]
Shit’s hit the fan but I’m not the fan the shit’s hit
It’s the man with the bad arse bitch in town
Put her into the circles but she tore them down
And I frown, but in my heart I know it’s all good
So I stick around like a true friend should
And they say that some things in life can’t be really mended
But only time will tell how well you and your spark prevail
Try not to implore to the stereotype factors
That they brand us with cause there’s enough love to give
Oh, Lord! What’s happening to me?
All these situations I’m checking with intense scrutiny
I need to slow down there and hold the horses
And just concentrate on paving the right courses
So, so, so, so, so I

[Chorus x3]

[Roots Manuva]
Putting the reins on the joke ting in rap ting
We be inner city sorcerer rebel types, we roll!
Snowball effect planet wide
Diving and ducking, constantly rucking with the devil
Actions speak so we get active
Roots-fi perspective holds my mental in position
I supervision coach my decision
Cause there’s may routes to take, much money to make
I fight not to buckle under pressure
I’m on a quest, got to find that real self
Uno priority be wealth in the mental
Cause nothing down sweet like the feeling I reap
When I plan with my peeps and them plans come together
Strong and cold-sheist, them coast the ill weather
I weren’t supposed to be but still am
Vibes catch a hold of my mind, I write jams
Take it to the mans dem for the \xc2\x91instant rewind’
If I gets no rewind still I pay fools no mind
Cause Hylton Smythe never took no bribe
I be independent, my jacket stay stinking
Nuff of them be thinking that the smile’s off-key
They’re right, I’m full of mad eccentricities
I believe in the power of the G-o-d
While nuff of them be burning their obeah candle
I strap on my sandal and walk like Jesus

[Chorus 4x]

he biggest difference between Jesus Christ
and ethical and moral teachers who have been deified by man
Is that these moralists came to make bad people good
Jesus came to make dead people live!

Man, first thing’s first
The covenant was made, is was painful and hurt
The savior was slain but He raised from the dirt
Now, I’m covered in His blood and there’s stains on my shirt
He conquered the grave now my faith is secure
Cuz my God’s still alive, I await His return
So people think they safe cuz they stay in that church
But if they only knew it was by faith and not works

By His grace and His mercy, the Father
He take a sinful man and make him something outa nada
He washed away the dirt that I (get)[?] when I tried to
Satisfy my thirst outside the living water
Oh what a great mistake, I wasted so many years
I tried to do it my way instead of doing His
That’s probably why I (ceased[?]) the salt from my tears
But now I be the salt of the earth to my peers

Sin brought me so high but when I came down
There wasn’t enough (finally[?]) to keep my mind sound
I wanted all the hotties to compare to peace of mind
But there wasn’t one hot enough to give me peace of mind
I wanted fast money but when I finally got it
The only thing that was filled was my front pockets
I blew all my cash on the kicks and the summer (get[?])
By the time I got home I done got my eyes on another pair

Never satisfied in the pleasures that’s fading
Cuz I can’t take them to the grave, man
(From babes[?]) to the stacks of the paper
Now I only put my faith in the Savior

It only makes sense
I really don’t care if I never make a cent
If my pocket’s full of lint I can still sleep well
Cuz the God of the universe know me by my covenant

He always save me
He ain’t take a bad man
Try to make a good man
He just took a dead man
Then He let him live
He told me "get up and walk"
He told me "get up and walk"
He told me "get up and walk" so I did

He saved me
He ain’t take a bad man
Try to make a good man
Nah, He took a dead man
Then He let him live
He told me "get up and walk"
He told me "get up and walk"
He told me "get up and walk" so I did

[Talking]
Man is not just unethical, he is lost and dead

If man is only lost in guilt, what I have given to you is bad news
But he is lost in sin, and our great privilege is to tell him we have a savior...

1 - \tIt’s like Romeo and Juliet
\tHot sex on a platta’ just to get you wet

\tIt’s like Romeo and Juliet
\tHot sex on a platta’ just to get you wet
\tYou’s about to get in somthin’ you will never regret
\tAnd it’s gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
\tYep!

Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind

Usually I don’t play it that close
You got’s to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain’t got no love
For nobody else but you

Cuz you’s my boo

My love be true
So do you know where you goin’ to 
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end

No time for trickin’
You who I’m pickin’
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin’
I’ll treat you like my king
Cuz you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I’m loyal, escape with me

Come over to my place
I’ll teach you a few things in love makin’
Now I can’t wait, I won’t wait
So take me by my arms and rock me baby
Cuz I’mma always and forever be yo lady

Repeat 1

After our first night
You discovered who’s the bombest mommy
L.A.’s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We’re sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe

They’ll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don’t have to worry ‘bout me
On the creep
And I don’t want you ever to try to 
Play me cheap

Cuz I don’t sleep around
Because it’s sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homie Eazy
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don’t tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I’m feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I’m getting sleepy
But I’mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowards
So we can not be playa hated

Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin’ around
Then I’m gon’ have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it
I’m puttin’ all my sista’s up on game
So whyn’t cha’ peep it

Repeat 1 until fade




Pep had to step, she’ll be back in a sec

But in the meantime, I like to have sound check



One-two’s what I say as the record gets played

For a little bit to make sure it stays on track

The wax can’t be scratched unless Spin is there

So she can catch it on time so then I can rhyme

The vocalist on the mic is me



I’m the short and sexy one in effect

About to bring it to you straight up, wait up

You ready?  Huh, it’s time to pay up

The capital S gonna spot

I’m here to wreck shop [Salt, where’s Pepa?]

Yo, she’s at the next stop

So all aboard, grab a seat and get set

Spinderella, start it up, now let’s check

Overdrive, rhyme after rhyme, I’m still the best

I’m holdin’ down camp keepin’ punks in check

So snap out of it, me the soloist for what?

Salt and Pepa with mics, Spinderella with cuts

Let’s get paid, get paid



Yeah, comin’ in and goin’ in, growin’ in and throwin’ in

We got the flavor, and everyday we’re showin’ it

So just stay back cuz Salt ain’t takin’ no fronts

Cuz I’m dope, I look good, and I’m paid to be blunt

Reigning supreme, all hail the queens from Queens

You think it’s def now?  Wait till Pepa steps on the scene

So petty rappers take a seat, make sure you sit up straight

The name Salt and Pepa, the year ‘88

Let’s get paid, get paid



Doin’ the chores on behalf of my partner

Like money in the bank so thanks, now I’m a spark of the ashes

Strike the match, light the fuse

Spinderella, me, and Pep singing the Get Paid blues

To the petty I’m like a machete making confetti

Cuz you don’t see Pepa, punk, step up, you still ain’t ready

You want a piece of what the Salt releases?

Take a chunk, punk, and now you’re leaving in pieces



Step left, jet poo-putt-putt in your Nova

Before you thought, think again, you won’t get over

With a clover, four-leaf, chief, to be brief

Yo, Pepa hurry up and come and get a piece of this mic

Cuz I’m hoggin’ it, Holmes start loggin’ it

They wanna know do I rock?  Salt be doggin’ it

Shakin’ and bakin’ the mic just like a chef

I’ll rock this beat until there ain’t none left

Let’s get paid, get paid

Let’s get paid, get paid



If I run out of breath, I take a pause

If Pepa’s on stage I say "Go for yours"

But if she ain’t then this mic I’m minin’

I say "Spin, drop it" and keep rhymin’

When Pepa comes back she’ll say "Salt, chill"

Grab the mic, and go for the kill

But you’re lucky cuz she ain’t back yet

Relax, men, you’re a nervous wreck

Wipe the sweat off your face and stop panickin’

You look scared, stiff as a manequin

But still you’re back again to see me rap again

Spin, cut the final hit, let’s just pack ‘em in

Cuff ‘em and stuff ‘em, they know I still love ‘em

If they can’t stand the heat well then chuck ‘em

Salt and Pepa, Spinderella came here to tell ya

Let’s get paid, get paid

Let’s get paid, get paid

Fingernails, toenails, hair and makeup
Studded up my ear with a pair from Jacob’s
New faced, dudes chase, mommie lookin’ too laced
Honey’s iced feelin’ like they killin’ with the screw face
Me and my crew stay loose off that great goose
Order bottles of Velvi with cranberry and grapefruit
Where’s the sex kitten? (grrr)
Start chillin’ with stars
And fuck the bars puffin’ cigars

[Verse: Blu Cantrell)

Runnin’ kinda late I can’t wait for you
Gotta have my hair done and my nail done, too

Keep in mind that I don’t have all day
Gotta hurry up before the night slips away
Dontcha, dontcha, dontcha know...

[Chorus: Lady May and Blu Cantrell]
Round everybody up
Hit the club and tear it down
If you’re up against the wall, then you’re in the wrong place

The most glamorous, I’m not your average
So if I holla, "holla back youngin’" like Fabolous

[Verse: Blu Cantrell]

So we can dip on this journey of ours
Call my homies just to see where they are
And know that rollin’ out (dontcha, dontcha, dontcha know)

[Intro: Krumbsnatcha]
Just in case y’all niggaz ain’t understand what the fuck’s poppin’
Wolves, Theodore Unit, hey!
That’s how we doing it baby, yo

[Krumbsnatcha]
Rap’s pharaoh in the latest apparrel
Plus out my barrel, bullets fly like a sparrow
Supermen brother, I’m strong and narrow
One word in my herd, bring more beef than cattle
Ghost past the toast, Solomon you follow him
Let me splat, and we dump him up in Staten
This ain’t rapping, it’s quiet law
It don’t take too much to meet your eye of God
I’m from Boston, we don’t spill no beans
It’s rather infrared beams, in the myst of your team
Now, Lean Back, like Joe, then riddle
When I hold the semi, spit ‘moore’ than Demi
Cold and deadly, take the soul of any
Whether, young or dumb, or you old and petty
Ready, on your mark, set, go
Let your double ends up tight, boy, now let’s go
Eyes wide, mouth foaming, start stere’
All you see is, Boston and Park Hill

[Chorus 2X: Krumbsnatcha, Solomon Childs]
I thought y’all knew
How we move, always carry the tool
If I don’t win, you lose, thorough
In every borough, chasing paper, we ain’t fucking with you
Try’nna eat? Here’s something I drew

[Ghostface Killah]
Let’s go, yo we guzzle like forty cases
Don Perignon bottles, broke in mad places
Bathtubs that never been touched, we fucked in ‘em
Ran trains on bitches, with condoms, Stark up, any tuck
That’s right, if my gun empty, my bop get bigger
You see the bigger bulge in the leg of the Hillfig’ nigga
The streets is dark, standing from the car, shoot at the NARC’s
They dead meat, you see they technique, rolling through parks
There, if I gotta tell you about a real rap tale
Plants, cocoa leaves, tree popo beef, blow ya face off
Just to see what’s underneath, bet you I do it
Give me five, I can rap to it
Stuck a ratchet to ya sister, like move it
This is Tone, yo, I’m fucking with a real Unit
And your brother was a real informant, I kinda like you
You got a fat ass, how can I see you in the G4

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Burners, corrupt boulevards
TNT mark cars, bullets in the garage
Blitz, bank truck explosions
Soldiers hit, chronic in the ice cream truck
Big bucks, twenty two’s on them Tonka trucks
When the going get tough, the tough get going
No pain, no gain, the game’s still the same
Staten Island, New York, fifty hits
Bullets just appearing out of the clips
Black ghetto magic, abracadabra
You could talk that military shit, it don’t matter
Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
Back by popular demand, Sara Lee cakes and yellow capri’s
Maybeline bitch with the steams
Lieutenant Solomon Childs of the Theodore
Two thousand and four Commodore, come on

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Krumbsnatcha]
Knowhatimsayinn, Krumbsnatcha, Ghostface
Holla... my nigga Solomon Childs, hey
Wu-Tang, hey, Boston...
Out for you nigga, hahahaha
Nottz you killing these niggaz on the beats
God, you need to stop it, kid... haha
We at it again... one

* send corrections to the typist

So this is war, more blood poured from the fountain
As I’m counting on the cold hand
Of those that abstain and demand
More ground gained from the crosses that we follow into battle
I swallow in the whole Earth rattle
It was all too real from the moment that I peeled
My steel cap back
And saw the black knife fade into first light
Some fat balding man had the clever insight
That might makes right so under infrared sight
We steadily advance
I raised from my crouched stance
As boards marked the time I danced through lines of dead men
Who’ve been forever left behind and lie with their own kind
But I turn my mind off, desensitizing
I find myself surmising on how I can plant my flag upon the horizon
So glory finds me and I can be
history’s first living soul on the beaches of Normandy
And slay me a thousand Germans
Cause revenge is burning hot as pistol shot and I can smell bodies
Rotting on both sides of the divide but the tide of the battle has turned
The good guys have returned
So we succeed in the beachhead but success is relative
Relatively high numbers of dead blood stained human remains
But the Nazis fled so we advance into France
We meet the underground resistance behind enemy lines, making good distance
At the insistence of our leaders
we follow up on every lead, even a tree can be a trap
But one look at the map showed the Germans were withdrawing
Citizens were applauding
as they plotted how to pay back the citizen assassins
We started liberating towns to the ticker-tape tirades
Of humans too tired to wage war anymore
It looked like war had but a few months left before we could all rest
And go home to our families

But then we heard rumor of a place
Where an entire human race was taken and laid to waste
A camp where crazed experiments take place
And rows of corpses overflowed mass graves
There were things to be seen and turn you to burn inside
The soldiers were told to see with their own eyes
So I went to see it so I could explain without laying blame
History’s made a name of stories so I will call it as I see it
I see fit to record it so the truth cannot be distorted
But I must warn you, truth is cold
Souls stolen from right under the skin
A prison where inmates’ fate was wrapped and lay
The feat past the gates and doctors decided
Whether you were pesticide-ed or provided with a tattoo used to ID you
When death from exposure overcame you

So I walked past the gates and saw plain brick buildings
And then the real world faded
"I hated every breath:" the words to express what I saw when Auschwitz fell
A living hell, you couldn’t tell
The living dead from the skeletons enveloped in this valley of death
The stink of charred flesh made my breath catch
We couldn’t match the millions
of dead civilians to what we had believed to be humans
"How could this happen?" I asked my captain and for a moment
This proponent of atonement just shook his head
Cause it was best left unsaid
But being Jewish on the other side of the divide meant I knew my history
Without having to face its wrath
The path of six million goes way beyond the math

*I can’t understand the way you feel*

See Poland fell first and Jews were the first to feel it
Herded into units by perverted Germans who used their loose liberties
To sexually abuse and misuse in full view of the camera
But it never made the news
Cause most Poles agreed that all Jews were infected
They infested every stock-invested bank
And every government think-tank had at least a Jew or two
So who am I to play the fall guy?
When I cast my eye on the neighbor’s grass
where it’s truly greener on the other side
I must confide that I hate Jews just about as much as the Germans do
So when the burning smoke chokes out the air and all I smell is burning hair
I’ll turn a blind eye and comply
With every single lie that you make us recite so we won’t ask any questions
I’m just an average citizen
See many Europeans felt that Jews were just pollution
A problem finally solved by the Final Solution
Where Communists, Jews, gypsies, and handicapped queers
All became the target of irrational fears
fed by the flames of state-sponsored propaganda
And that’s when one man began to expand
his theories of inferiority and spread it like a virus
So Jews were enclosed in ghettoes completely frozen from contact
Beyond that flat where fifteen people slept back to back
Where liberty and property were stolen
On the grounds that Jews were the chosen scapegoats
So oats were torn and the horns sounded
As the hatred rose from town to town the world was astounded
That the Nazis would treat some citizens so ruthless
But without documented proof the accusations were toothless
And since the persecuted were Jewish
The world watched and did nothing
See hate was fanned into obsession
Obsessed by the extermination of a nation founded by religion
So a nation created in fear and xenophobia
proceeded to eliminate sanction by the state
But bullets were too expensive and didn’t kill fast enough
Plus the mass graves made it hard to deny
the use of slaves digging their own graves
So science was used and compounds were created
to make the killing less anticipated and more efficient
A pesticide called Zyklon B was used
to see hundreds of strangers into the gas chambers
Which they were told were the showers
The children, women, and elderly must have been smelly
Cause immediately upon entry they were all sent to the showers
So the world watched and somebody had to know
That six million Jews went to camp and just didn’t come home

As I stare down the tracks
where trains packed humans in cattle cars behind steel bars
The motto of this camp attracts my eye, it says: "Arbeit Macht Frei"
Meaning "Work will make you free" but all those who died inside
Probably never saw the irony
This place had an evil feeling as we roamed building to building
Sights before my eyes, each one the less appealing
A room piled to the ceiling with gold filling teeth
The next filled with shaved human hair
Soon to become some German chair and plush sofa
Suffocating stench as I clench my teeth, for what I reached next:
I saw ten huge chimneys burning gas, Jews to ashes
A whole section dedicated to storing glasses
confiscated from the dead for resale
I felt frail and had to leave this hell or be consumed by its spell

I’ve long since left but I consider it my duty
To bring this tragedy to the attention of a country
Who pats itself on the back for helping in the occupation
And bring freedom to a federation of the oppressed
but Canada must be undressed
Its dirty laundry put to rest
Our country frowned on the slaughter, perpetrated
A crime so anti-human we were all left exasperated but it faded over time
And if you think Denmark smelled rotten soon our feelings weren’t forgotten
But I will never forget that this nation did nothing
And when our government feigned sadness they must have been bluffing
Cause before and during the war all the way into the fifties
Canada’s immigration policy was just as clear as any:
One Jew is one Jew too many
So how can we condemn when we had a chance
To open up our arms and give our home to the survivors?
Instead we gave the red carpet to ex-Nazi storm riders
Whose record checks seemed to have been forgotten
at the border in the disorder
Why do you think we still keep finding out
the Nazis are our neighbors fifty years later?
Ask me if I think we should’ve done more
It’s all said and done with now so what the fuck for?

My task and all I ask is that you never forget
Cause those who forget: history will repeat it
The Nazis were defeated yet the lies live on and spawn
In the ignorance of those whose motives reap it
And claim death counts were made up as if we needed to exaggerate
But I saw how hate could make right-thinking people deviate
When they create excuses for the nooses and reasons for the bleeding
But nothing made as much sense as "Seeing is believing"
I can’t stop crying
This isn’t human
Only illusion, but I’m trying
What I saw will defy
Too many dead to identify
Cities disappear and whole families die
So when you deny, spreading lies my mind burns with the pictures left behind
Please look inside my eye and tell six million Earth citizens why
All I want to know is how the hell can you deny?
How the hell can you deny?  How the hell can you deny?
How the hell can you deny...

[Geno V]
I was crusin the varrio just left my canton
It was me, my ruka and my friend Ramone
I was lookin for a dealer to deal me some coke
Stuff runnin dry, need to get high que pa I was broke
So I took out my cuete to a vato at the store
Dame your deniero now hit the floor
Wit the money in my pocket, me fe I split the scene
Back to the varrio to see the dope fiend

He said "sure ese, jus let me see your clout
Cause I’m the dope fiend, I’m what its all about"
So I took out my plata thats cash cut in slang
Poquita cociania just enough to get a bang
Insertin la bruja I was goin to town
10 minutes later I was comin down
No dope to be found man
Come to realize I was a dope fiend’s clown
Stealin your deniero I was stealin people’s cars
Then I lost my freedom behind the jail bars
Ya page todo mi teimpo yeah I served my time
Back to the varrio it was dope fiend time

[Geno V]
My connection jus got busted al bote se lo varone
A un vato nuevo en el cito que a jaro
So I searched for this vato yeah this loco now in charged
So I was cruisin down the varrio, down the boulavard
I saw this loco standin yeah pa yado en la escina
Le pregunte a loco se endia cocina y mi dijo
"El dope fiend ya se fue, cause I jus took his place
Cause my supplin ya se cava and ya don’t have to pay"
Say what I don’t have to pay man yo how can this be
So I say como se llama and he said "its called JC"
He said "I got the high, that you’ve been lookin for
His name is Jesus Christ, and you don’t have to look no more"
Man my corazon was poundin, my body really shook
A dentro de tu bolsa, where he pulled a little book
That aint no drogas man yo whats this all about
Its called John 3:16, check this vato out
For God so loved the world, He gave His only ijo
If you believe in Him, you will not perish but lo que dijo
He’ll give you love and peace y esto no es miendas
Porque lo dijo Dios, its called eternal vida
For me, "you can make it"
Ese Ima junkie, "He’ll erase it"
Orale

[Geno V]
So I put down my cabesa as I started to resad
Called on Jesus Christ, mi pecados perdona
Bueno Jesus Christ, es que saves que
Quiero cambia mi vida porque la onda se me fue
I used to chase mujeres even though I was casado
Robando liquor stores, and some one elses carro
I was always hurtin people wit malas antenciones
Every single word would come out to maldeciones
Never went to church on Sundays, I was just a vato’s loco
Excuses not to go man, I was just a mentidoso
Mi corazon temblando un marijuano soy
Te amo a Jesus Christ en mi vida hoy de doy
Orando like a baby I was high on nalagreas
Cause his supplin no se cavas
It keeps goin cada dia
Ya mi vida ya cambio a Cristo a cono ser
Mendiedoso es el dyablo y no tienne ya poder
So all you vatos loco thinkin you’re so really bad
Get high on Jesus Christ, cause yo man He’s the best I ever had
So if you’re from San Antonio, Miami, San Jose
Chicago, Corpose Cristi, or down in East LA
No le a te donde vengas all for Jesus that is my rhyme
Porque Cristo viene pronto but you’re runnin out of time

[Phonte]
I came from the bottom of the barrel 
No name brands, no logo’s on my apparel
Played out like a Blue Note, just ask Harold
Hard times and then some
A broken home, with a fixed income
Until I started puttin’ words together
Adjectives and verbs together, and put them to beats
Records labels hear my sounds, say me shit sounds sweet
And so they throw me on the road for a couple of weeks
So the world can hear my devilish raps
California, New York, New Orleans, Philly, Texan and back
The delicate fact
Is that they show me all these chicks and doe
And I ain’t never had this shit before
So I’m wildin’, snortin’, smokin’ cancer sticks
And fuckin’ these groupie hoes every chance I get
Supermodels, gettin’ next to them
And catchin’ ease ass from white broads cause that’s safe sex to them
Now I
Travel the world and my records been played
And people tellin’ me, that hip hop’s been saved
And on the
Finest of linen’s my head’s been laid
But I get home and find none of my bills been paid?!
And that’s part of the game, you gotta respect it
Niggas don’t see the lights, till it’s disconnected
And that can have a sobering effect
It’s the rap life
But nigga, that shit can all be over in a sec
Better live it

Keep a game-face when I figure-four leg lock
I’m straight, six ‘o clock I’m on the dot
Bringing pop lock and b-girl
Turn on your gizmo
Turn it off, I’m here
Heat Chi inferno
Her lip gloss is melted
I’m the godfather of goddesses
I go down
Chi, goddam, the god’s gift to ho-town

[Chorus]

[Suede]
Just make the bed rock
At a high frequency
Slide down my sled drop
Drappin’ drippin’ Hennesey
Dive in the pooza
Lo French-mahogany
One for eye-witness
With two China’s massaging me
Pelvic sex rock
Call it sexually larceny
Burning up the headboard
And I call her head-lord
Nasty, religious
She cum in double-digits
My wand is the magic
My tongue makes me the wizard

[Chiba]
Welcome to the bed rock Academy
Knock off the Knockouts
Rockabye Baby is knocked over
And knocked down
Bedroom Bully
Ain’t no kidding with the kiddo
Just cause they kitten and they kitty
Is a killer
She like my jawbreaker
She juggle on her jawbone
Juggle it on her jugs
Kama-sutra thug
Playing with a jukebox
Musak-man
Spy-cam on tube top
News at 10

[Chorus]

[Dr. Doom]
Yeah
Yo, yo
West Coast, nigga
Crip, nigga
Better check the zip code, nigga
9-0-8-0-5, for shoe yo, check the zip code
Yo, check the zip code, 9-0-8-0-5
West side is my hood, fix yo’ hood, nigga
What? What? What? What?

Black Knights, the moder-en day N.W.A.
Cali’s finest gangster rap rhyme writers these streets ever raised
Renegades, bustin off guns, definately
If I gotta go out, you’re comin with me, like 50/50
Split decision, Doc. Doom, the rugged rhyme physician
Talk rude, bubble-goose, straight outta Hell’s kitchen
Verbal hitman, Bobby Steels’ ditch-diggin henchman
Monkey wrench men, I stay up in the war trenches
of L.A., put a hole through yo’ eniche
Hey Mr. D.J., the Knights is here so let the beats play
We rhyme for eons, way beyond your small flow
You dynamite niggaz’ll rhyme, our click is all pro

[Monk]
Divide the code of honor, kill or be killed at any time
Mathematically enclined, walk, talk with my mind
I pack metal, black gats, stainless steel swords for war
Black Knights attack, crash your coast, waves by shore
Young hitman, body ? until we master samurai style
Chop your neck, some niggaz funny style
Check my war file, from Compton to Staten Isle
I left my trademark, Ghost Dog after the gun bark
Here’s a book to read, like weed’ll leave your brain sparked
Plant seeds, caught three to seam, got dark
The final shootout, live by the code, die by the code
Empty on your half ass niggaz and then I reload

[Chorus: Dr. Doom]
Killah Cali, the home of the Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs, relax or you get hit with slugs
Dent your mug, my niggaz ain’t showin no love

[Crisis]
Give ‘em a double dose of that shit to leave ‘em comatosed
No jokes, we smoke for comin with the rumble coats
Hitman, bullets rippin through flesh, flesh
Supreme penetration, enter your back, exit your chest
One marinate, cardi-inch roast, trapped in your neck
In this war zone, seven get throne, six connect
Discipli’ incest, scorpion sting, kiss of death
In this genevese, clappin enemies, clearin facilities
You want drama? We can draw blood, I do the honor
Street novelist, pure dominence, you know the motto bitch
Knights is nothin luckin in the game so fuck bluffin
Cause mass destruction, leave bodies floatin in the Hudson
For the CREAM I’m lustin, the better thing the cheddar brings
From the get-go, we have this shit sewed, so check the zip code
(9-0-8-0-5) where cats get flipped on majorly, fuck cagerly
Thug life style, so bust this mic down
We might joust, Black Knight style, so what’s this life now?
(Yo)

[Chorus - 2X]
Killah Cali, the home of the Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs, relax or you get hit with slugs
Dent your mug, my niggaz ain’t showin no love
From North Long Beach nigga to the C, ya hood

[Outro: Dr. Doom]
West Coast
Black Knights
Check the zip code nigga, 9-0-8-0-5

[Intro: Yung Budd (Fat Tone)]
Where’d that mamacita that was just here? She left?
(Nah, she’s still out, I think she’s still out on stage, man)
I don’t even want her to do nothing (me neither)
Yo, she’s out, check it, I’ll take it like this
We come back out, Fat Tone comes from nowhere
He flies off the ceiling, cuz he Batman
He could come fly off the ceiling (Batman flies right?)
You know? Yanahmean? And just take over the whole damn show
And everything is a rap, yanahmean? You brought ya mans
(That’s right) Nahmean? (You could just stand on the side
cuz I’ma introduce my peoples: Hydro and Meta)
Matter of fact, let’s have a little rehearsal
A little thing thing going on, check it...
I want y’all... lemme hear a little bit from y’all niggaz
and see what Fat Tone is... (you talk a lot and you bounce a lot)
You see this? (I know this is about ya album but)
This is about... (Can I not introduce these two?)
Go ‘head, go ‘head, and just lemme hear, lemme see...
(Aiyo Hydro right here, you can kick a little something for ‘em)
Yeah, gimme, gimme a little (step up to the plate)
Come on Hydro (I’ma drop this beat, here it is)
You supposed to be Hydro, let’s go (let it flow, here come the beat)

[Hydro]
Yo, I’m the grimy nigga and I do biz with grimy figures
Yo, I hopped out the 6 cuz I wanted something bigger
Ten million and one ways to kill a kid
and you ask a nigga how many ways the killa did
And I’m still here, pull a trigga, nigga, truth or dare?
You fuck around and have a silver bullet pierce ya ear

[Interlude: Fat Tone (Yung Budd)]
Oh, oh, back up, back up (I’m have both of that one)
I got one more, yo Meta, blaze that
Step up to that plate, Meta
Do ya thing, show Buddy Love what you all about {Meta: aight, yo]
(Deep voice kid)

[Meta Maestro]
Yo, yo, all my niggaz coming through with the durags hanging
Jump out the truck with the gats, we spraying
Run up in that castle, what the fuck is complex?
We got the hearse outside, nigga, ya casket’s next

[Interlude: Yung Budd (Hydro)]
Oh, oh, oh (why you stopping? Why you stopped?
You not rid of that?) OK, OK, I’m feeling it, but

[Hydro]
I show Buddy no Love
cuz he don’t like the way I bust the guns in the...

[Outro: Hydro (Yung Budd) {Fat Tone}]
Yo, I ain’t even gonna do it (faggot)
(Let’s just leave it like that)
{You know what, we just gonna flow with what we got}

[Intro - Ming Xia]
Heeeey. Oooooh yeah
Hee-eeey

[Chorus - Ming Xia]
Faster Than You Know (know)
Love will only make you grow (hiiigh)
And free yoooooou
Don’t be scared to show (show)
Why don’t you just let it flow? (hiiigh)
And heal yoooooou

[Over Chorus] - UH! Yeah, Spook clique!

[Verse 1]
There’s a lotta fans sayin’ they’ll die for us
But where’s the fans tryin’a live for us?
For real, clean up the block and raise some kids for us
‘Cos we don’t need you gettin’ high and doin’ bids for us
And listen up close all my wannabe thugs
The realest warriors was always motivated by love
They used their strength to rise above the violence and the drugs
Then went home and gave they queens and they kids hugs
If you wanna be free, released from the unrest
The stress and the emptiness just follow me
Help me break down this wall of hypocrisy
And we can rise up and fufill prophecy
Faster than a shot of light to ya ground shot
Love, can help ya breathe and make the pain stop
Love, can open eyes and make the chains drop
And that’s my word - from the fire to the raindrops

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Water Water]
Yo, Yo
Some dudes are fakin’, off-stage a "wanksta"
Displayin’ they prankster, claimin’ they gansgter
Naww! All the real thugs are dead or in jail
Sweatin’ in cells, your man (?) is now madamoiselle
We laughin’ at Rell, runnin’ round yellin "(?) society fell"
With two fakes and chewin’ on nails
And castin’ too hard when explainin’ feelings
Playin’ wit’ they children, vexin’ our women
Then flexin’ as villains
I’m not buyin’ so save the nonsense
You paid to lie in confidence
A made man, but in the fabricated sense
You gotta hear with the intent to benefit
and feel when you repent
to never sell your soul up in cement
Time is well spent when you present
the love over (?) to rock like ‘em ornaments
So stop with the foolishness!
The love movement, we explored
and brought to you, Spooks sittin’ by the door

[Chorus]

[Vers 3 - Chali 2na]
Yo, these self-proclaimed kings of writing songs
Ain’t concerned with the distinction between right and wrong
Through love we face hate, it’s barely a surprise
That the truth tastes great to a belly full of lies
Mainland villains wit’ your gangland killin’
Get that same gland fillin’ from gang your man’s still in
The mic is (?) attract swarms of frivalous fans
Usin’ devilous plans, they decieve and expand
Their influence ‘cos looks at what takes precedence
Pockets are desolate, but you rock a ridiculous neck-a-lace
Competin’ with Mrs. Jones
Completes the message sent to these kids through wicked poems
I stick it to ‘em and re-inform
Poeticly (?), no credit for bein’ calm
Theoretically be at arms
And fightin’ if need be
On a mission, exposin’ the malnutrition globe-ified on TV, so

[Chorus x2] - *fades out on repeat*

[Jumpsteady]
Juggalo lives are full of complications
Are raised to survive on a street education
Always realize that there is a limitation
If we don’t school life with a fresh occupation
Without society there’s no communication
We feel a lot of hate, a lot of frustration
But we are driven by the realization
That we don’t wanna be a sheep in this population
So we ascend through the madness without a fall
As we climb our way to the gates of Shangri-La
Living life can leave your mind in a twirl
When you stuck in the middle of a mad, mad world

[Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope talking]

[Jumpsteady]
Look at Afghanistan and what do you see?
War stalkin the children and the elderly
And when you look in their eyes, all you see is peace
Because from the agony, they wanna be released
You see they’re fighting for their lives with every breath
Against famine, disease, and the plot of death
Now this was once a peaceful nation
But then came the plague that they call starvation
Now the stomach feels pain, shocks the brain
Cause the bombs drop from the sky instead of rain
And the land is dry while the mothers cry
And the babies that are born are born to die
You see the fear on the faces, dust in the air
The attitude we take is "I Don’t Care"
But I guess it hurts us more than any other
As the Illuminati controls us all like big brother
Death is walkin the nation, take the boy, the girl
And all I say to myself is it’s a mad, mad world

[Talking]

[Jumpsteady]
It’s a mad, mad world whether you’re poor or rich
Because you’re livin with the probs that you’re tryin to ditch
Whether Amy’s in the attic, your husband has left
And you have to pay for the bills of you sickly son’s death
Mentally of few, they’re in and they’re out
Your stress point builds up, you’re ready to shout
But let me tell ya a lil something, that will not work
Cause all you find out will probably hurt
Can’t pay for your rent so you try to hide
And when that doesn’t work, you commit suicide
And now who has you problems? , you little girl
And do you know why?, cause it’s a mad, mad world

[ICP talking]

[Jumpsteady]
Let’s take of for the horrors of the Gulf War
Left us in the desert, never told us what for
Some thought that they would be heroes, thought their destinies were bound
But field of bloody corpses were all we ever found
"Why are we fighting the wars", what a lot of people said
While parents prayed every night that their sons weren’t dead
To mommy’s little boy, left him in a foreign land
Said, "You’re fighting for your country, you better be a man
Better watch yourself, kid, and do the best you can
Cause one wrong move could mean you’re dead where you stand"
We finally get home, another war’s goin on
Some are saying that we’re right while others say we’re wrong
Anger turning out to our becoming outcasts
With a bitter hate and a pain from the past
No one understood my feelings of confusions
Said I was a feel, was living an illusion
Thinking of society and how I must adjust
Dreamin of my buddy who was blown in the dust
Gotta chip on my shoulder that ways about a ton
Cause I seen to much killing before the age of 21

You be smilin when I’m frownin 
You be frownin when I’m smilin
You be happy when I’m sad
But when I’m glad you get mad
You be smilin when I’m frownin 
You be frownin when I’m smilin
You be happy when I’m sad
But when I’m glad you get mad
Yeaaaahhhh

[Shawn Jay]
I was young 16 put the city on my back
Said I’ll do it I did it Albany on the map
Been +stickin to the script+ y’all really wanna +act+
Like I ain’t the real reason y’all really wanna rap
They jealous they wanna step in my spot but you can +sneeze+
The rest of ya life and won’t get the +blessings+ I got
I sold +butter+ made +bread+ plus I +roll+ wit +toast+
My brother call me +nearsighted+ say my foes is +close+
No friends its just a waste of time I know ya bogus
+Crooked behind my back+ ya like a +spine wit scoliosis+
I’m +focus+ed like the +Ford car+ +private+ like a +G4+
Try me get +shells+ in ya +waves+ like a +seashore+
See I don’t be on what he on we grown he wrong
He gon keep on he gon be gone
+Two faced+ like +geminis+ I came up wit you man
I’ll speak but I don’t mess wit you man

[Hook]

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Why is it when my frown is down side up ya smile is upside down
Is it because of my fly style is it my nice house
Is it cause I’m iced out and livin a life now that
I’m bout through strugglin everything is alright now
You see the Jag on them flats pass
Don’t get mad get +glad+ like the +trashbags+ you just
Pray and pray on my downfall
When I’m up ya down me when I’m down ya clown me
Claimin to be my friend... but really softer than the spot
In my back to ease his knife in
He ain’t got love for me I wrote a rhyme about it
That hole ya dug for me you tryna climb up out it
Ya bust ya head at the bottom now ya cryin about it
Well when around came right back around and got him
The more paper the more haters I need more cheese
Cause the haters I got they startin to bore me

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
From the tip of ya nose to the tip of ya toes
Y’all ain’t nothin but some hatin (yeah yeah)
Smilin in my face everyday like "what up Luda"
I’m just waitin for the day to put a slug up to ya
Ol fake (fake) kissers walk past diss ya
Breathe you a wannabe me (me me me) why?
Cause I got new whips and wreck em or
Cause I got flows that make (blank) +bend it like Beckham+
Is it cause a lot of money stay close to me
Or is it cause you should have been where I’m supposed to be
Well everyday I stay fresh whole fam got cheese
So I could care less what you think about me
I thank my enemies and I truly adore em
Best way to get back at somebody is to ignore em
I’m the heavyweight champ we’ll see who gon drop
Cause evrybody in the bottom know who on top
Luda

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Look I’m not a gimmick it’s not a rapper I’m tryin’ to mimic
My life move about a mile a minute make the best of it while I’m in it
Talk shit I’ll never get offended I’m so pushin’ to the limit
I can shake off 20 haters - ignore ‘em and handle my business
Highly hood got my name cement in
A treat to every rapper in the game or that seven up in it
5" 6, but I stand tall
Built for war, sort of like Great Wall of China
Hear my footsteps like Yao Ming’s behind’cha
Don’t remind me, do whatever to you, fly back and there’d be
Hell on earth for you to find me
They say we all look alike, cook alike
But they ain’t know that we all crooks alike
I changed the game when I took the mic
In freestyle what it took for you to write

[Hook]
I am here now say what you want
I know I got something you want
I am here now think what you want
This is my life let’s get it on

[Verse 2]
It’s like the curse bein’ successful
The more progress the more stressful
Don’t ask about heart, I got a chest full
Throw into a cesspool of sex juice
So my next move is to elevate for the best view
I got a few things to confess too
They say I’m famous, I don’t feel special
Plucked from a few to be placed on a pedal stool
Only to be ridiculed and find out they wanna get rid of you
Once you in a pinnacle they try to limit you
From the start of your career until when they finish you
That’s why in interviews I keep my shit in minimal
And if I do say somethin’ is a subliminal
Is it because I’m signed with killers and criminals?
It’s pitiful; this rap game is too political
But fuck it, I ain’t got shit else to do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y’all, y’all
You ain’t gotta give me my respect, I’ma take it
You gotta punch me in tonight, I’ma lay it
You gotta loan me no money, I’ma make it
And I’ll do anythin’ that I can get away with
I say what I want, take it how you take it
Media hype that I’ve created has enhanced my hatred
I came from the basement, rolls among the stars like a space ship
Face it, there is no replacement
Time you spent lookin’ for the one is time wasted
I’m too defined, my design you can’t trace it
So, give it up I ain’t bitter but
I’m sick enough to take my contract and rip it up
Plus my friends say I’m forgettin’ stuff
Is it ‘cause I failed to get in touched while I’m out rappin, travelin’, 
gettin’ bucks
And my hearts in my Miami indeed
Oh I ain’t forget, I just got my family to feed

[Hook]

[Intro]
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Show off, show off... (AHHHH~!)
Yeah, yeah!!
Termanolo-GY! S, T!
Mo P’S!

[Lil’ Fame]
Yeah, F-izzay, M-izzay, block hugger shit
That ol’ gutter shit, fuck all that other shit
These niggaz soft with them whack-ass love songs
Them and they baby moms cut ‘em with, suck a dick
Who you fuckin with? Y’all ain’t fuckin with Jamal
Y’all see how I’m up in this bitch, and I got my rubber on
If you really wanna thug it, C’MON~!
Fuck it we can thug it let’s turn this bitch into a thugathon
My street cred is good fuck goin in my account
I can get your head popped off with no money down
That one-eight-seven is the hometown’s favorite
Inhale the gunsmoke that’s the fo’-pound fragrance
{*inhales deeply*} And your LP was upset
Shoulda named that shit "Press Eject"
So apologize to your fans for the disrespect
It’s Mo P’s, and S-T, nigga we gets respect
C’mon, it’s the thugathon!

[Termanology]
You get killed quick, ‘bout time the ill spic
and my ill clique get bitches wet like Will Smith
Yo it’s T-Eezy, R-M, Gambeezy
My three-eight put mad bullets in yo’ weezy
Flow master, psycho, foe blaster
Flow plasma clear, you can’t come after
Throw half your body, in the Charles River
My squad hit up mad drug spots and shoot shit up
Sauce nasty, S-T, gun flashin
Mashin out any pussy niggaz that’s askin
Throw staples in they head, dump lead
My guns spread all over Mass. and shake feds
Fuck coppers, guns rock ya much shotters
Blow your fuckin brains out like old mobsters
Don’t gotta, John Gotti, Joe Pesci
The mo’ guns I got that mean the mo’ messy
Nigga BLAOW~!

[scratches by Statik Selektah]
"Who that?" "Lil’ Fame"
"Who that?" "Termanology"
"Who that?" "Statik Selektah"
"Let ‘em know nigga"
"Termanology" "and Lil’ Fizzy"
"From B.K. pah where we still bang Biggie"
"Right now bye-bye"
"1982" "It’s the world renowned"

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, M.G., Large Pro, yeah
C’mon, right, yeah, up now
M.I.C., yeah, yeah, y’know
Yeah, it’s that time nigga
Yeah yeah yeah

Now, it’s like a maze that I’m trapped in
Where guns are clapped, people scramblin
Hustlers are back from out-of-town trips gamblin
Three dice are rolled, hit the asphault tumblin
Trips felt, niggaz paid the bank off are mumblin
When I’m comin in, couldn’t see all my pain
Some are drained by the struggle, others have no shame
Lame rival cats goin hard, talkin all that fake shit
Runnin out of patience, hungry ghetto niggaz take shit
Niggaz need paper, rob the bodega, real as when ‘Pac
pulled the burner, killin Old Man Quillis
How real is, knowin statisticians say that I’ll be dead by
quarter life I lived, pullin my bid
So that my kids never know, bein locked up or poverty’s wrath
Sit and practice and master my craft
Took control, broke camp, halfway home
Better than when old timers came home, I can’t complain
Smile at rain anyway, too cool jewel droppin
My CD’s the answer when propped in the same way I clocked in
I was born with it, so it’s love now
Y’all are unaware and I ain’t scared cause I’m up now

Yeah, yeah yeah
Comin up sunny, yeah, I’m up now
That’s right, uh, that’s right
Yeah, to my niggaz, I’m up now
Yeah..
Yeah, I’m up now
Yeah, uh, uh, uh-uh (Mic G!)
Yeah, yeah I’m up now

A revolutionary real nigga
You fuckin up to all my X’d out pill niggaz
Double Bentleys is gross, Navigator matter shit, rhyme shift
More definin than when planes and the Towers were hit
Cowards spit lies, SL-55 drop
Bein tailed by them federal guys, honies hide
With the fellas gettin dicked down, passed like a blunt
Filled with haze, that seem to burn slower with hash
Flashy niggaz brawl, what the fuck is goin on?
Lost some are flowin wrong
Niggaz servin fifteen and goin on
With dark skies, fighter jets over city skies
Mami’s workin all she seem to think about is pretty eyes
So recognize, shit is bigger than the picture perceived
It’s a war now, please believe
All my G’s get it together we’re lost in the whirlwind
All my niggaz rise from the slum cause I’m up now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ye yeah
Yeah, now, I’m up now
Right, yeah, ye yeah
Yeah, cause I’m up now
Yeah, ye, up now
Word up son, I’m up now
Yes, yeah, yo
Yo..

See I’m the most provacative, let ‘em have what I gotta give
Epitaph of struggle I surpassed and the drama lived
Monumental thinker, hang hard, never sinkin he will
The kind of play don’t want my enemy feel
Wastin time caught up, did a white line new year’s
Celebratin later I was moved to tears
I’m forgiven, still spittin, truest vision get it crunk now
Righteous little nigga you a star cause you up now

[Mic Geronimo keeps ad libbing to fade]

Always keep it movin
You don’t know what’s gonna happen
You can’t live day by day
You gotta plan ahead
Word up
If not: lost cause
You know what I’m sayin

So many things like to winter going to the spring
The birds are back in the morning I can hear ‘em sing
Remembering when I was still in Elementary
My older brother woke up an hour ahead of me
Pumpin DMC, Rakim and Eric B
Too young to really know what it meant to me
Essentially altering my whole destiny
I’d be sleeping he did there to mess with me
We might box or wrestle to test the strength of me
It’s all love, all love in the family
My pops jetted, my moms did everything
I know we struggled but I appreciate the memories
The wind blows in the sunshine steadily
It might rain but it’s only temporary
The seasons change but there’s always February
In order in joy pain is necessary
It’s all relative like Einstein legendary
Respect life, why put yourself in jeopardy?

It was a sunny day I thought of let my thoughts run away
Yeah, I thought of let my thoughts run away
Although I need ‘em sometimes I appreciate the freedom
Cause life is like a TV and every day’s a re-run
Memorize the pattern when I quarterfy the character
See the aftermath we know exactly what was happening
Traveling imbalanced in my logic to check mines
By varying the topics extending my clan
Who want change but don’t have a cup in their hands
We got a few and expand in a couple of jams
Yo I spit in a way that everyone can understand
It’s critical, damn I’m not the average brother man
I’m not the Dow Joe for those who don’t know or wondering
Tell ‘em that I’ll soon come and my thoughts cover land
Become the one like embracing every line in ya map
Maneuver right, through the night, choosing light over darkness
I said it but reiterate it’s wonderful discovering self
I need mental prosperity, wealth
Knowledge and such, cause my thoughts didn’t wonder as much
But it’s a blessing so I’m dealing with the patterns of life

It’s a blessing so I’m dealing with the patterns of life
Electric

Remember the days of your innocence
When your world was based on simple things and your spirit could live again
Time wasn’t a factor, important things didn’t matter
And talk of politics was chitter chatter
Looking back at the ways of an infant
When emotion was free to roam and freedom was home
You can wish on a star while I spit words of imagination
Appreciating every breath I’m taking with patience
Decision making was nothing more than a game
And the only thing you had to loose is what you had to gain
Pleasure or pain, the summer would rain
And some of us was fortunate to have another to blame
I use my voice as a vehicle they’re one in the same
So you can travel, unravel through the thoughts of my brain
Insight, I give you light to see the source of my aim
I hope that you can appreciate what your future contains

The moral the song is to appreciate life
And take a look at who you are because so many live trife
So many problems, so many lost in the maze
That it’s easy to forget about the good old days

Yo, yo, yo (sick intentions)
Word up Yak Skywalker (sick intentions)
Balls (sick intentions)

(Verse 1)
I blast a page from thoughts cast away
Lettin off like a AK, equiped wit a full clip
but hollow tip bullets sent my finga on the trigga
sicka than tom green and a sinna god dressed as Hitler
It’s Yak the Ripper, pay your respects or get dealt wit
but I ain’t playin witta full deck
Sort of a prodigy, emcees drop quietly
Found wit espestice in they nose after the autopsy
Yo don’t get vexed cause your whore jocks me
Coppin pleas for detox trynna xerox the raw copy
Step to the master and peace god it’s over bee
If on an instrumental I see the bitch in you
Gimme a second and I’ll tear out your ovaries
This is the code of the beat from the low key
scientist with the iron fist, who acts strange
Got a monkey in my lab witta virus that attacks brains
But I’m immune to it, see mine’s polluted
to the point where sunnin kids ain’t enough rappers get executed
Few understand the character behind the music
let alone try to meet my skill halfway
I’ll cremate your little rap in a ashtray
Yo to all you muh’fuckers feminine like ballet
Yo take this as I dictate the script
You wanna battle?  Don’t take the risk just bear witness
and listen to the God as he blaze the shit

(chorus)
Sick intentions (3x)
Leave most MC’s lost in my sentence
..
Fuck a four five you know how I’m rollin
Trip six rock and leave the mic smokin
Balls caroded disease and unleashin the demons
poses your frame you stop breathin
till the air is pleasin but softly killin ya
No mercy god, you given up
Those who tested me before remain inferior
It makes you sick, the plague’s in your area

(Berse 2)
I spit a verse and the earth tilts in all
cause I twist the sinister add a beautiful metaphor
Watch how I manipulate the raw, sing along or bring it on
I write ya future till the ink is gone, word bond
Life is like growed tech scenes, operation stress cream
Worn out Guess jeans, hope flow and joke cluts
A million and one kids rhyme
and they all tryna sound like gold fronts
but they all tarnish they all garbage
I’m so dope you should go into comatose
cause too much of the voice will lead to overdose
It’s heartless consider the issue wit ya conscious
twice before my squadron strikes embalms the mic
causing conflict crucially, cause musically
you just can’t take the abuse, the juice is loose like Starburst
I flood ya brain witta million ball verse
and I demand your attention man
This is eons beyond your simple level of comprehension                mind bendin, I’m sendin,
infects ya straight to your cranium quick
It makes you sick, it makes you sick
Duns get lit like indiglo
It’s Yak Ballz your neighborhoods Deuce Bigalow
I leave em breathless like death kiss under the mistletoe
For real who think they seein me?
Better get a eye examination, so ill there is no vaxination
It’s like masterbatin when I take off
load of stress out on paper
Just play the drum track and I’ll slaughter it
Hold up first let me snatch the M-I
like it was helpless still kiddie in the orphanage
and make the hottest act on ya label feel subordinate
Have your dome pourest ya mind singing my chorus
Fuck a audience gods like this muh’fuckers on some shit
Yo it’s about to pour just don’t get caught in it
All you faggot deejay’s, if you ain’t got me on ya playlist
Incorporate this, shit is dangerous, contagious
My voice effects your cranium quick, it makes ya sick

(chorus 1x)

I’m having fun man
Scram we got em, this is so sick
So much fun, look at they faces!
It’s one of what? it’s one of who?

See, what you gotta do is ( ? ) at stations I’m gracin
Contest, start the process of elimination
Make a maneouvre, you move too fast to see
Who’s next up? Let’s see who’s ( ? ) decree
My strike is fatal, you feel the wrath, you’re doomed
Today is gonna be dog day’s afternoon
Rappers, I torture, teach em what naughty means
Pick em like coffee beans and show em what ‘off me’ means
They go against, they never win, they get dock-seated
Lyrics hit you so hard you think you had a shock treatment
Rappers, I pass flash by em like a thunderclap
My mic is a axe, so call me a rappin lumberjack
A terrorizin terror makin no errors
You’re a duck, so I’ma pluck all of your feathers
My voice remounts, it’s full like a fountain
MC’s, I caught em, manslaughter em while I’m countin
They mullah, then I look in they crew’s eye
Watch em take a deep breath, then step from the set
Cause my killer instincts will show in deadly ways
Look around, can you count all the heads I laid?
Lak Shabazz, a menace, a real trouble maker
Let it be known that I’m hard, I love to take a
Weak wack rapper and make him ( ? ) me
Because he looks like Bozo the Clown to me
Everything is serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

(Ready to go to war - now)
(We are ready to go to war - now)

Well, I’m back to attack, clash of a mic and a titan
I’m fully equipped to rip and totally enlighten
Lyrics are swift and smooth, hit you real, see
When you hear em, you forget all about the beat
Lak’s the name, not a game like double dare
MC’s get scared or beware because trouble’s here
You wanna battle me? Hey look, go for it
Your lyrics are old school, prehistoric
Ancient, corroded and busted
Greasy and dirty and full of combustion
What a ( ? ), what a pity, what a waste of time
You want def rhymes? Here’s a taste of mine
Lyrics I write contain a hard, def style
Yours are soft and moist, made out of textile
( ? ), put em in the double x file
Of wack rappers, they gotta exile
Call me an undertaker, I use my mic like a guillotine
Take 10 seconds to find out what killer mean
There’s always a sucker in the crowd that’ll spill the beans
So just bodybag him and ship him to the Philippines
Mission accomplished like I promised
You’re on a wack staff, I got the last laugh
I’m cold serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars

Cause these are the style wars
DJ Cee Just

(We are ready to go to war - now)

Ah yeah, Flavor Unit in effect
1990, small things behind me
Righteous Force Productions in effect
You know what I’m sayin
Cold rippin off necks

And I’m outta here
We in effect, y’all
Peace

[Dug Infinite]
Yo, poverty be shakin on every black block
Eyes get watery, from smokin crack rocks
in crack pipes, sun is down pitch black nights
They be dangerous, unless your eyes adjust
to the darkness, spark this, rugged paragraph
It’s bulletproof math, narcotics for addicts
Master science sing loud and break it down
Never do 12, sum/some is numb, pass it around
And check out manipulation of many minds
Creatin, precipitation of many crimes
(Bo bo bo!) You steady talkin that yang on how it be
It’s up in your face, but you just can’t see
Cause arrogance’ll have a nigga blinded
Rewind it and think about it, before you try and doubt it
Negative vibrations that test my patience
Them wicked-ass people runnin radio stations
want money for a slot but I don’t cater to a devil
Whether black or white, all day, all night
All type eyes open so you know I see the gimmicks
Gotta tell these shorties sky’s the limit

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The sky’s the limit when you know that you
can have what you want not take, what you want
The sky’s the limit when you know that you
keep on, when you keep keep keepin on

[No I.D.]
Aiyyo shorty, I seen how this life is rough
because I lived it, I seen how these times is tough
Fought the uphill battles, against all odds
Strap yo’ feet in the saddle, all praises to God
I know you want the good life of luxury cars
What you see is close range and what I see is from afar
Tryin to warn you bout the traps that’ll stab you in the back
You see I never kick it falsely - I only spit the facts
on how equality, strikes at the worst of times
Soon as you tryin to excel and elevate your mind
See I was blind bein led by the blind, eatin swine
‘til wise (?) got me refined, freed my mind
Hey shorty do you know what I mean, sky’s the limit
A pawn in this game called life, I’m bout to win it
It’s hard for me to sit and see you do yourself
when I’d rather see you do someone else, and that’s real

[Dug Infinite]
You keep me up nights late, tryin to put the food on the plate
In the ghetto black coal unknown is the fate
Just a stack of rocks, unrefined black coal
(?) test under pressure, make you shine like gold
Cause yo, keep it real when a nigga gotta kill
Two niggaz bust, two niggaz blood spill
Blame it on the ghetto like heiny and the weed
but I’m damned and dead, ‘fore it spread to my seed
You bomb bomb my baby’s brain with the game
so he can bust shots and sell rocks for fame
So when he get old he got murder on the brain
Only one skill that’s rockin cocaine
‘til the world blow up, that’s the brand new slang
And it don’t take much for him to pull out the thang
and let it rain.. ad libs.. felt that..

[Chorus] - repeat 1.5X

[Dug Infinite]
In every ghetto all over the world
We keep keepin it on, Infinite Chi-Town fo’ sho’

All the hustlers in the house better recognize
All the players in the house better recognize that
things are looking grimm.

Verse1
It was a cold dark night full moon shining bright
rain showers wind blowin’ at 90 miles an hour
I could barely see my shadow
sparked up a fat ol’ Philly
as fat as free Willy really 
it’s kind of chilly in my brain
Rappers get nightmares like Dana Dane man
this type scares optometrist
Plain and simple it’s all mind and wrist
on a tempt Oh my goodness could this
be the format where I’m at
in the abyss underground other sound
top ten list-erine just to keep my vocals cleanest
meanest you ever seen this incredible like the Hulk
I stay awoke alphabetical twista mista
with a rap book guaranteed to leave a 
gloomy outlook

Chorus (Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
that things are looking grimm
All the players in the house better recognize
that things are looking grimm

Verse2
Oh boy watch me throw the bomb like Troy Aikman
and knock out eight men
Goddamn shit it’s miraculous
this mysterious immaculate
history makin’ rap sheet on a beat
Leavin’ niggas shakin’ from follicle to feet
with funkanisms shining like a prism SPINK
Sparkling remarkably glowing as I think thought thunk
conceived off the skunk but funk
best believe that it stunk
Not your ordinary fragrance
Wash cleanse your mind with Grimm
Squash wash watch out now
here’s me hear me Smack
Check your eardrum 
Is it intact in fact?

[Juvenile]
Look, Look
You made me think to step in this square
We got some killers up in here
And he hating a player
Disregard what you saw outside
Pay attention to the waist
I don’t think you want a dent in yo face
Say, I advise you to look dead then be cool
You came in here with some shit on yo mind
Well me too
I’m just trying to sip something
Me & Roy trying to flip something
We chilling, so quit bugging
I’m hard, like I been on Viagra all my life
I put the dick down on some ass every night
As far as I’m concerned everything here is copasetic
So put on tight til you hope that she sure come get it
Talk that shit now walk that walk
I’ll beat a hoe in the mouth til she can’t talk
I’ll catch you at the light with the car in park
Show you I can finish anything I start

[Hook x4]
If you don’t want it
I advise you don’t start it
We can get retarded
Fuck around and get slaughtered

[2 x]
Get the fuck now
You better get the fuck now

[RJJ]
I’m in the cut, on a hunt for a hot piece
Niggaz all in my mouth
Like they got beef
Not me nigga
You don’t want my troubles
Cause shit can turn dark quick
If I touch her
Now must you just get bucked for your peeps
Cause my niggaz don’t look that tough
When they sleep and me I rather be with a dime on the grind
Instead of checking this nigga for disrespecting my mind
Cause I’m Mr. Jones a nigga with a fist of stones
Split yo dome and won’t have to get the chrome
Fix your tone
Unless you bout getting on
A whole nother level
Cause I’m passed that shit you on
Get it, got it, good, gangsta
My niggaz out here, would spank ya
But I ain’t want to go that route
You know the deal
Rather knocking niggaz off or knocking niggaz out for real

[ VERSE 1: The Poetess ]
Growin up as a kid I never understood the things my dad did
Like hittin my mother, me and my brother hid
In the parlor from the chaos, the cryin and the cussin
The fightin and the fussin
I used to go to bed holdin my ears tight
Filled with fear when I hear moms and pops fight
I never quite understood what the reasons were
How could he love my mother if he kept on hittin her?
I don’t know, but what I do know is this
Love hurts when it’s comin from the throw of a fist
And the list goes on from the mental to the physical
Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain’t cool
It’s bad enough we got it rough in society
Opression and poverty, no need to be fightin e-
ach other, a brother hits a sister, and he’s a bigger nigga
He ain’t nothin if he gotta hit, pick a
Innocent victim three times smaller in size
Head honcho, macho in whose eyes?
Only a fool tries abuse to utilize 
Phyisical force to control, hurt, brutalize
Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought
Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought
To the hearts of your brother or your sis
Love hurts when it’s comin from the fist

[ Def Jef ]
Now I want you to think of six women that’s close to you
And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em
What would you do?

[ VERSE 2: Def Jef ]
I wish my step pop would stop hittin on moms
She got bruises on her arm from protectin her face from harm
Bein done he looks at me and says, "What you’re seein, son
Is me disciplinin my woman
You’re gonna hate me for the rest of your life
But this is my wife"
And I’m thinkin I wanna stab him with a steak knife
Too little to interfere, I wish he would disappear
But he won’t, so I put the pillow over my ear in fear
Dreamin when I get to be a man I’ma stand up to him
If I see him hit her again I’ma do him
I encourage her to go, she says, "No
I love him, I stay"
"Mom, what you see in that idiot anyway?
He beats you and mistreats you
Daddy wouldn’t do that" 
But she said: "Your daddy did it too"
Ain’t that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for
Used, abused or even singin the blues for
He’s addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he’ll quit
If he’s the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit?
A weak later the same shit - I doubt it
I’m grown now, mommy, don’t even worry about it

(In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in)

[ VERSE 3: The Poetess ]
I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough
Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff
He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff
I tried to understand and got verbally beat down
But I thought one day he would come around
But man, oh man, was I mistaken
Nothing’s right in his life and the abuse I was takin
I was accused of things I never thought of
Good grace got no praise
But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart
With the point of steel
Killin me softly at his will
The big one came when I got the blame for
Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for
One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do’
Just waitin to let go
(Where you been all night, out hoein?)
He didn’t raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow
And that was it, the last hit, he’ll ever do
The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew
The only thing on my mind was payback, let’s say that
I’ve put an end to that madness and pray that
I can overcome what mentally dad did well
While I count the days in my padded cell

(Several women a day are killed by ah, battering)

(Listen to the hit)\t--> Ice Cube

[ VERSE 4: Kool G. Rap ]
Does he love her or does he hate her?
That’s what I’m thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator
It started with a smack
And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back
But mommy never dropped dime
Now she’s damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop’s mind?
I feel like gettin daddy done in
And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin
Man, I see the walls turnin red
I’m gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed?
In order for my mother to last
So while he’s laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass
Blow him up like a grenade
And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades
Tryin to cover the damage he did her
So when that fire’s on your ass you remember how you hit her

[ The Poetess ]
This is a special dedication for my sister Dee
and all the sisters out there that have been physically and mentally abused
I like to send a special thanks to Def Jef
And my sister Almighty
and definitely Mister Kool G. Rap
Peace from the Poetess

[Jane Blaze]
Uh-huh
Yo if I let you tell it, your rhyme style safe enough to sell it
But your weak flows, make me the bomb relic
Rap with Magnums like Tom Selleck
Spray a pumpkin, they don’t call me Jane Blaze for nuthin
Now save your bluffin for one of them model chicks
Droppin our modest hit, to prove I’m the hottest bitch
Go all-out like an Islamic clique, I’m on
some Jeffrey Dahmer uncut drama, like when a llama spit
Release hammers to protect my trophies and banners
To be as nice as me, need a whole lot of manners
Unadulterated grammar, femenine stash
In layman terms, mean I’m swimmin in cash
Baby got back, means I’m winnin in ass
Got cameras with no bulbs, lookin to flash
So when I breeze through with more metal than R2-D2
and see you on the low like the D’s do, say cheese boo

Chorus: Sauce Money (repeat 2X)

Get dough now, all about stacks of cake
and flow now, if it’s hot like Jane, let it go now
Still movin with speed, when you Slow Down
nuttin left to do but blow now

[Jane Blaze]
Yo I got somethin that’ll split your coconut
I know what you hopin but, Jane remains raw like an open cut
I ain’t no New York floozie
Let every baller walk through me, suck a dick just to talk Gucci
Could care less about his 600
I focus on tricks who fronted, that track shoes, bitch run it
My words slaughter, rap’s preferred daughter
Go on a spurt like the Bulls in the third quarter
Got niggaz masturbatin every day though
Hopin I’ll move my tongue around they head in a circle like a halo
Now get closer, cause in a minute baby it’s over
I come off at the clothes like strip poker (strip poker)
You just let a chick smoke ya (chick smoke ya) what’s my name?
Blid-aze (Blid-aze), point blank range, I’ll make ya brains Swayze
(Your brains Swayze) Yo weak poets, wanna test me or what?
Shit on they click so sick and still be sexy as fuck

Chorus

[Jane Blaze]
I keeps it real cuz, you know Jane name is still buzz
Suga what?  I disinfect tracks and kill cuts
I’m live type, lot of cats front like
they like to prizefight, I settled the beef with five mics
Play your hand right, I’m trump tight, slip up
get lumped up, see me when the guild points the bums up
CD come with a Phillie in it (word?) witty fillie
and silly widdit while you sound like Milli Vanilli did it
Pity you pitted your weak flows against mines
Since mines sound fifty times better, ten times
Visualize my speech, get a glimpse of the rhyme
Drop a hit with a shine, y’all know it’s time
Rap’s my duty, platinum acts better know I could
CLAP a cutie, or just kill him with natural beauty (beauty)
Who you trustin?  The one who gets strong burns
from dustin MC’s, or the one who gets strong burns from pussin

Chorus 2X

[Jane Blaze]
Blow now..
Slow down.. prestige
Sauce Money here, my nucka
Jane Bond, what?
Q-U
My click
Double oh-dimes
I’ll be dere
Yo, slow down baby
I don’t think they ready for this

Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone

Let’s toast it up to that life and I mean it

[Young Jeezy]
We in this bitch, we in this ho
I got the .40 on me now, who wants to Plaxico?
Shout to Gangsta Gibbs, he the next to blow
You should see my gangster grill, I light the shit from blow
Snowy car transforming instead of transformer
You ever cook the whole thing on a George Foreman?
What about a nine on the gas grill?
Four-fifty for the silk, pay my gas bill
So many horses in the ‘rari, park it in the barn
Took the ice up out my cup and put it in my charm
And this bad bitch with me from another planet
Stay on the satellite phone - man, I can’t stand it
Hey baby girl, hang the phone up
No talking with your mouth full - you’s a grown-up
What the fuck? Who the hell?
Flashback in this bitch, thought I seen a scale

[Chorus]

You know how we handle shit, gangster gutter glamorous
Zone One Atlanta shit, over all the amateurs
I’m walking off in here, a boss so, dog, approach with caution though
Disrespect is tolerated, that’s some shit you ought to know
Niggaz say they ball, yeah, but I’m balling harder though
Cold as the nose on a Appalachian Eskimo
It finna go down, ho, popping bottles, drown hoes
Paid niggaz with us, ain’t no broke niggaz around so
Excuse me - who is he? I don’t do this usually
But I’m too fresh to fight - somebody go and get security
I’m buying this, buying that, getting that check and flyin jet
Boucheron, Constantine, Puff like, where you find that?
American at the nature, boy, a lot of nigga hate your boy
Pocket full of money, got more paper than a paperboy
Hoes jocking, on Twitter trending topic
Future, Jeezy, Cris, and Drama
Tip say, let’s go get it popping

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I’m popping plenty bottles, like I got plenty bricks
Call me Mr. Marcus, I’m in this bitch
Super drink, super smoke and some super hoes
VIP looking like we won the fucking Superbowl
Thirsty chicks trying to give it, I don’t want it
You been in more laps than the Indy 500
Conjure’s what we drinking, faded til the world end
Never see me planking, unless I’m on your girlfriend
Ludacris, I been a staple in this Southern game
Got the best lines, so I guess I’m slinging Southern caine
My money’s louder, you rappers need to hush more
My presidents rock, my accounts are Mount Rushmore
On the island and my phone is hitting dead spots
Altoid can of blue pills, that’s my X-box
You could hate, you could dis, you could make a wish
But eight albums, and Luda’s still in this bitch

[Intro]
You shouldn’t do that, you
Shouldn’t do that, no no no
Heeeey..

[Wayne]
Dead Serious it’s about
Making money disrespecting
Nothing about it is funny
Intimidate us like you
Want we get bummy, run for
Metal and Steel and dunny

[Demo]
Fassies on their knees
Begging niggas please
Intentions is to cock it
And squeez if you soil ma

Survival is the key da da

[Chorus]
Dead Serious it’s about
Making money, disrespectin

Fall, cause us so much
Pain scandalling ma name
A riot and gunshot a rein

Fuck with Mr Stine, issue
Ma warning and then draw

The heat wickied a
Retreat, from Mcintyre
Land and Water Street
Sta da dee yow..

[Chorus]
Dead Serious it’s about
Making money disrespectin
Nothing about it is funny
Intimidate us like you
Want we get bummy run go
For Metal and Steel and

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

If you were them, you’d best prepare for combat
Gon’ be a long one, best to bring the bomb sack
These so-called players ain’t real no mo’
Snitch-hatin hustle and still we kill for dough
Real for sho’, I’m knowin that they phoney and faulty
Just lice on my balls, I cut em up off me
Now these jealous muthafuckas want me, ain’t that a bitch
Like I’m a punk and you could play me out, you fuckin trick
Must be suckin on a glass dick
I’m smokin weed, drinkin O.E. like ‘86, raise the dick
Can you see me bout some major shit or is you minus?
Small timers with a bitch-made click of co-signers
Not a rider withcha, think you’re safe, but I can getcha
And do things to ya Lynch Hung can’t even picture
You’se a bitch nigga, and I be livin in new knowledge
Cross me up again, I take your baby girl for hostage

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ridme because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

And I be down for mine, wrote out my gameplan line for line
On how to get the money, same time blow your mind
Incorporated real soldiers from the O this time
Sellin all q.p.’s, whole o’s and dimes
CDs, LPs, now it’s g’s for us
Flip the table, bubble up, cash and weed to puff
Bet I couldn’t serve ya, so I laughed, called your bluff
Give me 12 months, bet you can’t ball with us
Ghettonomics is a major plus, enforced with muscle
Mind on the mega-money, heart on the hustle
Dirty women mixed with jealous friends, nothin but trouble
Got focus, keep your self-respect, and know who love you
You don’t have to be a star, baby, no need to front
Just gotta know where you’re tryina go, and what you want
We dissect and reconstruct the package like a surgeon
Bouncin twice, raise the price, ready to serve ya

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

For certain, I knew when I made it that it’d be curtains
For muthafuckas fakin the loyalty and desertin
Put it down, flashin on foes, when I’m pervin
Not silent, I’m hard to swallow like lead and Bourbon
Nigga feel me like a crack serum, no pretendin 
Link soldiers, uncompromisin, unbendin
Do or die till the very endin
Why do they fake it
Claim to be any muthafucka just to make it
It’s my dream, I’ma take it, seize it, no hesitation
No reservation, finally ready to face the nation
Attackin like a pit was raised, now can you fade me?
Writin bomb-ass shit off of hash the sight gave me
Is it greed got me chasin g’s or just in me?
To feed me and my only seed, so we proceed
All my enemies bleed as I puff up the weed
Forever hustle till we all succeed

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

[Chorus]
Please don’t forget to tip those that squeegee your windshield
as you drive on the avenue
Hang out, eat fries on the avenue
Walk around, socialize on the avenue
Try to just make nice on the avenue
I’ve been comin ‘round here for a year or two
Seen a couple good bands on the avenue
Probably spent a few grand on the avenue

[Ricca Razor Sharp]
People lookin for a dry martini
or window shoppin, or raw hip-hoppin
On their way to the Dome
On a cellular phone, go Jerome~! Yo
People walkin for fashion or lookin for action
Uptown in effect
You got students from West Center High
Skippin class, hangin out gettin high and
High society girls goin shoppin
That perm lookin haute couture yo for sure
At the Mount Royal Plaza
You got people straight lookin for the ganja!
These are the people up on 17th
Creatin this scene is a daily routine
Now these are the people in your neighborhood
Uptown, Red Mile, it’s all good

[Chorus]
Tip y’all peeps, street sweeps on the avenue
Got the soft, cars Jeeps on the avenue
I be hollerin out PEACE on the avenue
Lovin all of these peeps on the avenue
... on the avenue

{*scratching to the end*}

[Verse 1]
Made a promise to momma to make it out the hood
and follow up on that promise to make it out for good
goin’ strong for too long, no excuses
where it’s a way there is a will like who produced this
I’m tryin’ to make a livin’ off of rhythm
chase dreams, catch up wit’ ‘em so I can live ‘em
If I’m supposed to pay for the sins of my father
well, that’s a lot of repentin’ prayin’ God forgives him
accordin’ to the system I should be dead or in prison
but I missed that memo to carry out that mission listen
word to my daughter though her mother know
I’ve been far motivated before that water broke
limit is the sky, I’m aimin’ at where the stars go
prison time when it comes to the pen and bars so
call up the warden, this here is a portrait
through scripture, yet in the form of recordin’
they love me overseas I need to be world tourin
and I want that car foreign pedal to the metal floor it
see it’s the Lord’s plan I’m just the informant warnin’
you that I’m here to win I’m reapin’ all thats’ rewardin’

[Chorus]
If it’s no risk, no reward
It’s opportunity in this world, create yours
It’s room for you to be you, that lane’s yours
What you waitin’ on a chance for, take yours
(repeat 2x)

[Verse 2]
As I listen to Marvin, playin’ on my song list
from I come apart to what’s goin’ on with
this industry I’m in survival of the strongest
If I ain’t hip hop, then what do ya call this
Shit I’m still an artist starvin
but the game mattered less when I became a father
As far as recordin’ I was like why bother
but I come this far I gotta show my daughter
That you must work smart, earn every dollar
Hard work pay off, and that’s word to Mahd
and day and night I gotta send up response to God
cause he navigatin’ this ride see I just drive
But I’m part of elite starfleet watch me fly
I clocked in to put in work, now watch my time
I’m Here to bring balance walkin’ that fine line
of reachin’ the mainstream without compromisin’
and remain genuine and try and keep it honest
if I don’t sell my soul, can I at least go Gold
prevail is the agenda, so indeed I go
I’m on a place kicker’s mission to complete these goals
and that’s real

[Chorus] (repeat 2x)

Shit done changed when the lil muthafucka nigga started makin hits now
Girlies that Neva used to talk to me, talk to me

[Verse 2: Young City] + (Diddy)
I’m a bad boy millionaire, look at how I spin my hair
So fresh so clean from my head to my feet I dont think y’all heard me clear
I done walked for that cheese, now I got cheesecake oh yea
Lil boy you dont really wanna go there

And I ain’t got love, it’s good reason why I’m rich as fuck but sho ‘nuf
Same good reason to make ‘em go nuts when I pull out the aqua green truck
With the diamond in the back, 26 shinin
What mo can I say, I’m ballin and I’m on fire
I’m that nigga that ya want, I’m that nigga that ya need

Woke up early in the mornin’
Threw on a ‘fit, grabbed my Motorola phone
And warmed up the engine to my ghetto ass hood hog
And put the leash on my brand new pit bull dog
Hit the switch for the deck and the Z-A-P
And let the 600 Watt Zeus funk with the EV’s
Today’s a good day to get my hop on
Up and down the strip while these bitches get they jock on
Hit House of Soul for scrambled eggs and a plate of grits
Raw steaks for my brand new pit 
It’s a clear blue sky on the forecast
Hoes tryna flag my ride, but I blows past
Called up my cuddie for the spark
And he told me Gully Barbecue later on at the Crest Park
Young playas havin’ fun at that
Leave your chrome at home, cuz it ain’t gon’ be none of that

Chorus:
Perkin’ off the Tang and O.J.
Checkin’ what yo’ hoe say to me
Another day, just another day
In the V-A double-L-E-J-O

Headed for the detail shop to get a wax down
But the task put the jack down, lookin’ for greens and cabbage
But I ain’t on search and seizure, and my L’s is valid
I shook the thought of gettin’ a buff job
Struck to my broad’s house, hit her with a rush job
Cuz I must mobb off in traffic
To my spot cut me down a ounce of dank, and bag it
Cuz at the picnic playas wants to choke off Mary
Sticky gooey dank, not that hay weed
And I’ma play Dr. Feelgood and help ‘em live good
Picnic and get rich, I’m headed for the hood

CHORUS

Everythang’s goin’ sharp, runnin’ cross a gang a broads
And I even saw some sahabs, but these niggas got some get right
Showin’ love when shown love, tryin’ to keep they shit tight
One time ain’t sweatin’ us, we gettin’ tacked and sippin’ Yak
And they ain’t even checkin’ us, 
we even got a sideshow jumpin’ off on the black top
Niggas figure eightin’ in the parkin’ lot, giggin’ to the sounds of Cease
Young niggas throwin’ down, showin’ signs of peace
Man, I tell you boy it sure feels good
To see these playas gettin’ together from all hoods, it’s all good
I seen some representing the O
Got some representing Sac, Richtown and Frisco
What they hit for? Playa dice games and dominos
Heffer hoes even get they money on 
And playa Stevie D is here to contribute
A bootch to the move on behalf of them dead troops
What was once a Crestside picnic is lookin’ like a playa’s ball
And we all at this

Hard drops quicker than jackers at the car lots
Couldn’t get no harder if you went to School of Hard Knocks
The grimy bitch, sometime be punchliney bitch
So don’t make me go there!  (*starts singing to "The P is Free"*)

Damage your hood, natural, spend grands for goods
Traditional niggaz know -- scream on these players like
DJ call in some mo’, invincible pretty flow
Grammar God, swing like gold from Panama
Twenty-four carat charms, with smooth cuts like Sarah Vaughn
Here we go, here we go -- attitude
spit the vocals hotter than soul food from Baton Rouge
Come, sharp-tongued like Malcolm, on any album
Some got chrome like Sly Stone, what you about son?
Here it is, here it is -- handcraft the raw
Who the boss?  Human torch any Fantastic Four
Player, I be a point guard, controllin things
In the 4th quarter, it’s all water like holdin springs

Well I’m mad n sick
Fucked up and I’m cussin
Sniffin Krazy Glue 
Drinkin Robitussin
C’mere ya goddamn piece of fuck
I wanna back over your face with a dumptruck
And watch the blood come out of your eyes and nose
Then I’m gonna drop a big rock in your bowl
Well I’m huge, you better realize that
Got three fuckin rows of teeth like a shark
Chop down your tree and bite off all the bark
So don’t you make no smart ass punk remark
Cuz I’m liable to go off on ya, bitch
You’re lookin at a psycho
Certifiable
I’ll make ya real uncomfortable
And I’m laughin, heh heh, cuz it’s funny
And when you see me comin you get up and get runnin
Coverin your ass cuz you know that I will kick it
That’s the ticket
I’munna strike and a-picket
See my boot? I think it’s time ya lick it
Ya ain’t safe in the woods when I drop out the thicket
I’m stalkin
Whenever I’m out walkin
Guess what? I’m gunna jump you first
Cuz I saw you a mile away with binoculars
Just got done stealin your mom’s purse
And we ain’t even done with the first verse
Fuck yeah, Dipshit
Am Goin t’ Jail

I go all out on a fool with a blunt tool
Swimmin in blood pools it’s makin me drool
To just think about it
Killin n killin again
Rip off your neck reach down and grab a vital organ
Of my choice- heart, spleen, lung or liver
I put it in my pocket and snack on it later
Keep your eyes peeled and keep your ears open
Cuz I see the world through an infrared scope- n wait
I see your jawbone startin to masticate
A hundred eight bones in your body to break
I curb-stomp your feet then smash them with hammers
Literally, not metaphorically or grammatically
I take away at humanity
Death is for certain, my life is insanity
My Mac-10 has a empty clip again
I reload and show you how to kill men
I swing the battle axe quicker than ya thinkin
Leave decapitated heads dead and stinkin
Cops or civilians, it doesn’t make a difference
When the Mac’s spittin, they’re all gonna fit 
Into a category when I decide to stick them
Smoldering bodies of my pulverized victims

[Dook Crapmore]
Now it time to get mellow
Cuz I’m tough like old Jello- yes
Dook Crapmore
And I can see- you’re back for more
Crush your head- and then choke ya
Don’t look dead- I’ll poke ya
Roll ya up- and then I’ll smoke ya
From the start
They could tell
I’m straight from Hell
Born- with gun in fist
Found out quick- I’m easily pissed
Doctor slapped my ass and they found him dead
Raised on dirt and beer-soaked bread
Six foot tall at the age of five
No one in my town was still alive
I killed em
Meanest motherfucker that you ever will meet
As I grab your face and begin to beat
Your ass
And steal your grass
If you’re lookin for your drugs?
I took em
Grabbed your beer cans
And shook em
Up
Then I chewed the face off your pit bull’s pups
Whassup?
You think this mellow man is all a bluff?
How can a slow fucker be so tough?
Well drop to the floor
Cuz I killed your

Mother in the Summer,
Sister Downtown
Wife in the street
Kids at the playground
When I get to you
I’ll throw you down and fuck ya
With a rugged dry hump
Try to get up but thump thump thump
I’m the Dook
Motherfuckin maniac
Memories of me, drippin from your butt crack

Slow it back down
N that was nothin
Time for me to go
With Flybot and Guy Albino
Cuz some punk we killed, I’m tryin to rebuild
Chopped off his head with a Boy Scout hatchet
Duct tape- I’m tryin to reattach it
Got myself a hammer
And got myself a nail
Fuck this- Am Goin t’ Jail

[Flybot Van Damn]
You?
What the fuck ya lookin at?
Bluh?!?!
Can’t ya see I gotta motherfuckin problem?
I’m on drugs- and I’m slobberin
I like to disembowel and mutilate
Me so hard I got a AK-48
I’m also skilled in martial arts, see
Jump kick put a foot up your artery
Har de Har Har I just can’t seem to stop laughin
I like to break shit and [***haver havini***]
It’s bafflin
How the Hell’d I get up on this scaffoldin?
Doesn’t matter
Cuz Flybot’s goin to jail
Goddammit better send me some fan mail
The food I get better not be stale
Like this here microphone
I think it’s time I pass it, yo
To my motherfucker, Guy Albino

[Guy Albino]
Yo fuck dat, and yo fuck dis
I think it’s time ya wake up and smell the piss
And just so you know who ya fuckin with?
It’s Guy Albino, and you ain’t shit
And you ain’t shit, and you ain’t shit
And you ain’t shit, and you ain’t shit
And if there’s any motherfuckers out there that i missed?
You ain’t shit, and your dog ain’t shit
I got ten pit bulls on one damn leash
Ready to chew your ass cheeks like raw meat
And when I’m through? You’ll wish you was dead
And if you don’t? Well then I’ll still go ahead
And kill you
Leave you lyin there until you
Commence to rot and start smellin like mildew
Just like a Indian doin a rain dance
I jump up and down on your head and do a brain dance, punk
Ya jerk-ass dork
I’m runnin through Hell with your mom on my pitchfork
I rain on your parade
I shit on your picnic
I’ll break my foot in your ass like a toothpick
And then I’ll sit back and have a big shrimp cocktail
Cuz Am Goin T’Jail

[Flybot Van Damn, Guy Albino]
Am Goin T’Jail
Goin T’ Jail
Am Goin T’Jail
Shit, Am Goin T’ Jail
Goin T’ Jail
Goin T’ Jail

Chorus x1
Now when I die, die if I die
Remember me ballin’...ballin’
Now when I die
Mama don’t you cry
Just remember me ballin’...ballin’
Now when I die nigga don’t you cry
Just remember me ballin’...ballin’
(born to die)

[Indo G]
Fresh out the whome, 1973
A baby boy, I’m ready for war
Now this just can’t be
Wit my daddy
He don’t love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin’ on my mama
See I’m a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Imortalize to my rise dodgin’ demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain’t gettin’ no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I’ma lie in twilight
Zonin’, think I’m gonin’
Maybe bro hoe
Was I talkin’ on that level
Crusafix on my door
Race em’, rece em’, racin’
got my heart pacin’
Listne learn it’s my turn
I’d a free mase em’

Chorus x1

[Gangsta Boo]
The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I’m tellin’ heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe’s
Claimin’ platnum LP’s
I can’t believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin’ your cheese
Whatever punk, I’m on my own
Still stackin’ g’s
I’m young in ages
Only the hair trick, I’ve been everywhere
I’m takin’ flights to NY
Lookin’ for somethin’ to wear
I don’t be carin’ what you say
I’m hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin’ wine
Wit my 6’s behind
Call up Chris
I’m in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin’ over
Range Rover we’re reelin’
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtn’ all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin’ each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin’ and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What’s your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I’m steady coastin’
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin’ shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin’ for freedom in my sleep
I’m bout’ to lose my mind
But them angels watchin’ over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
WOrd is born, they won’t capture me
I’m on a mission, I’m wishin’
Up on a star
Workin’ on a meal ticket
While I’m eatin’ caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin’ to get me
But when I die, I’m takin’ six of ya’ll wit me
Killuminati
I got my soldiers
And I’m ready for war
Check mate, rockafella
Now they jumpin’ in the door

Chorus x1

For the year 2G the rap game change for one name
Jewelz aim to slain anything on this plane
Remains are found when the best kept secret get heated
You went platinum wit a ghost writer, 
so in the game you won you cheated
My slang bang when you need it
You man enuff to pull a gun be man enuff to squeeze it
(*gunshots*) Die if you don’t believe it
Anything to do wit millions I’ma be wit it
Hats off to the hardcore niggaz FUCK the rest 
In my guess y’all useless, just talkin music
Never mistake me for a fake MC
You got the wrong idea nigga I’m CT fool
Get murdered in a second in the first degree
Come to me wit faggot tendacies 
You’ll be sleepin where the maggots be
Ain’t nuthin kinda used to beef actually
but when it’s on I raise first automatically
Won’t catch me as a victim and a rap casualty
Dynasty Raiders hit VA in the summertime
Ten Bentleys in one line
Gats in each hand, twin 45’s in mines
Snipers hittin niggaz long distance for a rate
Sons and daughters, one order you’ll be floatin in water
Bad news home of the Dynasty Raiders
One luv to the ol school niggaz
They in the jail tryin to raise us
Even the ones that tried to blaze us 
but couldn’t even graze us
See dem bitch azz niggaz y’all killin don’t amaze us
Y’all slobbin I’m spittin wit a mouf full of rage
(DIS MY NIGGA JEWELS REPRESENTIN BAD NEWS
YO MY HOMIE SAY DAT SHIT)
Everybody stay fly get money kill and fuck bitches
I’m hittin anything in plain view for my riches
VA’s finest fillin up ditches, when niggaz turn to bitches
die for zero digits; I’ma giant yall midgets
I know killaz that kill for a fee 
that’ll kill yo’ ass for free, believe me 
How you wanna die fast or slowly?
Fast as a rolie, slow as a rolie polie
I bought yo shit it was weak, trashed it now you owe me
All the hardcore niggas know me
I aint knockin, I’m jus gon’ bust up in the motherfucker
Takin anything that’s rightfully mines
Lust, AKs, rifles, and nines
Physique crew, thick designs
wit jewels that shine all the time
Ain’t nuthin sweet about this rate of mystique
Got niggas while you eat shit sleep and beat yo meat
die reachin fo heat, leave you leakin in da street
Niggas screamin he was a good boy ever since he was born
but fuck it he gon life must go on niggas don’t live that long
but hoes in wigs niggas that think they head strong
got niggas hollerin Jewelz dead wrong on this song
THIS TYPE OF MURDA DONT NEED NO HOOK
JUST FORTY FUCKIN BARS FROM DA MOUF OF A CROOK!!!
YO!!

{Ooh, L-Don}

[Intro: Diddy] (Rick Ross) {Gucci Mane}
(Real niggaz) {Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...}
Ayo, ayo Waka (Boss!) {BURR~!!}

I see you, boy (Let’s turn the temperature up on these niggaz again, nigga)
Y’all must’ve forgot, I started this shit
Yeah, check this out
THIS -- IS -- THE REMIX

[Diddy - Verse 1ne]
I got my billions up, fuckin with dem white folks
Now I don’t give a fuck, ‘cause I’m richer than dem white folks
Lamborghini trucks, y’all ain’t even seen it yet
Bought me Teterboro just to Diddy bop and land my jet (Ahhhhhh-OWWWWW!!!!!)
I’m-I’m hustlin out of Harlem, Paulie Castellano (Don’t stop)
Bitch, I am a problem, I just bought the Delano (That’s right)
Pimpin in my convo, bitches come in combos
Pictures of Christopher on my wall all in my condo
I don’t fuck with fake hoes! All I touch is J-Lo’s 
All I drink is my shit, Ciroc by the case load (Let’s go!)
Movies is my next shit, two mil on my necklace
Bad Boy - 80 million motherfuckin records! 
(BITCH~!!!)

[Rick Ross - Verse 2wo]
I fucked my money up... I bought another Rolls Royce
to pick my homies up... my top back like "Oh boy"
Step yo’ game up... You ridin nigga, hold on
I switched the game up.. One stack that’s for the whole zone
That’s thirty-six a kilo, BITCH, I think I’m Nino
BITCH, I think I’m Scarface, BITCH, I’m Al Pacino
Flippin my lil’ C-notes, painted my new Benzo
Took my bitch to Red Lobster, I cain’t feed no friends, hoe!
Bitch, I’m on my high horse, jewels I rock I die for
‘cause that shit that I bought, shoot yo’ ass that’s my fault
Bitch, I’m on this asphalt, money makin be the thing
Bitch, I’m on my last straw, them choppers always do the thing

[Chorus 2X]
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH~! 
O let’s doooooo it
Hey - o let’s doooooo it 
Hey - o let’s doooooo it
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH~!
Drug dealin music
Hey - I influence
Hey - I influence

[Waka Flocka Flame - Verse 3hree]
I FUCKED my money up -- (Damn!) 
Now I can’t re-up
Ran up in his spot (spot) 
Just to get my stacks up
Now I’m back on deck (deck)
So shawty, what the FUCK you want?!
Heard he talkin shit (shit) 
But this ain’t what the FUCK he want! (Flocka!)
Lock my CEO up, now it’s back to coka
Niggaz talkin shit brah, hang ‘em by the rope-a
Hit ‘em wit the choppa, call dat shit hot llama
Call me waka Flocka, a/k/a Young wild Nigga
A/k/a Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night, wit the hard and soft
Stacks on the flo’, watch {?} boy whip it
Shook it to the left then he shook it to the right
So Icey, Brick Boys, got it all night
These lame ass niggaz ain’t got no fight
Kick in my door we gon’ shoot out all night {*echoes*}

[Gucci Mane - Verse 4our]
(Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...WAH)
BURR~!! BURR~!! GUCCI!
I stack my money up, Brick Squad we so g’d up
I’m countin cash in my office, sippin coffee with my feet up (Wooooow)
Haters sendin threats, like they want beef but dey know dey don’t
Meet Flocka at the dealership, I told him get what the FUCK you want (Well damn!)
They locked my homeboy Verne up, 1999 for murder
Now niggaz claiming Zone 6, that I ain’t never heard of
Hit you with the carbon, but why when I got shooters?
You heard Gucci was locked up, but that was just a rumor! (GUCCI!)
Got purp, got pills, got lean, plus I got powder for you snorters {*snorts*}
You wanna find me, I-20 to {EAST ATLANTA, GEORGIA}
I send my female shooters {*mwah*}, that rock-a-bye baaay-baaay 
1017 shawty, in my hood we got them AKs’

[Chorus]

[ INTRO ]
We was born in the streets of L.A.
Where the streets ain’t safe at night
Between the beeper and the color of a rag
We have chosen the mic, right?
So the philosophy we learned on the streets
We now bring to this muthafuckin stage
And at this time we likes to unload
These lyrics like a 12-guage

[ VERSE 1: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Bail on stage with a gangster lean
Busters duck once I’m on the scene
Opponents went out the do’
The innocents hit the flo’
As if we started a war
Boo-Yaa! It means a cry from a shotgun
You want some of this, come on and get some
Feel that Boo-Yaa bass, it get louder
Only O.M.B. could provide that power
Power, from the brothers in black (ha!)
No radio can stop this track (ha!)
The Ridd, yeah, gettin rid of MC’s
I get them before they even try to get me
If the enemy tries to mob
Get mopped by the Boo-Yaa hit squad
Inmates from the mad house, comin from the lock-in
Chilled with the rats ??????
You try to run, but you don’t get far
Cause I spray your ass with the letter R

Gangsta Ridd - is what?

Comin from the mind of a criminal-ex
Out on a furlough just to snap necks
Once again -
Once, once, once again
Once again the rap criminal, known to be a loc
Since it’s rated R (this is for the old folks)
Restricted for the ears of a minor
Lyrics like the sun, so strong it might blind ya
This jam was created for the ears of a realist
Get off my shit list (?????)
Murder He Wrote, that was my last jam
Like Michael Jordan with the new dunk (check out the new slam)
Here it is and you’re beggin for more
A new slam, from the criminal lord
This jam is resctricted for the MCs that fear me
Everytime it play, they run when they hear me
Keep runnin, but you don’t get far

But the louder it gets we get much respect

That’s my job, puttin em on what
You don’t wanna move, ??????
Smoke from my microphone still linger
MC’s drop a dime to the one-time ?????
Sayin I did it, yeah, the Ridd did it
Now that I know you a snitch, I ain’t with it
Buster Brown, you just a clown from a new town
Huffin like you’re bad - you ain’t down
Hold it, stop, wait a minute and don’t move
I have a nation rockin to this groove

Restricted for the ears of the mental insane
Lyrics like a drug, you’re blowin your brain
Like the homie named Deathrow, Deathrow my bro
Had to go, he was next in row
He went solo, sold his soul to the devil
This I know, he had a tatoo on his elbow
Turn up the radio, this is what he showed
It read: ‘life’s goin too slow’
Hesitate, you’re too late (yeah) the doubt in your route
Is that’s what life really about?
This I know, Deathrow was a criminal
It was his time to go, life was too slow
Restricted for the ears of a minor
Make sure there’s a adult behind ya

I can’t sleep

Well it hard to get to bed with a head full of dreams

[Yeshua Da PoED]
Yeah, ah, yeah, we just cooling in the lab
Got my man Jedi about to set it off

[Jedi]
Yo 
1, 2, yo

Brothers be sayin’ that I’m out of line
‘Cuz I got a rhyme that run up your spine
And clog up arteries like swine
But, yo, I got a mind that develop rhymes
That run up and down your base
Around your brain, until you know the name
It’s Jedi, the fifth apocalypse
Droppin’ the proper science to kids
And break ‘em down with gifted, different arithmetic that I created
In the lab where beats are marinated
And when released in the streets the heads’ll be animated
‘Til the get decapitated
For rhymes are now ?rated? should now be laminated
And put up on walls
Along with every platinum plaque
You see, technology created CDs 
‘Cuz I know if you melt the wax you felt the facts
Of life, and fuckin’ wit’ Jedi or might seep in your afterlife
A sacrifice, battle to take away your bragging rights
Travel throughout the sites
To explore more than the lights Jedi brings up
More than the force of life, more like a paradise, and poltergeist
Plus I got an appetite for destruction that ignites
And when I’m the mic, my flow is similar to
A demon, ‘cuz it goes for your main artery
Until your soul is a part of me and your left barely breathin’
You see, no one plans to help you, son, no one plans to stop me
And the only manual attention your gettin’ is an autopsy

Chorus:
(Scratched) "My lips is like a ??? as I start to spray it." Q-Tip

[Yeshua]
Uh, yo, yo
Brothers be given me a lot of dap, ‘cuz I gotta rap
To splittin’ your caps, and puttin’ Brooklyn on the map
But yo, just on the track, I don’t know how to act
Makin’ cats collapse like heart attacks, in fact
It’s Yeshua Da PoED, one of the last in my class of emcees to be true
Evidently, there be too many cats to represent me that I can see through
Too many overrated emcees just blockin’ my view
I’d really rather peep the pretty bitches they get to show their ass in
the video
Sometimes I need to find some piece of mind, release the rhyme
To be combined, no better way to get away from the times
But to forget the everyday and let it spray ‘til I shine
I said forget the everyday and let it spray ‘til I shine
‘Cuz, yo, these cats don’t really know a fuckin’ thing about rhymes
And, yo, I really couldn’t care, yo, what they think about mine
Like dat

Chorus

[Jedi] 
For an update
We upsettin’ and detonatin’ bombs
Takin’ leg and arms and ????
For makin’ stars...

[Yeshua] 
...Out of fakes
To salivate while I spit
Create a rhythm to battle flakes
That only know how to make...

[Jedi] 
...Tracks that’s out of date
In fact, I counter, counter-attack to have you collapse

[Both]
Flat on your back
We gather...

[Yeshua]
...Adequate raps for the purpose of excursion
My version of a certain Persian rug is bugged...

[Both]
...Like drugs...

[Jedi]
...That serves because we nervous of our actions
If we decide to, make this a repertoire, I
Assembly lyrics that bring it to any rap seminar

[Yeshua]
Many are
Light up the park ‘cuz what we on is beyond the stars
It’s so bizarre, got flows that scar bitches that paw

[Jedi]
Lay in the back of a car
Sayin’ to tap ‘em until they see Mars
And if still don’t know who we are
It’s Jedi, the Son of Spock, and my nigga Yeshua (echoed)

Chorus

[Jedi]
Yeah, what?
Jedi, Son of Spock, Yeshua, DJ Bless

[Yeshua]
Bless

[Jedi]
Wee Bee Foolish house of reps

[Yeshua]
And we out

First off
Imma give you my own
Rendition of alien flow
Hotter than lithium crystals that glow
Like billions of shimmering
One’s and O’s
Niggas be killing me \xc2\x85.fuck a throne
I rest my up on Nibiru
Channeling lizards from planets
Beyond
This world and niggas like you

How could you think I’m any lesser than God
I’m in the stars
Doing one arm pull ups
my whole palm wrapped around mars
A rap phenomenon got Amen Ra
Trapped in my bars
Burn through your circuitry
Bursting your Dre beats on ya moms
Geddy lean em
Heavy bag work in the morn
High intensity intervals
training my verses like arms
But on the real
All these rap niggas know the deal
New niggas just new niggas
But yall niggas are meals
And I got more than two children
Whos nutrition and bills
Got me coming for you niggas with crucifixes and nails
Geddy lean on em
Yea the Geddy movement is real
Secreting poison from my tongue
Produce the truth when it spills
Im black fire and red ice
Yea dude got skills
I’m just frightenly so nice
I’m in the Booth getting chills
You getting bye I’m getting tight
Doing ny push up and dips

New york died with a broken heart
Cuz ain’t no love
But don’t cry nigga pull ya gun
Shoot up a club
Yea I’m nice
and im starting my buzz
Pardon my thug
Holla at me Cuz
I’m Everywhere like cops and bloods
How could you even be mad hes claiming king of new York?
He just gave you niggas life with one thought
Like, Eat peasants
Revive your street presence
Grab a chair get a fork
Dom Deluise conning the streets
Like he’s baring the cross?
Pleeaaase
Fuck you and all them niggas you run with
Y’all all just flakes of dead skin
Off of puns dick
Ya all fake
A bunch if grown men on some son shit
With no cake on that straight fight over crumbs shit
And fuck whoever acting too hard to respond
Like I’m a street nigga
You probably just dont got bars
And them other wack responses your shit was garbage
From Lupes boggling gargle
To B.O.B.’s corny guitar
And anybody after
Who think they really want it with God
Better come hard porno actors
Smashing backs into cars
Nigga what?
I put in work then lay in cut
And just wait..
But most these rap niggas is butt!
So fuck it

[Chorus]
In every song I sing
I just got to hail my King
HE is the truth, that lies within
In every song I sing
I just got to hail my King
HE is the truth that lies within

[Verse 1]
The birds and the bees they cling
Together sweet honey they bring
Jah notice everyting from winter to spring
He made the raindrops fall
He quench earth’s thirst for all
How could I deny Jah Rastafari

When them system fail
HE keeps an eye on them
There’s no question why
I hail Rastafari

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Around Rastafari Throne
Thats where I wanna build my home
Where there’s always love
And nothing to prove
Whether you are tall
Or whether you are small
Jah say equal rights and justice for us all
When them system fail
Jah keep an eye on them
There’s no question why
I hail Rastafari

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jah stay around Rastafari Throne
That’s where i wanna build my home
Where there’s always love
And nothing to prove
Cause whether you are tall
Cause whether you are small
Jah say equal rights and justice for us all
Cause when them system fail
Jah keep an eye on them
Cause how could I deny Jah Rastafari

[Chorus: fades]

[Intro]
[Dirty Red] Yeah, this is how we do it y’all
[DJ Yella]  check it out, tell them where we from
[Dirty Red] Westside, yeah, that’s right
[DJ Yella]  Dirty Red is in the house, drop it for them

[Verse 1: Dirty Red]
It all started on a hot summer day
Creepin’ through L.A. - in a 6 Tray Choverlet
Impala, turned it up, Crenshew
We hit the streets so I put the chrome grip on my lap y’all
That’s how we do it on the West Side
Ain’t nothin’ nice when the nigga wanna who-ride
So I glide, the further I go, the thicker the hoe
The shit was on the deck for the gigolo
I moved slow to the liquor bang Parking Lot
My nigga Yella got a taste for some pimpin’ knots 
Since Little Burners, we’re quick learners
So fuck stress, on a night like this
You got to give it your best

[Chorus: Michel’le]
We’re on the West Side
Swear on the West Side
Started
Yeah, ooooohhhh

[Verse 2: Dirty Red]
Fresh out the sack, I’m feelin’ kind of right
I’m pullin’ down my Rag Top, high as a kite
Boom shinnin’ of the streets’ light
When my 17th Crowl sounds bump the concrete
This is how the Gs ball
Got the glock 10, sittin’ smooth in the cut
Just incase some shit jumped, I ain’t goin’ out like no punk
In my trunk sittin’ petty, a Chrome Desert Eagle
Ain’t trippin’ of no One Time cause all my shit is legal
I pulls to the right, some niggaz lookin’ shady
Thinkin’ cause I’m solo, that maybe they can fade me
A little bit crazy but I’m keepin’ my composure
Think up on my head bein’ puffin’ on my Dojah
Cause we’re on the West Side

[Chorus: Michel’le]
We’re on the West Side
Swear on the West Side
Started

[Verse 3: Dirty Red]
I glanced to my right, these niggaz damn ain’t trippin’
I put my shit on safety and continue with my dippin’
You’ll see me when you spittin, like this clip to my left
I blow my smoke, clear my throat, put Indo in my chest
Peep my game, haters think, come on us to take a ride
Dippin’ into a spot over on the West Side
You can get the drink, but bring your whole dank
Cause bitches nowadays, be all about that gank
I bust me a bitch, and pulls to the store
Cause a got a crave for a cold 40 O
And a philly, yeah, so I can get a little tipsy
See my nigga E in a Cold Eight fifty
We’re on the West Side

[Chorus: Michel’le w/ Minor Variations]
We’re on the West Side
West Side, stalkin’
Swear on the West Side
We’re on the West Side ooooohhhh yeah

[Verse 1: C-Bo]
Top down, side ways through the town
Suckas want fo’ cuz I hit they block for a second round
Lets who ride and buck these suckas down quick
Pop in the clips and skips down these fool’s strip
Straight to they sto’, breakin they ass off something proper
The gun G-O-D’s pulled up, sitting on choppers
Cuz you know I can’t be slippin in the ‘94
So put up a glock, cuz we be buckin with them 4.4’s
45. Auto Mag. .30 round clip. Fully Mag
P-30, mini-14. Desert Eagle, 55 Braggets
I guess I’m tired of getting crept on, stepped on
We load the high explosives talons when the ?sweats on?
So put up your duke as I get deeper you shoot for the one in the deuce
Drop the top of the block, poppin the glide, I pursue
It’s just another g fillin yo bad ass up to the rim
Pop the clip with a mack-10
Hop out the truck and drop that grin
Cuz like A, I’m in it to win it and plus ? paper G
So make way, ?? Mack at ya front teeth
Cuz when you playing with mines, you playin with yo life
So don’t be starting
You wake with fullies strapped at your bed side
Chiddy-chiddy bang bang, nothing but that Garden game
Who ride, and ? old records. Get your face re-arranged
Cuz on my block, 24-7 fools be poppin they glocks
In the strip, poppin they clip
Puttin in work, letting it rip
As they keep fallin
the day we spend it cuz g’s be keep ballin
No time for stallin
A .30 round clip and the shots I’m callin.
Cuz in this game, when you livin it strange aim for the brain
It’s all for one and one for all cuz in the game only one gangst’
Proceed with caution
uz like hoe suckas, I be tossin
Dead bodies are bridges
One to the head, then broke out in ditches
Before you step to the psycopath lunatic
H ave yo gat in yo hand and ready for the 187 dance!

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I woke in the morning with a .9 to my head
thinking that I’m dead
Surprised to see the TAS and the damn feds
I knew it was over
Bo Loc done got struck in the game
Po-po’s got me face down on the bed by a big bag of ‘caine
And I’m thinkin in my head ‘I just left Y.A.’
Now on my way to the penitentiary for a yola case
Damn I’m struck like the ? that’s all I can say
Cuz I be countin down from 20 years, every 365 days
In the game when you stuck, you stuck up the river with bad luck
Where suckas be getting that ass tucked
It’s off the ? and off the buck
And I believe in eight millions of ways to die
Cuz if you Black and believe in gettin licked
Then you believe in getting fried
Snatched from floor by officer Town’s and one of his punk boys?
Got crack in my pockets, 1700, the canines got me ‘noid
But I play dumb. Bo Loc got that decomposure
Last night, settled for ten, hold up for 20 game, still got me doja
And I’m thinkin ‘this just a dank game nightmare’
Shotguns and glocks and I can see the siren lights
Then out the do’ on my - face
Hands cuffed tightly behind my back and they still doin me like a slave
Cant fight back cuz I’m shackled
from my wrist to my ankles and now these pigs wanna wrestle
They drug me down to the county
Took three Gs out my pocket and beat me down to the ground
G, the stuff got hectic
Getting triple-teamed by three punk white detectives.
Im coughing up blood, holdin on my ribs
For every hit I’m thinkin bout killin all they kids
One kicked and missed, slipped in my blood
I made a G-move
So ??? Went for his holster, itchin to get my blast on
I’d rather be dead than tanked up, gettin stomped on
187 dance on these punk suckas
Try to take ya boy out the game like a busta
Now they know what it’s like gettin with a psycho
With the Garden Blocks it’s all about survival (echoed)

I wanna have a MeatShake
I wanna have a MeatShake
I wanna know the secret
I wanna know the secret
I gotta have a MeatShake
Gotta have a MeatShake
I gotta know the secret
I gotta know the secret
I w..

[ couple in car ]
You know hon, I’m, I’m kinda hungry a little bit
Ehm, one of these MeatShakes kinda sounds kinda good
Yeah, it sounds... trippy
Yeah, let’s uh, let’s check it out, check it out
Look, there’s one over there
Oh yeah yeah yeah, I’ll pull over
I got the money
Alright, let’s go to the drive through
Yeah, definitely, definitely
I could use a shake

(Hello and welcome to MeatShake)
Hi
Hi, how are you there?
(I am doing meaty good)
Yeah..
(Well, may I take your order) Yeah, my wife would like a shake
(Okay, what flavor do you want? We have chicken, pork or steak)
Huh? (We also have our special of the month Turkey Jerky
So which one will it be?) Mh - I think that you misheard me
(Hello?) Maybe I spoke too soft or you just didn’t listen
(You said you want a shake) Yeah, but then you mentioned chicken?
(Uh-huh, or steak or pork or Turkey Jerky) Right, I’m confused
(Oh, I see you’re not familiar with ingredients we use
First we take a measure of the sweetest dairy creams
Combine it with your meat of choice, along with cheese and beans
We mix it in a juicy batter, then we heat it up
And add the secret syrup, then serve it in a cup)
Yuck! That sounds disgusting (I see you’re not excited)
But wait until you tried it, you’ll want it in your diet)
Ah-ah (It’s a warm and tasty way to eat your daily beef
And it’s very, very smooth, you don’t have to use your teeth
It’s kinda like the brooth a pregnant women gives her fetus
It builds you up and makes you strong) People really eat this?
(We’ve served a half a million and they’ve all been satisfied
We’re expanding new locations and they’re growing nationwide)
But back to the shake (Okay) All you have are meats?
(Ah-ha) What about chocolate, strawberry or peach?
(Well, we do have vanilla) Now that sounds delicious
(But it’s Vanilla Ham, we only make it during Christmas
Maybe you’d be happier to go across the street
You could eat at Veggie Hut where they don’t use any meat
They play world music so it’s perfect for a hippie
You can talk about communism, meat-hating sissy)
What?
(Beat it granolas)
We’re not granolas
(Don’t you have a protest to get to or something?)
That’s so lame, this place sucks
So rude, honey, he just called me a sissy to my face
I’m not a sissy
(Shouldn’t you be reading _Dianetics_?)
We’re outta here

Imagine if I showed you one day I was leaving the hood
Would you call me a sellout?  Would you say it’s all good?
Would you follow if you could?
Or would you just tell me get the hell out?
And imagine if I showed you that I found another way
of getting dough without doing dirt-- let’s blurt
Would you love me for giving me some hope
Or resent me cos your pride got hurt?
Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate
And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth
Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South
Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack
And thank god that we didn’t have to live like that
Just the image on the TV as we’re comfortably sat
Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine
Not a worry in the world as we casually chat
Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside
No experience, not a clue about a rough ride
No harassment, no boy dem (?) on our backside
That would be *amazing*, still
I know you wonder would make you any less real?
What’s the corresponding standing in (?), offering
If you had a better offer would you go for the kill?
Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel?
Does it all seem worthwhile for ya?
Try and put it in perspective
Retrospective of your profile and your honor
Do you wanna hang about, or are you a goner?
Come along, think fast, decision time
You’ve been living in the grime, don’t you wanna climb?
The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment
Or are you looking for the hype and excitement?
Cos with so much drama in the LDN
It’s kind of hard to find legal money to spend
Generation genocide looks possible
The rate at which we draw for this game and pretend
But we don’t know who the real enemy is
Who should be held responsible, instead we defend
A couple square meters of pavement, in the end
What will be achieved my friends?

(Numskull)
It’s a Friday night, and I ain’t got no ass
No car, no brew, no get high stash
I done watched every movie in the house
And my Blockbuster bill is like eighty bucks, so that plan’s out
I done went through the phone book from front to back
From new hoes to three year ago old school rats
And I’m banned from all the clubs cuz I don’t tip the door niggas
Look like, you eatin’ three-hundred pound, six four niggas
Plus, I don’t wear suits to boogie in
I wear dope dealer shits that I can get some pussy in
My niggas is down to ride, but I’m tired of seein’ them
Swear I need me a muthafuckin’ real girlfriend
But that’s out of the question, cuz I treat ‘em like shit
Take they cash, take they car, make ‘em fuck the whole clique
Damn!  I realized I’m just burnin’ my bridges
And my dick feelin’ good rubbin’ up against my britches

[Chorus 2X: Clee]
Have you ever had a day you had nothin’ you need?
No ass, no cash, no drank, and no weed?
And all the hoes you could’ve fucked you told to back off?
It’s lookin’ like to me it’s time to jack off

(Numskull)
Now that I done let one go, I’m thinkin’ "Say now"
I can cope with my life bein’ dull, boring, and plain now
But lately, I find myself beatin’ more often
If every nut was year off my life, for me it’s coffins
If it’s true what they say, I’m goin’ blind right now
My palms is growin’ hair, I’m thinkin’ porn right now
If it was a whole band here, I’d be a horn right now
If it’s a party over there, I’d be scorin’ right now

(Clee)
See I’m alone in my room, and I’m about to jack off
Imaginin’ a bad bitch givin’ me some good balls
See at the present time, I ain’t got no ass
Wanna get high first, but I got no weed, no hash
Strolled to the ATM and said "I’m out of cash!"
Then on the way home, I ran out of gas
Now I gotta walk 12 blocks, plus it’s hot
And to make it even worse, a nigga dick on rock

[Chorus]

(Clee)
Finally get back to the house in a broken sweat
Turn on the TV, everything provokin’ sex
I can’t believe today, can’t believe my luck
Can’t believe I can’t find one hoe to fuck!
Can’t believe I left the house and got stuck
Can’t believe I can’t afford a tow truck
And you know what?  Waitin’ for a bitch I’m goin’ loco
Don’t even know if one comin’, I only got a hopeful
Time to go ahead and put my first plan in motion
Go and get my tie, go and get my lotion
Turn on the porn tape, then I get to strokin’
Wish I was the cat, that this bitch was deep throatin’

[sound of a lotion dispenser, and groaning]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 4X]
I tell ‘em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

If I was y’all I wouldn’t come around here
I’d watch both pots cause they ain’t from around here
Man stay with the stizzy cause I’m from around here
And not even the cops dare to come around here

So if ya hit the ambulance it don’t come around here
Now ya stuck not even cabs they don’t run around here
If ya hungry pizzaman he don’t come around here
And I bet Jehovas Witness they knock around here
Whips get stolen they never gettin towed around here
Stay in the news, but never nuthin’ new around here

If you ain’t never been to the ghetto man
Don’t ever come to the ghetto man

[Chorus 4X]

I heard there was a few people down there
Welfare made the rent a lil cheaper down there
Don’t be slippin you’ll get cut up and cheated with down here
For ya bling, even ya two way beeper down there
I got this bitch, mmm... she got a crib down there
I moved out while still get to live down there
You couldn’t go down there to see ho around there
I you ever ask around there, I’ll go down there
So don’t go down there, in ya gold down there
Ya lookin for trouble even when ya stroll down there
‘N ya whipped, popped at down the road down there
They don’t play
Streets of war... hopes down there
Who ain’t, hood prince still poor down there
been workin mighty hard ‘til they old down there
‘N they got a security guard in the store down there
But them kids are sellin me stuff they stole down there..man

[Chorus 4X]

Well I guess its the same everywhere
Come around iced-out n you get ‘aight’ anywhere
Fight to give it up or you get ‘aight’ anywhere
Most these people...they don’t live anywhere
So every other night they just sleep everywhere
I tried to live that life but it ain’t get me anywhere
I make my money here there but I can make it anywhere
Ask me bout me ‘Suni’, they respect me everywhere
Been in biggin’ pop-down here there everywhere
Every block locked down here there everywhere
Guess they got fiends every block everywhere
‘N they pumpin’ Biggie ‘n ‘Pac every block everywhere
When ya lookin for the cops...u can’t find ‘em anywhere
Kids lookin for the pops ‘n can’t find ‘em anywhere
‘N their mama keep on switchin the creep down there

[Chorus 4X]

Is that your place?
Is that your hood?
Is that your block?

Is that your place?
Is that your hood?
Is that your block?
Is that your hood?

Yo....

I’ll be there soon to a hood near you

(Intro) Priest
For all prisoners breaking out of the mental prison
We gon’ make it a Big Deal
First one’s Unique Divine, Killah Priest
Big Deal on the wills of steel
Holding it, popping that steel
N God We Trust, y’all afraid of us

[Unique Divine]
My pen leaks whenever my thoughts speak
I operate and I create and none of them mentioned
To sweat heat, my mind’s stable and organized, swerve two times
‘Fore I reach on different plateaus in a form of a nine
I got a street mentality; your people can’t handle me
Poetically, my shit is deep like the Galaxy
I drop like Uranium, mass hysteria
Burn down your brain’s nerves, fiends will check for plush
I energize lyrical shocks to overwhelm a Power Plant
More than a million volts on mics that’ve I inclined
My conscious is too evolved like Einstein
So my theories will damage your mind
My soul travels whenever I sleep to find knowledge
And brings back visions I mentioned, I got all accomplished
Faith, at least we threw the dust
See life is a dirty bitch, but still N God We Trust

(Hook) Big Deal
N God We Trust
N God We Trust
N God We Trust
N God We Trust

[Big Deal]
Let’s bring the real to a stand still
Cats who gassed to keep a damn mill
In these killer fields, everyday a drug deal
Junkies rob and steal
Criminals that’s over the hill
Kill a nigga for a dollar bill
Fuck your girl off an X-pill
‘Cause that’s how I feel
Let’s take a trip to my projects
Welfare checks to get hood love, you just bust your Tek
Go to jail then you gain your respect
Talk shit, then a mothafucka will come up and cut your neck
Everyday I see niggas wild out on dust
Stand on the corner selling shit for calls they’ve lust
Don’t talk too much, just guns they bust
And it won’t stop until they fucking rust
Reach for the sky and tell who is us?
Mothafucka, N God We Trust

[Killah Priest]
Body, a/k/a Priesthood
Yeah, uh-huh, N God We Trust
Killah Priest and Body
Uh-huh, ok, check it out

Yo, I start spazzing and stick my claws in back of a Dragon
The sky is black and I imagine that I’m clapping at Phantoms
The ghetto’s haunting; see the Beast and Devil’s on corners
I wake up in torture, screaming in horror
See the FEMA, the Demon’s are on us
I plea with the lawyers, judges and the Beast
Three in the morning, I’m hugging the streets
The streets embrace me back with arms full of cracks
Bullets for gats and hooded rats
Niggas are dodging and ducking, robbing and busting
It’s disgusting; I’m in the mirror having discussions
Niggas on the pavement having concussions
It’s all corruptions, the Devil’s seduction
The ghetto is sucked in, its stomach with no win
We’re all punished and accused by the public
It’s like N God We Trust it, niggas squeeze and bust quick
It’s all about the trees and the guts
Cops make us freeze ‘til the shot free us up
N God We Trust, N God We Trust, N God We Trust

(Hook) Big Deal
N God We Trust
N God We Trust

Uh, uh, yeah
Baby I’m your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I’m you’re hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving me so faithful, your love has kept me warm
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around
I’m an angel of love, I’m an angel of love, for you

I’ll be your hot comfy, to keep you warm and nice
You’ll be my beautiful baby, no need to fuss and fight
Friends try to separate us, you’ll be here by my side
My love for you, I can’t hide no no
Your will inside to survive
Baby I’m your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I’m you’re hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving me so faithful, your love has kept me warm
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around

In my life you’ve been a blessing, like treasures to behold
Love is such a mystery, the future, now unfolds
In your eyes I see the sign, two hearts are intertwined
You’ve found the best love you could find
A love like yours and mine, yeah
You found out there’s love you can find
Baby I’m your angel, when you make sweet love to me
Your knight in shining armor, loving you tenderly

Baby I’m you’re hero, I save you from bad storms
Loving you so faithful, your love has kept me more
Never let them hurt, you, they have no right to keep you down
Keep your head up to the sky girl, cause love has come around
I’m an angel of love, I’m an angel of love, for you

[Rubbabandz]
Bandz hold it down like a muthafucka
I got bitches holding guns and they will touch ya
Trust me, I’m a nigga with a hood degree
Stapleton Projects, straight N.Y.C.
I’m certified, you don’t want no problem with me
I got heat, burn niggas to the tenth degree
This my hood, get caught slipping out here
You can get your top popped off round here
Can’t stand homo crib
Fake ass pimp nigga wit a perm in his hair
Low blow, that’s right I don’t fight fair
And I don’t pull out guns and shoot up in the air
I toke headshots to make ya body rock
You get touched then call the cops
Fake ass thug nigga, taking the stand
Acting like we tight, we ain’t really mans
Brought some Brooklyn niggas to my mom’s house, trynna get me murked out
And you supposed to be my right hand?
The type of nigga won’t do shit to his enemy
A killa’s best friend, and he supposed to be kinning me
You got to be kidding me, nigga you a bitch
A fake blood nigga, turned crip, turned snitch
Bring that shit, I don’t care who you get
Put a price on my head, and I still won’t get hit

Have you ever wondered why the birds don’t sing
Have you ever wondered why your soul don’t ring
Have you ever wondered why your ears can’t hear
exactly what’s goin’ on from front to rear
Have you ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors
and Have you ever wanted to just lay on the floor
and sit back and just let the world pass and you just wanted to just crash
Have you ever on the real just wanted to be a thug
Have you ever heard some shit that just made you bug
Have you ever wanted to do drugs
and just sit back and just lay down on the roof
Have you ever wanted to just sit back and chill
Have you ever wanted to know how everybody feels
Have you ever wanted to lay on a field
and look up at the stars forever and build
Have you ever wondered why Steve’s so sexy
Ever wonder why it’s possible Sean beat Alexy
Have you ever wanted to just sit in a taxi
and laugh ‘cause everybody else is just passin’
Have you ever wondered why popper stoppers don’t work
Have you ever wondered why we gotta stop in a jerk
Have you ever wondered why my dick is so small
and Have you ever wondered why we exist in St. Paul
Have you ever wondered why we gotta sound stupid
Have you ever been shot in the heart by cupid
I’ll tell you one thing; I haven’t and that’s a problem
but as long as I can do this, yo I can’t fathom
Have you ever wondered why the drums sound phat
Have you ever wondered why they went away black
and Have you ever wondered why I gotta stand here and feel claustrophobic
you should know shit
Have you ever wondered why we gotta get illah
Have you ever wondered why we gotta keep it realah
Have you ever wondered why we’re not about the scrillah
Have you ever wanted to do this mass appealah
and Have you ever wanted to rap king of the show
and Have you ever wanted to try getting cornrows
and Have you ever wanted to try getting up a kind of acid drug
just to get beat down by a thug
who wouldnt let you shine or buy his shit except marijuana
because he thought if you wouldn’t do it you’d be a goner
and Have you ever had ill concerns for people
who wouldn’t let you burn or rather see your soul burn
Have you ever had a problem with people who tried to kill you
and that shit is real dude
and Have you ever seen a video and said damn
I wish that was my life instead of some guy’s, right
and Have you ever wondered why Jay-Z sucks
and Have you ever wondered why Lil Kim’s a slut
Have you ever wondered why Foxy Brown’s ugly
and never get up on my dick that don’t bug me
and Have you ever wondered why we bullshit
Ever wonder why we gotta pull shit
Have you ever wondered why preachers hide behind their pulpit
and preach forever, it’s not clever...

I would like to welcome to the stage right now

Come on, come on, come on, come on)

(AZ)
A nigga seen it, triple beam shit, brown and green mix
Fiend this, made for machines that kick
Blow ya speakers out, only the real I speak about
Made to freak you out, fuck with ya mom but teach you routes
Nigga spots rollin, shoot-out, gun shots blowin
Older niggas got shorties on the block holdin
Lost, my youngest cousin sittin up north
Takin a short from another nigga hittin ‘em off
Two to four, guess it’s no tellin what some’ll do to score
Four pounds give off sounds through the door
We waited, but now it’s time to designate it
You hate it, had the drop but hesitated

(Hook - Allure & Case)
Life goes on, life like two’s and five
Who decides what’s wrong or right
Just got paid feelin good tonight
Life goes on
In my world, life like two’s and five
Who decides what’s wrong or right
Just got paid feelin good tonight
Life goes on and on

(Common)
Yo A-Zilla, you know I ain’t the type to play killa
But this day still arrives in my mind like a light
A damn Thursday night, and plans to be out
‘Til the night served daylight, but it ain’t happen
Rappin to myself ‘cause it wasn’t no one to rap to
This villian came to me like ‘somebody lookin at you’
‘Cause I’m Common Sense and I rap consciousness
He was prompt to diss, mad ‘cause my guy used to knock his bitch
I could sense he was tryna’ bring it, but I wasn’t ready to recieve it
Fact I make him leave it
Before he popped some shit I did the opposite and stole ‘em
Back his lady tried to hold him, like Big Pun I scold ‘em and told ‘em
I ain’t a shooter I just punch a lot
Between blows this big tried to up his glock
His brother watched swoop like big daddy on teenage love
He got ??? to my tape by C nigga Dub
Got his dome in a hug, muffed his broad back with one hand
Tried to pop, it must’ve been a ??? ‘cause the gun jammed
Unplanned I disarmed this trick, nigga
Pistol-whipped his ass, his ladies, I was palmin it
Hollered ‘87 reign dominate’
Needed a fight that night, me and my woman had an argument

(Hook - Allure & Case)

(Case)
People come and people go, there’s one thing that you must know
Life goes on yeah
No matter what you’re going through, I’m just trying to tell you
Life goes on and on
Everybody’s got their own thing, some just don’t know how to handle it
I need to tell ya, you need to know
‘Cause I know, life goes on, life goes on

(Hook - Allure & Case)

Feelin good, feelin good
In my world, in my world
Feelin good
Where you gonna go
Feelin good

Hop in my whip and ride, we can slip’n’slide
What’s the deal shorty?, let’s get it right
You ain’t the silly type, and that I kinda like
Take you through the Prada life like I got wife
Now we can do the fool, long as the mood is cool
Take you to the pool, and have a drink or two
You play a major role, this how the game’ll go
Work for the paper hoe, and get a player dough
See I’m a business man, no stocks and bonds
Tippin’ on the block, man I’m livin large
I’m in the Hummer truck, call your girls up
I got the fellas wit’ me, so let ‘em know wassup
Cause we gon’ get it crunk, watch how this kid’ll stunt
Tear this city up, you ain’t gon’ get enough
Now I’m gone do you right, I ain’t the foolish type
I ain’t the goofy type, so we can cruise the night

[Hook - Jason Weaver] (White Boy)
Girl, whatever you wanna do tonight, then it’s alright
If you wanna roll with this thug tonight then it’s alright (You know it’s alright shorty)

Go the shady route, but I’ma bang it out
I’m not a crazy man, I’m a 80’s man
Slight thin, light skinned, young ladies man
Sippin’ Courvasier, pimpin’ don’t stop today
You got a man but you itchin’ just to hop away
I see you workin’ wit’ it, and you learn to get it
Be wit’ ya man, I just want you for them thirty minutes
Sex what I can do, that’s what I plan to
Stop playin’ boo, actin’ all brand new
You need to kick it wit’ me, or keep a distance from me
It’s more fish in the sea, I got a pimpin’ degree
I’ll pick you up, and we can twist some blunts
I see your instand trust but you just hit me up

[Hook]

[White Boy]
Now that you in the mood, let’s take a city cruise
Escape the city blues on a secret Rendevouz
Sip a lil’ Mo’, twist a lil’ dro
Lay back in the ‘lac bumpin’ Lil Mo
How you do it boo?, you so beautiful
Pretty eyes, thick thighs, nice and suitable
There’s nothin’ new to you, you used to compliments
All kinds of gifts, and you my ‘bout it bitch
So how ‘bout it miss, it ain’t no doubt in this
In and out on the couch make you holler Cris
Let’s do it right now, girl get them White Owls
And get them Lifestyles, you ‘bout to lay it down
Take ya clothes off ma’ take a load off
Your body so soft, love the way you show it off
We can party alone, it’s ‘bout six in the mornin’ ya momma ain’t home

[Hook]

Tis the season for certain types
of inner-city dwellers and suburbanites
to observe the nights of the birth of Christ
work the lights and buy merchandise
and when the Bourbon strikes and the fire is blazin’
those of us of the Christmas persuasion
eat gingerbread like Hansel and Gretel
and settle as we revel in some Christmas specials
Ladies tolerate me - I’m wearing O’Shea
I’m looking taller lately, I’m Keyser S\xc3\xb6ze
Christmas is the time of year that we watch Christmas shows
so as soon as your family leaves take off your Christmas clothes and

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I’m watchin’ TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

Pee-Wee’s having a party at the Playhouse
but what will Topanga lay out?
Hit the dog track, bet on Santa’s Little Helper
"Ebenezer Screw" - Beavis working at the shelter
Uncle Jesse locked in the toy store attic
Sing-a-long Mr. Hankey’s Christmas classics
Bing Crosby and David Bowie
Holy Holy, act like you now

Commercial break

Santa’s life I’m livin’ it
show me a tree I’m trimmin’
bought a gift and I’m givin’ it
but first I gotta ribbon it
paper I gotta glitter it
little more than a little bit
pretty so when they rippin’ it
they most likel won’t litter it
tag who will deliver it
To/From in a limerick
quick so when I’m spittin’ it
little kids are illiterate
cold, so when I’m still in it
they M&M; and Skittles
quivering just a little bit
like "Damn, Chaz, you killin’ it"
I’m drillin’ in a Christmas special, yall could never hate it
Stop-motion animation, Gonzo narrate it
putting up a tree, now we gotta decorate it
this song is an ornament, you can commemorate it
I’m Mr. Chaz Kangas, I’m Mr. Rap
get a get-right pass at midnight mass
so that holly-jolly ass gets tapped and...

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I’m watchin’ TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

We’re. Here. To
Bring the people all the music and deliver all the presents now
They. See. Through
Repetitive etiquette when it isn’t holly-jolly now
This. Is a necessary change, from the old simple and plain
here to exercise that brain and break the chain and break your candy canes

[CHORUS]

The battle continues
The devil is trying to constantly win you
When you deviate the path
And inegriated pass
So get back (ack ack) at that (act act)
Actually (ag ag) agitates my actions to agony
The dance floors empty
But you notice some woman in a
Red dress pretending
Shes a damsel in distress (less)
Less she be singing
Songs of pseudo sadness
Plat magic mad at minutes
Madness cast they spell fast
They fail past the walls of innocence
Parallel to Hell

There was a time in my life
When I was dead wrong
Misled
Drawn to this bewildering
Perception of heaven
My first kiss
With temptation pierced through the walls
Of innocence
And it hasn’t been the same ever since

Youll web me
Drawn to my curiousness
Eyes are always gazing, don’t think twice precious
The right path is this web
I’d never leave you astray
I’m here to test your manhood
I’m here to test your faith

She was gawking, I was rockin the mic
My conclusion: she was jockin this type
Conceive line, step close
Watch hope float
I coulda woulda shoulda, just might
Gain the dame, escape into the night

Saw the cape, just take flight
Conversations never took place
Nonchalant pleasantry, she bangin with the black lace
Devilish grin, she swollen in sin
I’m forever foldin again
No holdin it in

Oooo, you come with a friend?
We would be perfect together
You and I were meant for one another
A life’s sentence, we spend

Haha, good, hes baited
Hooked
Real him in
How many ways can I break up in this man

Am I thinking wine and roses
Picturing this dynasty imposes
Slip the potion down the hatch
Relax, relapse, and talk

I’m feeling kinda tired
Lets retire and take a walk

[CHORUS]

She could never grasp the way I sink through the floor
Everytime I hear her voice with the choice to ignore
Even though I reach more, she just look at me emotionless
Pleasure and pain, a fine line never close to this

No will power, Ima tell you how it is
I devour, no damsel in distress
I’m a snake ready to complex, wreck regrets
Hex your life, better check your flight
Fight the pain

I compose a loss for a gain
My main addiction is her thirst for attention
But she failed to mention
The bedroom’s the devils kitchen rippin my dominion in half
Perhaps she had the last laugh
but I came to grasp with my?

My sick intention for sticking and losing
They were dancing and moving
Moving and shaking and grooving
She was looming, I was soothing to position
This competition is ageless and such
In the mixed emotion I turned around and guess what?

Vapor, black stare, coldness in the air
Thought you got away in the cave
You only begun your nightmare

If I’m dreaming it was seeming so real
I used to love her but now
I recover another deceased memory

Sending me to another grave in my mind
Taking my life, wasting my time
Laying on the blade of a knife

I’ll cut ya, you liked it despite the agony
I controlled ya to fold ya
Behold my powers seen

Uhh, uhh
Uhh, hey uh hey

Yo, yo, bust it
How I was walkind mindin my own biz, here it is
I see these two kids bouncin, my way
Eyes blood red with venom
And somethin tellin me that I best not offend ‘em
But they don’t even know I got this badge
that I’m about to flash on that ass like two hits of hash
Pass by ‘em, eye ‘em
Peep money on the left got the toast
Niggaz ready to roast so I’m ghost
Then find another victim so I can jig ‘em
Act like I’m po’-po’, be like YO YO and stick ‘em
Trick ‘em out their currents, them dirty greens
And in the process, stoppin all the flow from fiends
It’s all good cause in my hood it’s better, if my baretta
give these po’ folks some cheddar to the letter
A present day - Robin Hood, crime pays in mad ways nigga
It’s all good

Aiyyo, I’ve been checkin these stick-up kids for weeks
Seein how they pull they jobs and go trick with freaks
I seeks a weakness, in their armor, so I can harm a
crimi-nal with top residu-als, I shall be back
with exact means to get him
Tighten up the grip and let these hollow points hit him
Split him, send they whole crew in mad directions
Correction, I think I’ll make this other selection
Their leader, numero un’, the top cheese
FREEZE!  Don’t make me have to load up to squeeze nigga
I don’t mind wettin up yo’ type try me you dirty slimy
sleazy greasy grimey - where the safe at?
That’s when he show and prove that he a liar
Find and clean the stash and set his fuckin crib on fire
I’m yo’ sire, hittin these crooks to fix my hood
Crime pays in mad ways, nigga it’s all good

[Chorus]

"It’s my turn.." -> Frank White

[Al’ Tariq]
Bust it, I’m shoppin Sears for wears that I can put on in Foot Locker
For other soles to put my foot on, but right then and, there
My vision peeps ‘em, to dirty fleece ‘em
Thinkin nobody sees ‘em, boostin
So I exhale like Whitney Houston, then start accusin
these tricks for their intrusion, exclusin
Mr. Al’ Tariq from your profits, you better stop it
Shorties hold to drop it, or cop it
witcha greenbacks I know you’re holdin, like the feds
Just some high-rollers rollin, I’m told in, your profession
money be flowin, but all I’m knowin
is my shorties, they keep on growin, so bust it
Peep the science here’s the plan - I’ll be your man
Give me what you can
Snd I won’t ever stop y’all from boostin in my hood
Crime pays in mad ways baby it’s all good

Don’t play, what, what, you heard us
Fuck ya’ll talkin’ bout, what, what, what
We here, we here, shit, Zoe Pound, currency
Wu-Tang, it’s all real, what I’m sayin, peace
Yo, yo, yo, run it through ya’ll

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
Fuck the Dutchin’, while nigga wanna run wit I
We can drop the funk down in M-I to N-Y
Where niggas run shit, sold off mill, we make a profit
Hittin’ the interstate, we all wanna get rich

[Raekwon]
Yo, straight up, break bread wit ‘em
Blow lead wit ‘em, chillin’ while we rap realism
Highlights, gangsta nights, straight suicide fights
We like the shilites, blowin’ off bites
Big nasal, bulletproof hat and googles
We just watch you, we cry off about you

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
If my man spot you, he only spit you and got you
I’m hot, you rock cops out the shoes and stop you
Screamin’ fuck the bloodclot, bust a shot outta two seat drop
I knew it we was bust, and word to logic

[Zoe Pound #2]
The bomb shit, ring the alarm, chairs bent
Like firearm, stays doors bust when the side in
Got in, scratchin’ the tires, insiders
Quick to found, crib, cards and the diamonds
We blind this, ready as the real day now is
See that kid, see that cat makin’ this pill

[Raekwon]
Money is the issue, what come around might hit you
Flowin’ your word, so official
Keep that silent, all real niggas wanna bounce wit it
Bust your gun and be out wit it

[Zoe Pound #3]
So cat that put me up on the lit
Round up all the thug wit a thirty-eight, two K’s and a glock
I was skatin’ he way, wit no diamond west
Me and nigga play the safe, just to build without a trace
Carried out buttons wit big face
Operation Zoe Pound, from downtown to upstate

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Yo, take that back to the cages
Yea, wit the mack to the gauges, jewels and the pages
Skate off, Benzes and lenses
Big wide Range wit a cigar, movin’ like menses

Guess who’s back, it’s Black Jack wit a sway crew at
I’m tool soldier from day, they never knew that
Cuz I play the low-low, kick wicked flows
Catch me Mexico, rented though and dilly, yo
I got no white connections for the mangos, call Premo
Bring that dough, I got that real ice flow

[Raekwon]
That’s right, we got eighty in it
All real niggas, throw a baby in it, whips stay tinted
Bulletproof jackets will blaze in a summer night
Rock saude in it, little hate it, in it
Let’s blossom, get up, connect, no gasto
Real ditect real, it’s real when it’s my shoes
Smack that emesole, wanna diss soul principals, blaow, blaow, ghetto lynchable

[?Omen? - Zoe Pound #1]
My niggas invincible, Omen is unpredictable
Bust guns for fun, under the sun, it’s a ritual
Third eye visual, forseein’ the critical
Fake mic fiends, ready to smitherins, it’s pitiful
For my niggas did to you, cuz they see the picture, you
Blow your game out the frame, thinkin’ they kissin’ you
Bitch ass niggas, I owe you niggas nothin’, what you got your hands out for

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
Take that back to the cages...
Take that back to the cages...

[Chorus 3X]

[Raekwon]
Take that back to the cages...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: ?Mad Max?]
Zoe Pound, Mad Max, Wu-Tang/Zoe Pound perfect combination
Ya’ll never thought this would of hit ya’ll next

{*Jessica Quintero ad libs in Spanish for first 29 seconds*}

[Chorus: KXNG Crooked + Jessica Quintero]
I came from nothin, I always wanted somethin
They told me I would never succeed, I would only end up dead or in jail
I’m free, I’m alive, I got money
I ain’t dead or in jail, nahhhh
I ain’t dead or in jail

[KXNG Crooked]
It’s funny how you niggaz think you harder then the hardest
Picture me debatin, no time to argue with you artists
If you do a song with me I’m probably just targetin your market
And then I take ‘em home with me and win that argument regardless
You hustle to be seen, I read that on a meme
I get paper and disappear, call that vanishin cream
Yeah I do work with the Slaughters
But I’m so on top of my business
that I’ll probably go harder as part of the management team
I just step into the booth after I executive produce
And I’m effective as a noose, cause hoes wanna hang
Cook me breakfast in the nude, scramble eggs, I’m sippin juice
And I still conceal steel, that Beretta is recluse
I’m from the Mass Terror era
You from the mascara era, so never ever
compare yourself to that rapper that’ll leave your New Era drippin that marinara
For a pair of paramedics to repair ya where you’re layin at
I’m sayin cat, get away from me with them Gucci sneakers
You ain’t fashion forward as Kanye, I guess we do need Jesus
I’m in my coupe, I’m rockin a few jewelry pieces
Playin some unheard Eminem, like fuck your new releases
Heh, my team can inspire millions
The flow been fire, ask the native N.Y.’ers
Like the Empire Building, I’m just empire buildin
When grown folks are talkin, quiet children (shhh)

[Chorus]

[Interlude: KXNG Crooked]
Shout to, yo
Shout out Jurassic 5
Hieroglyphics
Pharcyde and De La Soul
Digable Planets
And the almighty, A Tribe Called Quest
Yes, uh

[KXNG Crooked]
Let’s get back to the jam doe
You rockin with new friends, I’m surrounded by fam doe
That part is mando, I don’t understand yo’ ass
Get a little fame, get a little name
Then forget the same place from which you came; that ain’t who I am doe
Keep shit the same, for damn sho’
And if your dame, is on her best behavior tell her she could text me later
I guess that’s kinda boss, but this game made the word boss so lame
I prefer to be referred to as a check creator, slash regulator
Slash nigga that pull your respirator
plug, I’m killin ‘em cause this game keep givin me hell
They only want me selling crack so they could give me a cell
But I spit crack to let my freedom ring, now that’s Liberty Bell
Fuck it, give me a scale
It’s pure dope, I could sell it forever, who better?
Hold up, I beg your pardon - the mac-11 weapon spark
You get severed in several parts
‘til a 7-footer is leveled with Kevin Hart, 187’s the deadly art
And every bar is cold as the devil’s heart mixed with Eric Cartman
I’m the best in every department (yes)
I’m sorry, these niggaz got me hype, man
And this really ain’t the type, man
I listen to what you write and everything just sound aight, man
You better off a hype man, who me? Music is my life, man
Yeah

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: KXNG Crooked] + (Jessica Quintero)
We out here livin, man
(La la laaaa la la la-la)
Can we live... roll up
(La la laaaa la la la-la)
(La la laaaa la la la-la)

[Intro]
What I love about his work is they are completely conscious
You may like them, you may NOT like them
You may say well what about this that or the other thing
But, y’know everybody pretty much acknowledges he’s the man

[Jake Lefco]
I tell myself relax, don’t forget to exhale
Even if your breath smells
While some won’t accept you, the rest will
They’re the ones you want to let chill, let’s get real
Always keep your focus on your family, you understand me?
Nothin compares, can replace them with a damn thing
I think it’s easy to slip
Cause the hardwood floorboard’s greasy and shit
Half the people out there think they need to be slick
The other half’s just waitin on a reason to trip
I tell myself ignore it, can’t avoid it
You only get one life, enjoy it
Light your L’s, raise your cups
Learn to laugh at your half-ass ways and puff
It isn’t enough, I’m givin it up
Lil’ knucklehead young bucks, listen to us
I’m not used to that, but I’m learnin
Just look at how I used to act, wasn’t workin
I’m a person determined to change
But these things take time, I’m not a machine
A second chance is what a lot of us need
And my people want peace, but not a regime
I tell myself breathe, drop an LP
And see how the outside world receives me
In the meantime, wait tables
Get the bills in the mail, stay stable
Serenity now, label me later
When I get the widespread recognition and paper
I labor like a lumberjack, stackin chips
It’s a trip ain’t no comin back, that’s a gift
Inch by inch, row by row, flow by flow
It’s hard work, don’t I know
My freestyles and written rhymes both sound dope
This hip-hop shit’s somethin that I won’t outgrow
You ‘bout to see me rock a sold-out show
Watch, I’ma shine like boathouse row
I tell myself Jake you can, understand
Your future’s all in your hands, take a chance
You need to take a stand, you need a plan
Quit floatin like Peter Pan, be a man~!

{*scratched to 5 seconds from end: "MAAAAAN!"*}

[Female Voice]
Hi I’m Jake Lefco, and sometimes I wonder
WHY I RAP SO GOOD SON!

[Verse One: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
I’ve been knee deep in trouble, trying to stay afloat 
Pressure, pressure, noose ‘round the throat
Quick storm comin, you better stay indoors
Secrets, secrets, buried in the floor
Oh baby wants a new life, that’s what she might get
Pressure, pressure, a noose ‘round my neck
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn, to love you

[Verse Two: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
There\xc2\x92s a riot in the town, a wolf at the door
Pressure, pressure, poison at the core
Quick storm coming, God save the queen
...Wake up from your dream
There’s a riot in the town, smoke in your lungs
Pressure, pressure, blocking out the sun
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]

[Rap Verse: Mr. MFN eXquire]
My life flash before my eyes, it’s like a sequence in a dream
I died to darkness and got swallowed and devoured by a big white light 
It smothered me, staring at my face while they covered me
My soul left my body, now I’m hovering, over me
Thinkin ‘bout my wrongs, my rights, my ups, my downs, my left, my right
Decisions that I made and games I played, wish I could played them twice
An angel came, took me by my hand to the pearly gates
and placed me on the scale, where they weigh your soul for hell
Suddenly I fell rapidly, the heat of fire, smellin brimstone
As demons dance surrounding molten lava
Ghouls and goblins, waitin for my soul to drop 
But the moment I was s’posed to hit the ground is when I got up
Damn, bad dream... {*exhales*}

[Chorus]

I believe in the philosophy of Abraham
It’s not just a philosophy, it’s a movement
It’s a movement that will become, the international {?} of the world

[Verse One]
The genesis, beginning stages, to overcome it is so outrageous
An epidemic that’s so contagious, killing prophets seers and sages
Watchin all opponent stages, piece by piece right through the ages
Greatest minds locked up in cages, now you gotta flip on paging
Need to use it when you’re in danger, stand alone just like a ranger
Rollin over hot coals, bed of nails and other rocks
Follow in the footsteps of the cops and cy-clops
This vicious cycle never stops, ‘til you penetrate the golden area
I rise up in the air just like a fuckin Harrier plane
To see, which way the wind is blowin
It’s a, shame to me, how many don’t be knowin
what the hell is goin on today

[Chorus]
These fools don’t know the half
Cause they do not know the math
We just sit on back and laugh
Cause they don’t know, they don’t, know

[Interlude]
He has unlimited intelligence, he should be allowed, one at a time
You, you don’t understand, you don’t, understand
"Explain it to me, I want to learn... learn"
You, you don’t understand, you don’t, understand

[Verse Two]
That’s how we left but we’re not goin, roots go deep the trunk keeps growin
Sweepin time, from all the sowin, you’re not even close to knowin
Understandin complication, salutations to our nation
Strugglin for preservation, warriors to battle stations
Off, with the head, the king, the top
Hey, that sound, it’s your conscience hearin not
Now I’m masterin my grips, I see who slips, sink battleships
And tons of walking skeletons, it’s so disturbing, troublesome

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"Would I have to run"  "It’s so long"
"Got no time to hang around"  "Now so long"
I wish I could reach through this record, through this tape recorder
I wish I could lay my hand upon yo’ head
Sorta like Oral Roberts or Billy Graham
and give you instant belief in yourself {"self" *echoes*}
"Ohhhh lord lord..."

The answer, is in the next hour, on this record
Listen closely

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo ‘Pone what up?
It’s Shallah, you know I came to see you, boy
Boy-boy, the Vatican
Pain, Time, Roc 4 lid-Life (Nigga)
Gorilla shit, what up?

[Chorus 2X: Capone]
Chitty chitty bang bang
I’m on my grizzly for shizzy
I pop that clizzy, let your muthafuckin’ brains hang
Chitty chitty bang bang
Yo, where that 50, who is he?
Actin’ dizzy, nigga, watch me do my thang thang

[Capone]
Will I die before 50, tried to get my palms read
I’m dead through the eyes of a gypsy, bloodshed
Survivors move wise through the city
Word to mother, only a few alive off of pity
High ride, and a five palm clutched on a blinky
Other hand, pull up another dutch that I twizzy
Soaking a C.I., slow look out in the street
Few goons, singing the same tune walkers on the beat
Little niggaz that’s try’nna put Jordans on they feet
O.G.’s that’s try’nna get to Portland, where’s it’s cheap
I move with that Indian hustle in me
That fat cat, that world, that black jaded Bentley
Got bucks, but I’mma trynna get "moore" like Demi
Time’s up, don’t even try to duck the semi’
Only cowards deal with lust and envy, greed and hate
Chitty chitty bang bang, I blast niggaz who fake

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
We hold fort, blowing holes in pussies
Come through the town and it’s on
Watch me get the globe with crushed weeds
All my got it together, back the baddest bitches
All my flowing with Jags, and got the rags stitching
Play it for them niggaz in yards, the Gods come through in the nod
She’s reading the Korans, the Clarksmiths
Can’t tell me nothing from nothing
Touch a hair on me, and press a button
Might throw you out of a lady jumping
Yeah, we Niked up, piped up
Representing ninety generals at one time, looking striped up
Dinner plates, nothing but salmons and handlers y’all
Interstate, nothing but cameras and scanners, y’all
So when you see us, just believe us
Extraordinary young men, walk through the town, fuck all the divas
Me and ‘Pone, twin gambinos, out in Rio
With them big elephant guns, and fly ‘Zito’s

[Chorus 2X]

The definition of a playa hata:
A busta
A bitch with a dick
A violator of the Sixth Bar of the Mack Game
"Man, you know that nigga Khayree fuckin Mac Mall on his money, man
You know that nigga Lay ain’t gon’ get paid

Little old bitch-ass muthafuckas

[ Ray Luv ]
One mo’ time for the streets of Killa Cali
Grew up on the dank and shootin dice up in the alley
Back when niggas had names like Rock Tee, Chin and Butta
O.G. game from the muthafuckin gutter
I guess it was cool when a nigga had no riches
Cuz niggas didn’t p.h. and run they mouths like bitches
Much love for the hood, what up, nigga, where’s my homies?
Show love for these niggas, but they ain’t got no love for me
Jealous as fuck when I got love from the Crest niggas
But all I get is mean mugs from you West niggas
Now that I think these muthafuckas is so funny
‘ll peel a nigga’s cap for a trick-ass nobody
(You better check your heart and your brain, man
I think you niggas need to get up on some game, man)
Picked up on your ho, I’m gettin jocked by your steady
All I want the money though, I’m all about my fetti 
Nigga

You need to get some game and quit fuckin with me
Moneeey 
(I’m all about my fetti)
Money

[ Mac Mall ]
Now half of these niggas is falsified
The rest is full of mess, so they tend to hide
A lotta them is cowards who be actin hard
Some is tired-ass tricks who will never get far
Some is straight dopefiends tryina grind they lley
But they still pushin pebbles to this muthafuckin day
Some start funk over hoes and blame it on somethin else
Them niggas need to check theyself
But the sucker that I hate the most
Is the busta full of envy, mad cuz he broke
Every night he be stressin, thinkin that his hoe wanna get me
I wouldn’t fuck her with yo dick, she ain’t got nothin to give me
Cuz your nigga is broke, so hoe, I know you’re starvin
So you won’t have to worry about Mac Mall harmin
Your boyfriend and girlfriend relationship
I got my money and my cuddies, who needs a bitch?
Mac Mall will never get played

And you know I’m all about that money

Fuck them hoes and them niggas
That’s all I see in the Triple C
Stop fuckin with me

Come serve these fools

[ Young Lay ]
Gettin blimped with a tramp up on ? confusin what’s right 
To hide the doubt, so I grab my money and my lle’, high
Why do these youngsters by so nervous, 
niggas creepin thru these turfs
Plus these po-po’s tryin to serve us ill
But I kick back and just act with my fuckin clan
And kick that gangsta rap and spit about my gangsta macks
On rap tracks and spit for those that copy free
And givin they dap and tellin me it ain’t a day without drink and weed
G’s get stacked, now who’s a mack, yeah, the nigga shook ya
Ki’s of crack get cut down, but but not by the cook up
But yo, they crookers, watchin me all the time 
But I keep lookin and keep a nine by my spine
Or to my side, cuz when I ride you’ll never know
But if it’s over some dough, Young Lay is quick to let it go
And let him know, nigga, that this is loc side
Home of the mack, playa pros, squares run and hide
Cuz tonight we gonna do it just like this
But if your hoe is choosin, nigga, the mic’s in my fist
Some of this mixed with a whole lotta that
Old fuelin with new, it made my fetti fat

[Verse 1 - Big Unk]
I gotta get up off of my ass - if I think I’m a have me alittle bit of cash
cause ain’t nobody gon’give me shit, so I’m runnin these streets like a hundred yard dash
pounds and birds, I trample the block like a herd
gone off syrup, but I still maintain - tryna leave the game but the light bill due
really fast and them bills due too
crystal niggas I see straight through you, so I surround myself with me
took alittle time to find myself but now I grind so I shine myself that’s G - Game
never cut a nigga no pain if he ain’t never lived in rain
I’m feelin insane, chasin this change - while I protect myself from jackers mayne
all alone I go pound for pound, hard or soft I go zone for zone
lookin in the rearview at my parnta cause I know he wanna put one in my dome
take my throne cause I’m labeled the king
but I ain’t fresh off the porch I can peep the scene
I keep some - thing to put it on ya mind - gotta head ain’t no screws in mine
watchin the feds while they watchin mine, they can smear the shit - it ain’t stoppin mine
the bottom line if I wanna shine - off my ass I gotta grind
watchin the feds while they watchin mine, they can smear the shit - it ain’t stoppin mine
the bottom line if I wanna shine - off my ass I gotta grind

(Chorus - Jeff Lynn Repeat 2x)
Everyday I’m on my grind
gotta get off my ass money on my mind
like everyday, it’s like everyday

[Verse 2 - Jeff Lynn]
I blame society for life in the street
jackin they will and killin my folk
prayin I’ll ride on hundred spokes
I won’t ever fall victim to dope
wish a nigga could get my dough
try to play games with me and catch a forty - fo’
thoughts like this they come and go
who needs a friend with so many foes?
G - H - E - T - T - O, nieghborhood still look the same
you can’t expect the projects to change
and it’s commited to Weed and Cocaine
Extacy and Purple Drank - Dueces, Fo’s, Eights, and Pints
I spitt shit that’ll make you think, puttin myself at a higher rank
ain’t tryna make my soul sink, shit gotta defeat the whole purpose
bein surrounded by hearses, feelin my life is worthless - don’t wanna snatch purses
but I’m starvin so I gotta start back mobbin
put the mask on, then I start back robbin
make a nigga heart rate start throbbin
young and confused, head just bobbin
so when I pull out the glock, better get off the block
shit it’s bout to go down
the world is mothafucker, niggas be hatin because another mothafucker out here tryna shine
lyrically a clown, I’m wreckin the flow - always a gangsta, ain’t never no hoe

(Chorus - Jeff Lynn Repeat 2x)

[Verse 3 - Trae]
Yea, Trae The Truth.....

I’m still a gangsta runnin and mobbin for mine - and holdin it down for my kin
my brother got hit with a few years, but one thing I hate is life goes on
fuck it I swear this shit ain’t what I’m feelin, but I’m known to be strong
move to the block, sittin back on chrome - homie you know that I stay on my grind
I stay on my dough like I stay on the track and I come out on top like everytime
A - B - N my team you don’t wanna see the gang come out to play

Unk get the pump and I’ll bust they ass, get some shoes and I’ll rush they ass

(Chorus Till End)

Vado
The hustla
Niggas can’t even hate, yeah I beat the case
Yeah but I still keep the heat the streets still ain’t even safe
I’m tryin to eat I tryna see the cake
So I go hard like the lil broads nipples when they see my face
But you don’t even date your money ain’t even straight
Chicks leave my crib cross eyed not seeing straight
He gotta sit down and piss he ain’t peeing straight
He a fake
Don’t think he tough just because he in shape
Don’t accept the lies just cause he exercise
Don’t believe he lifting weight just cause he lifting weights
Don’t believe his gun’ll clap just cause he running laps
He had a six pack out but he ain’t pull a strap out
He may have gone to the gym but he ain’t pull the traps out
See never pull the gat out never been in a clap out
I blow cash when I crap out
I’m all about blowing pith and blowing the chick back out

[Chorus]
I ain’t neva been soft nigga
I go hard
Ah ha, you go hard
Ah ha I go hard
I just beat a murder charge nigga, I go hard

Ah ha, you go hard

You don’t hustle, you a star nigga
Ah ha, you go hard
Ah ha I go hard

Yo last time I checked I was the man on the block
Raise a mans in the block, took the stand in the spot
Hand to hand with the roc, roc
Hundred grands in the pot, see six grand and ran to the top
God damn shit is hot, g shock built like an army watch
I tote guns the army got, you can’t harm me ya
I’m on the darkest blocks, hopping out the hardest drops
With the hardest roc hoody low like the artist pac
Ducking [?] cops, hit me on the direct cell
I’ll be damned to catch the direct cell
I’m like [?] over the stove check the pyrex well
I can be nice like Cam and fly like L, harlem
10 corn rolls, [?] polos, big star in my circle like the converse logo
Ohh, I’m usually cooking up a couple
ya block be a dessert and you just be looking for a puddle

[Chorus]

I’m a pisces so the wifey said I be day dreaming
I never get up and get it I’m always day dreaming
Feder rally the niggas stay scheming
Checking Cleveland I’m here to make it a great season
Audi r8 you know me
I’m balling when I hop in the four rings like Kobe
Put the thing like I’m cas king [?] the homie
You can’t be that real if your whole team is phoney

Homie I was recovering from an accident
And I see the industry suffering from my abstinence
Did ya’ll know I go hard with the bars dog
And all ya’ll rap about is the jewelery and the cars dog
Or you can teach us how to dance but that’s all dog
None ya’ll are rapping quotable metaphors dog
I can’t even listen to rap without even getting bored dog
That’s why I go hard every time I record dog

[Chorus]

Can’t have one bitch I need like four
They scream my name at the shows

Bitch you know it’s Lil Boat
Bitch it’s Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a farry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us, damn
Bitch you know it’s Lil Boat
Bitch it’s Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a farry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us

up on the peak of an undisclosed mountain
an old man growing weak pours water from a fountain
He chose to live in the hills
got tired of paying the bills
sometimes he kills to feed himself
but with no harm on anybody else
During the nighttime he hears wolves howling when the moon is vibrant
thank god almighty he’s a lone tyrant of his own environment
His body’s starting to expire
can’t hardly start a fire
but he has the desire to be inspired
living of the supplement nature has given him
He struggles to haul the rusty shackles near the fire where the embers crackle
His scars torn deep into old leathered skin
truly a man with almost no sin
He acquired the name old man grizzly
because of all the bears shared the forest with him
His kind old eyes have seen many skies
but soon he will die from old age, an inescapable result of time
all he needs is a sign that his life was not worthless
and that he lived with somewhat of a purpose
the path chosen by his selection
gave way to many directions
One day he was chopping some wood
when the weather was good
an unexpected visitor approached who looked very sinister
It was a mountain lion with eyes widened
and a sliver of yellow
yet the old man remained mellow
The big cat snarled and he clutched his axe
waiting for the feline to attack
He stared him down with a gaze so strong
the lion knew to strike would be wrong
so he ran away
and old man grizzly never forgot that day
Five years later his beard is greater, longer, whiter
his body much lighter
and he doesn’t have much fight left in him
but in his mind the journeys just beginning
for the sign did come and he found out what life is all about
pain and suffering gives the soul a buffering
 so when you exit the human apparatus
the soul has had practice
and reaches a higher status
of understanding
life\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not all about demand
but something to do with the pineal gland
and the old man picked up a pine cone in his hand
and felt a strand of energy that wielded a force so powerful
he became showered with divine love
from somewhere up above

If you stay ready
You ain’t gotta get ready
All ready
Yeah, y’all ready?
Look, if you stay ready
You ain’t gotta get ready
All ready
Look, y’all ready, I’m ready
Y’all ready

I, I go for that, I get it
Came in this game, me and ‘Crae on a mission
I found a blue, that’s club livin’
But I ain’t see too many of y’all livin’
Seem like everybody tryna fit in
Livin’ that life like a highlight reel
That ain’t real
They ain’t tell you ‘bout the sweat they spilled
How they got no chill just to get it
I’m livin’ the high life (never land)
High art for the Most High
My wife in them high heels
Ooh, high five!
That’s nice
You know, you know that’s right
And I don’t got fans, I got family
I’m on my Chief Keef, y’all don’t understand me, squad!

There’s nothin’ left to say
I know where I’m goin’
We’re startin’ here today
And you know, you know that’s right

You, you know
You know that’s right
[x4]

My Savior is Jewish, my lawyer is Jewish
My stomach is Buddhist
I’m trying to lose it, but I need to chill on Fig Newtons, I swear
I don’t sweat the money, only the music
Now I got the juice, and my words got influence
That’s power to use it and I don’t wanna blow it
First off, rap lied to us
Y’all ain’t figured that yet?
They got the whole world tryna ball out
How you ball so hard but you still got debt?
I don’t respect anybody that’s trying to flex
Y’all lookin’ the weakest
Cause I was with a billionaire last week and the boy had Payless sneakers on (get money)
My homegirl started strippin’
I said, "Chill, get your degree"
She told me, "Andy you trippin’, cause you don’t make more money than me"
Well, you know that’s right
But some money always come with a price
I love this life, but I’m sure what I got next, to die for

There’s nothin’ left to say
I know where I’m goin’
We’re startin’ here today
And you know, you know that’s right

You, you know
You know that’s right
[x4]

You know that’s right [x3]

There’s nothin’ left to say
I know where I’m goin’
There’s nothin’ left to say
I know where I’m goin’
Nothin’ left to say
I know where I’m goin’
I’m goin’, I’m goin’ home

The impulse makes your body pulse beat off a beat per minute
As I get up in it

Block parties was a thing of the past
Motherfucker club hopping was suppose to last
But all I see, is niggaz by the mass
Fuck even bitches came to kick some ass
But don’t keep the club close that ain’t my fault
Take them back to a grain of salt
Take the ingedience ever since BDI went solo went solo

Yo that’s my word I’m about to take off
Break off a chunk of this trick ass chump
Who’s knowing deep in his heart
He ain’t wanting to see no funk

Ran through him got him thinking he can ruin

[Verse 7: Tek]
Chi-Chi bong water bong

See bad boy with gun, who must just be fun

Soldier from jungle never take back free shot’s
But that did them aat when man go on them flaat

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[First Verse]
Hey what’s up Pop?  Or should I say Punk?
You supposed to be the Pop to that kid, but’cha don’t
I thought you was a man when I met’cha but fa sho
I know, you far from a man, you’z a hoe
Duckin’ yo
Responsibility
It’s killin’ me you do that
That boy just made his birthday, bet’cha never knew that
Since you never gave lil’ man shit for his birthday
Do me a favor nigga, make me a license plate
Cuz I did everything for YO kid, you was supposed to
Makin’ sure, the nigga grows up, nothin’ close to you
Cuz if he did it’ll hurt me bad
I know that you’z a man, but man, you’z a fag
And, niggas like you givin’ blacks a bad name
That’s the main reason I’m changin’ his last name
I want you erased, out his past and his future
And if I ever caught’cha tryin’ to touch YOUR child I’ma shoot’cha
You’re mad at the kid for shit, his Mama did
And you done jumped out his life and he don’t know who the fuck you is
But you did me a favor I needed badly
You gave me your family and I’m the Captain here
Your baby call me Daddy

Chorus (uncredited female singer):

Don’t mean to be offendin’ you, but
Sometimes life is trife and cruel
Any kind of man’s got to understand
That somebody’s gotta do what’cha don’t wanna do

(2x)

[Second Verse]
Look at him, he’s growin’ up to look just like you
A sight you gone barely see, cuz you’ll be locked up half your life fool
I write you just to tell you what’cha missin’
Prison’s no excuse when you be loose
You don’t pitch a fit to get him
I listen to him cry, and wonder should I chastize
Another man’s kid
No matter what he did
But shiiiiiit, if I don’t do it, it won’t get done
Mama, won’t hit son
Daddy, don’t get none
Go get the switch
Send a hit if you wanna
But you should send thanks
Cuz I done kept your Baby Momma off the corner
Taught your lil’ kid what to do with his Pee-Wee Herman
How to survive this World of mackin’ by stackin’ what he be earnin’
How burnin’ bridges ain’t smart
No matter how far you go in life you never know what’cha gotta cross
I wanna thank you for the life that you done gave him
But you should thank me cuz I done raised him
Your Baby call me Daddy

Chorus

[Third Verse]
Look, whenever you touch down nigga, A.M. or P.M.
I’ll pay you to see him to save him from bein’
Confused about who’s father and who’s Daddy
Cuz scars like that, later on would bruise badly
You’re sadly mistaken if you’re thinkin’ I’ll be waitin’
Just to make, twenty-three to see, what’s shakin’
It’s enough takin’ him, knowin’, that we ain’t the same blood
And havin’ my other youngin’s and givin’ the same love
My main grudge against you is there’s no sympathy
For your people but they’re gonna meet you eventually
And when they do I’m gone be with ‘em
Rippin’ my ruger, trooper, Dad you done hit ‘em
Picture that, them four gone get’cha back
So unless you, totin’ bombs you better be open arms
With liable explainations and verifications for everyone
And don’t lie to my fuckin’ son
Your Baby call me Daddy

[Chorus to fade]

[Chorus: x2]
I talk to my car
Like Michael did Kit
I’m Alaska in Atlanta
And I’m iced when selling bricks
And I talk to my money because my money very funny
And, since I got that money all my homies turn phony

Say, I talk to my car
Tell my car to crank up
Then I talk to my car
Tell my car to back up
Then I tell my car to make a phone call it does it
Red and black charger
Black and red buckets
Pockets on extra
Juice man stuntin’
Walkin on ice dog, I’m buzzin
Raised on the ‘crest with a shout-out to my cousin
Right wrist retarded
Left wrist buggin’
And I got that loud back 5 50 onions
Bentley super-tall like your name was Paul Bunyon
And I got that gat nicknamed Obama
Young Juice Man 200 band to my mama

[Chorus x2]

Well I talk to my money and my money extra funny
and it sitting on my shoulder and it’s telling me get money
And my pinky ring so big and these yellow like some funions
but I’m bunkin and I’m boomin so today we eat with money
And I’m shining on the hater with my diamonds super sunny
And I’m trappin’ like afool so I’ve never been a dummy
And ever since a kid all I thought about was money
So, when I cop the Hummer the same color as the honey

[Chorus x2]

Alaksa in Atlanta and I got the white guys
Right hand cookin with mo chickety pot pies
Bouldercrest workin in the trappin green pies
Juice stamp chickens got me stacking bad guys
Big face 100s small face dumbers
Got so much money and don’t forget the karma
Big face 100s small face dumbers
Got so much money and don’t forget the karma

[Verse 1:]
When I first glanced at ya, I knew I had to have ya
Fly chassis with a sassy manner
She hold herself in a high standard
And hella suckers in the hood ain’t never ran in her
Young tender, thoroughbred, born winner
I know you’re busy, but you need to holler at your nigga
I won’t scare you away with fast talk and game
I wanna know if I can have ya, but I start witcha name
Who you with? you say that you ain’t got no mayn?
I’m tryin to tell you, girl, I let you star on my team
A play-maker, make a player slow his pace up
The type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up
She works hard nine to five, sometimes more
Cuz go to school at night, you see she got big goals
And I don’t wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along
Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old
See, let this truth be told, I’m tryin to leave that fast life alone
To find a woman of my own, so we can get together and build
A foundation that’s real and everyday I make you feel like a mill’

[Chorus:]
You got me wide open
But you ain’t even knowin

{Shima}
You ain’t knowin that I’m wide open
You got me goin and it’s showin
That I want you
You ain’t feelin me
I’m caught up indeed
You got me slippin and I’m trippin
Off the things you do

[Verse 2:]
You think I’m runnin drag, but I ain’t even mad
I bet you all my cash I be the realest that you had
I wanna treat you lav’, but you can’t see that half
I’m tryin to keep you smilin if you just give me a chance
At times you make me laugh, you got me wide open
You think it’s all a front, swear you ain’t even knowin
If I was runnin drama on ya
I woulda bend in the wind, baby, hittin corners
Instead I’m standin right beside you like you know I’m ‘posed to
Keepin composure, while most fools be in your face just tryin to get over
I see you know my style, me and my mob is wild
I hear your friends say I’m not trustworthy
But if you wait a while I shut that madness down
Proove to you once and for all that I’m deservin
Of your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time
If it’s cool, boo, then give me a sign
Now I ain’t tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me
I say ain’t tryin to rush you, but a/s, a/p
Keep a Mac on your mind and holler at me

{Shima}
See I been waitin all my life
To find someone like you
And now that it’s finally you and me
There’s no time to lose
You’re on my mind seven days a week
No matter what they say
Cause even though your style is wild
I like the way you do your thing
Baby, I’m wide open, too 
I’m lovin me somethin new

[U-God]
When it comes to this rap shit, not a stranger
Not Cedric, but I’m a Entertainer
Game changer, none can match it
I’m a Master, I throw on the green jacket
It takes practice, just to blaze mics
I’m in the best shape of my life
In fights with God vs. Devil
I’mma beat them charges, I’m the hardest rebel
I’m beyond your level, I’m stone and grit
Sit back, let me Quincy Jones this shit
Loan two bits, this is my territory
My biography’s an amazing story
Of blood and streets, love and deceit
Slugs and heat, let the dog off the leash
I’m a free MC, not DMC, no contracts, contact TMZ

[Chorus: U-God]
Here I come (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I come (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
I’m on my way (I’m the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)

[Kool Keith]
Tour bus, Orca, big shark walker
Man with the ammo, ya’ll bring the grand piano
Fitted hat on, superfly, walk around
Shoot around your town like Hawaii Five-Oh
Oprah come out your projects, I’m down with The Sopranos
While I’m stealin’ em, head so big like balloon helium
Guns with body suits, energize off poets
See the king of kings, I manage Floyd Mayweather now
Come up to the condeminium, and shake hands with the new millennium
Larry and Armstrong insurance, me and U-God
Any rapper come up, better speak to the doorman
Throwing rice on the city, out the Carolina box
Captain hat, finger popping your lady with the Air Nike shots
Heavyweight, dumped around my waist, I took it years ago from John Tate

[Chorus]

[U-God]
Rap hall of fame, ya’ll mention me
Got more bars then a penetentiary
In the next century, you gonna see my spark
My rap IQ is right off the charts
Go and front, go ahead plot
You got the biggest gun don’t mean you can’t get shot
Check my slot, check my melody
You can’t beat me, I’m the champ of this melody
Speaking felonies, that’s why I’m ribbing
Golden Arms venom, baggy jeans denim
Enemies, yo, I dodge for a living
And all these women, gotta stay ahead of ya
Ya’ll want ballers, the hell with the regular
Yeah, yeah, whatever, kid, gotta keep your head sharp
Mind on the run, ya’ll got a head start
Ya’ll know the repertoire, fingers on the triggers
We the toughest niggas in the yard

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
Yeah, for the shorty stacks listening, we love you, Nowfolk

It was around this time that I found her
Short and dope, laying low like a flounder
The same as Goodtime’s stack got stuck
I luck with meeting her at a show and I’m thinking "yuck!"
Now "yuck" mean good in the ‘Folk terminology
The aftershow eating with her, no apology
Well four tail came next in, well there you know
Needless to say, for the next route I was like "Yo!"
With big plans for the short-term future
Me and you girl, we staying tight like a ?shoop?
And then ?shoop? the little incident with her
From my boy, instantly made the ??? with her
A year went by, communication ended
But in my mind it was like it just got suspended
And recommended to be mended, reapprehended
And this week I seen her and I think she did splendid
Three times dope though as she looked last summer
Just sizzling in 80 degree heat, and she keeps heating
Her little squishy heart melting
Good God a year ago, again, I hope that we can pull it off
She’s a boatride away for the weekend escapade
Rollin’ out there in the Battle Axe Escalade
For the yum yum lemonade critter I love
She put my back in the fade, yo it’s better than bud

[Chorus]
Short girl, I miss the get down
Let’s make a prop(osition) like it was made to, get down, get down, get down
Short girl, I miss the get down
Let’s make a prop(osition) like it was made to, get down, get down, get down

[Ishkan]
This this year old Beanpole like him a short girl
To hit me with the good hurt
Put a skip in my hood heart
My hairy dick like the strings on gui-tar
And when I meet her with the five feet toober
She already off to a good start
With the tiny feet and a fine pooper
Yeah, the ???? package that she gets looks for
I ain’t saying that tall girls ain’t slick
And I ain’t trying to like go dating this shits, but
?If sliders ain’t gonna go buy low gravity
got the whole slide for a homie like me?
We don’t see eye-to-eye, but fit right to freak
She’s made off many small angles and tight degrees
With generous extremeties to please
And she my sqeeze, she my Annie
Playing shortstop and
Remember that the nicest things come in small boxes

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
She’s shorter than Wayne
with more jazz than the whole ?Ken Burns? collection
No sort of a flame
Drained the power on my V-Tec
She constantly keep my tape in her t-deck
She in effect!

[Ishkan]
Short whoop make my knees bent
To dance cheek-to-cheek and taste where teeth been
Every inch in proportion
Come on do your thistle, with your whole thing so little!

[Moka Only]
A fiddle with the middle pieces laid back after love
With the squares spooning, with this tune in my head
Make the kettle whistle *whistle*
Full-tilt for the alarm fire, heart, melts, she’s short

[Ishkan]
Like four feet four, maybe more
I’m embellishing at the size of the shell she in
So celsius that’s July sweat
Small fry felt you quick
Now there ain’t no helping it

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
One more time!

[Chorus]

* send corrections to the typist

[Andre Nickatina]
I’m such a diamond back sparrow
Illegal drugs in a barrel
After shootin’ cupid with his own arrow
Makin’ noise like SLOT machines
And when I CLOCK this cream
I’ma get up in your mind
Rap, GLOCKS, n thangs
And crash the party like the 5-O
But I didn’t come to break it up, I came to make the party way more live ho!
Situation’s fornication
You never seen an occupation like mine, and the rhyme design
Flamboyant like the Liberace
Blow weed like kamikaze
To the bitches that really want me
To the pigs that never spot me
Blow heat like quarter backs
Down at the warder track
I gave ya money for dope
You bring the quarter back
Indica and everythang
And when the bell rings
It’s like the twelveth grade, tiga man we gon’ sell thangs
Make trips to Hollywood
And Chicago
Down in the Florida Keys, and Marraco
My mother got a twin sister
‘Mean if I see my mother’s sister, I wouldn’t know if it was my mother or my
mother’s sister
Aim like a P2-10
Bullets that cut the wind
Brought up and born in the church
With doin’ major sin
On everything I’m in
Is how I play to win
Just the sound of a lawsuit makes a tiga grin
Cu-cu-cu-cut your body
Man Nicky very naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty...

[Chorus]
Man it’s the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You either hoop, or rap, or get your blast on
Man it’s the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You bring a sack of crack to the drug zone
Man it’s the honeycomb, You get your money gone
Makin’ cash so fast over a cell phone
Man it’s the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You think it’s jokes to crack on your funny bone

[Savage C]
My style is like a rifle
Spittin’ on rivals
And I put that on disciples in the Bible
I’m spiteful
Of crooked hoes, crooked po’s, and crooked crows
I blaze studios with nucleur thorough flows
Mouth runnin’ like a track meet
No diggity like Black Street
Lyrically we pack heat
Like jackas on back streets
Suckas is sorry like Atari
We’re hotter than the safari
Talkin’ shit like Charles Barkley off a fifth of Bacardi
Burnin’ sacks like Bob Marley
Hittin’ j’s like Iverson
Rhymin’ doper than Vidakin
Trunk boomin’ like a siracin
With more nuts than Murder Dog
We bustin’ like shot guns
Call me Tom Cruise because I bomb fools like Top Gun
I cover my ceilings with verses to keep things on the raps
And my floors with ajacks just to stay on track
Get it crackin’ like pile drivers
The microphone migiver’s desire to stay higher than five sky divers
And if 5-O creeps, they gettin’ shook like hands
While we slide out to the honeycomb hide out, like champs
We block journals while blazin verbals til’ our hands turn purple
You’ll get jumped like hurdles by Nicky and Nocturnal

[Chorus]

[KD]
I got spits like I had a thousand pairs of mits
We never slip cuz we all about our grip, Don’t trip
We’re the opposite of sluts cuz we never give a fuck
And we crush what we bust
Prudential city on the hush
Cuz I write the songs up on the microphone
Until the fights break out and all the lights turn on
It’s gettin’ rowdy like bar fights
Know nothin’ but hard nights
A Nocturnal huslter never love to play my cards right
So understand I’m the man in this
Steady chokin’, always smokin’ on the cannibis
Like the bodies in cemetaries
We stayin’ underground
They told me drop it like it’s hot, So I had to put it down

[Chorus]

[Pooh-Man]
Gettin straight to the motherfuckin point
The bitchs the hoes the money and the dank joints
A young player but nothing with heart
He wouldn’t think twice about tearing your ass apart
I’m from the gutter motherfucker
So I hang around with gutter brothers
Fuck around and get your punk ass smothered
Ain’t nothing but a homside
Fool you wanna ride
Let the bullets glide when you do a drive-by
Body’s dropped from one corner to the next nigga
And it’s Pooh’s finger on the trigger
What’s that you claming is irreverent foo
What you said about my crew was’nt even cool
So I am gonna point the glock at your temple
And burst that motherfucker like a pimple
And did ya ask me and I might say fire
Smear death on your ass
How the fuck you going survive
See I ain’t trippin on funk
Fuck the trunk on my lap
It’s the 12 gauge punk
So come on nigga if you want to try me
And find out where I got the title
Menance 2 society

[Hook]
Menace 2 society
(15x)

[Pooh-Man]
Hop in my K-5
Now I am riding through my hood
I am always strapped
Cuz nigga’s would jack me if they could
See my cousin asked so I stopped
Grabbed my glock
Got out and kicked it on the block
Smokin dank and shakin the ivory
Seems I’m kickin it but this nigga wanted to try me
Nigga fade me a temple but I ain’t no joke
Tennessee title in the dope
Now it’s money on hoe
But he stuck his foot on the cash cuz he bigger
But ain’t shit bigger than a 4-5 glock trigger
Nigga pay up but you gotta
But you gotta break off everything you got
From your nikes to you jacket to your watch
Take what’s mine no nigga I ain’t haven it
Gimmie what’s mine or I am puttin you in a casket
I’m from the deuce nigga home of the player
I’ll put a hole in your chest punk and would’nt even care
Fool’s must of thought I was jokin
Stuck five in his motherfuckin chest and my glock smokin
Fool should’nt of tried me
Found out why the called Pooh-Man a Menance 2 society

[Hook]
Menace 2 society

[Pooh-Man]
See motherfuckers they be faking it
But your life ain’t shit to me (I’ll take it)
Fools front and believe me I saw
But what cha feel like is my glock pressed up to your jaw
In ‘93 I am setting laws don’t doubt it
And if you ever seen my gat you live to did’nt live to tell about it
Full clips and shitloads of bills
And if I coming like that somebody’s gettin killed
1-87 is my course
Spray up your whole motherfucking crew without a grain of remorse
And I ain’t tripped no jail
Cuz if I’m going by myself who the fuck going to tell
Nothing left but a cross and yellow tape
Next I see these niggas it’ll be at a wake
So run them right besides me
And try me nigga but I’m a Menance 2 society

[Outro]

[Pooh-Man]
Hey man check this out
You ever stuck a bullet in a motherfuckers chest?
You ever watch a motherfuckers brains
fly out the back of his motherfucking head?
It happens like that partna
It ain’t like you see in the movies
Motherfuckers die out here
And it be the motherfuckers like me who be doing it
Other motherfuckers just rap about it
Motherfuckers like me live this shit everyday
It ain’t phony partna he way we live out here partna
live or die kill or be killed
So motherfuckers gotta understand you know
I’ll be whatever you want me to be
But out here
I’m a menance 2 society motherfuckin society
If a nigga want some of this he can have it
And I’m gonna give him every bit of it all at once
At the same motherfuckin time
It go like that and that’s how its goin have to be
But motherfuckers be faking it
Kill a motherfucker and see how it feels
And you will realize when you kill a motherfucker
And get caught you gotta do time 
{*fades until end*}

[ Kimberly Ball ]
Cause I can’t stand it
(I can’t stand it)
You can’t stand it
(ou can’t stand it)
Is this the way it’s plann-e-ed?

[ VERSE 1: Captain Rapp ]
You better wake up to what’s goin down
Your eyes are closed but your ears hear the sound
Death cries in the wind, the thought makes you cringe
He’s dead and gone, you lost another friend
Who was young in age, but old in sin
Gangbangin, hangin, he was slingin the juice
The skunk was bunk and his death was the proof
Another life ended all too soon
With a tag on a toe in a coroner’s room

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 2: Captain Rapp ]
The world evolves while my nation’s sore
The American dream is unseen for sure
And ( ? ) where you work ( ? ) company loss
The boss must minimize the staggering cost
You get a day off, a layoff
And a letter to stay off
And now you don’t work no more
That position at the plant you really did need
Head of the house, five kids to feed
You tried everything, and it’s just not fair
To have a able-bodied man apply for welfare
A city cries out, it’s mass hysteria
One wounded, four dead in a California area
Innocent victims found home slain
Relatives and neighbors experience the pain
They hold back tears, just got to take a stand
Order padlocks and guns in a heavy demand
The fears won’t rest until they’re all behind bars
For the rest of his life the boy will carry the scars
Best friend, mother, father and a very young daughter
Memories in his mind, loved ones have been slaughtered
Is there any way to compensate
A person’s life, so great a fate?
Heaven knows it can’t go on
Too many things are goin wrong
Who will save us from ourself?
This world has turned to hell

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

Help me, help me, help me, help me
All those odds, they’re all out to get me
Wars on Earth, when will it cease?
I’m bein robbed, so I call the police

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 3: Captain Rapp ]
Weather plays havoc on the eastern states
Floods, hurricanes, and you can’t escape
Tornados drop trees ( ? ) and debris
Leavin little behind but death and injuries
Gonorrhea, syphilis spreadin like the plague
Doctors afraid to treat the victims of AIDS
The world is threatened by a nuclear war
Americans die in El Salvador
The Pope holds court and hopes for solidarity
In a speech to see the people’s ( ? )
Begin meets Reagan, Camp David accord
And they say Reagan will run in ‘84
Bad education is just a relevation
But still each year kids regret graduation
The third world sends out a hunger plea
Genetics runnin loose, sexual child abuse
The Bible tells us it’s just a prophecy

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 4: Captain Rapp ]
Inmates emprisoned, life on death row
Guards, gates and ( ? )
Never really knowin will they ever let you go
While the courts are sayin: Son, we told you so
You’re a menace to society, a threat and danger
We sentence you to die, to death by gas chamber
Can man says it’s proper to take a life for a life?
The only real judge is the almighty Christ
A woman who loves you, she thinks about your plight
Hurt and worried, few visitation rights
Sittin home pregnant, considered the options
Driftin between abortion or adoption
The distortion of abortion is the devil’s strategy
Created by the economic uncertainty
Lawmakers who monger, lawbreakers in hunger
You struggle for power, we all feel the plunder
Terrorism, cynicism, communism, suicide
Atheism, animism, brutalism, homicide
Heaven knows this can’t go on
Too many things are goin wrong
Who will save us from ourself?
This world has turned to hell

Bad times - these are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[ VERSE 5: Captain Rapp ]
Headrags and khakis, dress code of the gang
Guns and knives and you’re down to bang
Your family’s poor and life’s a big bore
To survive in the ghetto you must be hardcore
You just kick it on the set, a job you never sweat
Cause a application form is too complex
Your brain deflated by ( ? )
A lady with the thought of snatching her purse
An elderly victim leaves her home
Headed for the neighborhood savings and loans
You tip and you sneak to elude her eye
You wanna grab the purse on the very first try
But your timing is off and you committed yourself
You say to get this purse you’re gonna go through hell
So it’s time to get rough, but she called your bluff
You pulled out your knife and you cut her real tough
She was murdered on the street, short of her time
Another little old lady a victim of crime

Bad times are for real
Bad times is what you and I feel

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Show a big timer love, when you see me riding Dubs
Platinum chain diamoned up but, (please don’t stare at us)
Coming through I see you, peeping me I’m peeping you
Find a better thing to do and, (please don’t stare at us)
See me crooked on the corn’, with a throwed yellow bone
I’m with her and you alone, (please don’t stare at us)
Ice tray on my teeth, big freeze around my neck
Better get your mind correct and, (please don’t stare at us)

[50/50 Twin]
More watch than a dope fiend, on my color changing ring
In my color changing car, I got color changing screens
Somebody’s watching, I feel I’m breathing from the sidewalk
Chamillion when I parked the car, passed him my mentas
Do not tug on my pocket, and then bug me about it
Cause if I got it to give, I ain’t stingy I’ll drop it
50 snatch half a hundred, cash checks and stay stunning
Exit my house with a gun, to go get it like I’m running
Eating lunch on platinum plates, platinum knifes to stab steak
Who said money don’t grow on trees, I rake my yard with platinum rakes
Pause, hold up, stop, wait is what they beg me to do
Its either Platinum FUBU, or Iceberg with Pikachu
Its the 50/50 Twin, twenty threes when I spin
I say you wanna lick my chain, she say you tease me again
No key to the Benz cause its voice activated
When my brother get off like, I know hatas have to hate it

[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
Here I come turn your head, why your girl turning red
You remind me of the type of person, that would turn fed
Turn your frown into a smile, she don’t like you take a hint
Turn the corner, everybody stare at color changing tents
A lot of money I spent, to make blind people squint
I tip the waiter enough money, to pay for his rent
I hog the lane, listen how my horn be oinking
My diamonds got more points, than a point guard pointing
I’m badder than some sun glasses, better cover your eyes
I drive fast jaws drop, and eye brows rise
I hold it down like Sprint, mouth looking like gold bricks
Looking like stalagmites, hanging off my lips
I had aspirations of balling, ever since I was six
My record’s like mosquito bites, every DJ wants to itch it
Every time people staring, and pow wow mix
They call a ambulance, to help em get they face on fix

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
When it come to riding chrome, we some veteran pros
Matter fact, I’m living larger than David Letterman’s nose
Don’t play stupid and act like, I never said it before
I’d rather chase a set of them vogues, instead of them hoes
Whoa Kimosabi, find me in a Denali
Or hopping out the Impali, if I’m sweating its probably
Not the damn sun, cause this heater strapped to my body
Whoa Kimosabi, think I’m bluffing then try me
Mirror mirror on the wall, I’m watching all them laws
So I can see who’s plotting on me, when my twinkies crawl
They staring at us dog, that boy Lew Hawk is not
The type to let some drama pop, and then sit back and watch
Niggas just sit back and watch, while we sit back and drop
Haters see more red dots, than a kid with chicken pots
If you want it its whatever, you haters need to go get a
Like we cheddar getters, for 2K1 and forever
Whoa Kemosabe, get you done bring corrected
When you see a color changing necklace, you better respect it

[Hook - 2x]

[Brandon Allday]
living in a cage breed hate
6 feet 250 would you miss me still hard to break
what the pain do make your brain do
waiting hating kept seeing thoughts until it came true
in 97 his own father chose to end it
99 his mother became dependent
(a few years later) 2005 at 16
what it like to be human wonder if god listening
he might’ve known for a few months listened to lennon
and johnny cash a few close friends but they all young
in 96 started putting cameras and guards in the building
I was there the same year felt more like prison
new years new technological advancement
but if the babies feel like criminals it could be more damaging
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god

[Brandon Allday]
walls leaking blood like whine
took a 28 year old father from his daughter’s side
they heard gunshots before teachers started barricading the doors
glass shattered cut sharpened the floor
looking like the walls leaking 45 shots bleeding
he was quiet bet them hear him now
but they heard a round - speaking with bullets
make life not long as it seem amplify the sound of death
what type of feelings he hold make him want to kill his own
now they sending babies in the helicopter lift
coughing up blood prayers saved the seven that lived
doctor couldn’t really relate to a night like this
said nowadays everybody slicing their wrists
he don’t know how that feel but the prozac bottle filled
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god

[Brandon Allday]
I saw babies your age where most spend their days
orange handguns in the arcade stood out more than usual
school let out for awhile flags at half staff
and press conferences and north country regional
walmart donated 5 thousand for the wake
so thats what they made a couple hours that day
probably paid for with all that broadcast blank video tape
fbi came and went tell me what changed
same day legislators came to visit you
they cut the funds for a new middle school
I don’t want to know who you blame bloodshed blood
all the same and I don’t accept death in vain
hotels and restaurants read our thoughts are with you
I wish it was all so simple
starve for what they never provide
make me wonder how we ever survive

[Chorus]
my heroes not yours you probably arrested them
your schools probably neglected them
they spawn thoughts you probably infected them
feed us what you feed us you can lay us next to them
fbi call it major crimes
babies making babies cry
everywhere my people walk stakes are high
I wonder what you say to god

Tu sabes lo que es un desafio?
Vamo’a matarnos!
O si no a esbaratarnos!
Y cualquiera que se meta en esta guerra eliminarlo!
Tu sabes, esto es personal!
Esto es entre yo y el compai’, Tempo!
Causando un desaf\xc3\xado!
Cu\xc3\xb1ao! Gustavo!

Check it
‘Ombe no, no tienen na’
Que mamones son
Va a empezar la accion
Sientan la tension
La perse vive en ti
Tienen miedo de morir
Lo que te va a pasar
No lo vas a ver, lo vas a sentir
No pueden dormir si no es pensando en mi
Jodio infeliz, les tengo odio a todos
Y juro, se van a arrepentir
Por tirarme a mi, ni a que a mi
Que no tengo reversa
A estas alturas ni que poniendose
A medir fuerzas
De quien vende mas
De quien promociona mas
Total, si yo ya me fui a lo internacional
Por mi que se jodan to’s
Por mi se pueden matar
En lo que ustedes se conforman
Yo quiero mas y mas
Representar el Rap y Reggae
Underground en la China
Tu crees que eso lo puede hacer el corillo de Pina?
No creo, Pili
Observame y toma asiento, reacciona
Date cuenta que este es el tiempo de Tempo

\xc2\xbfQuien quiere guerra?
Para yo sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera
Guerra,
Para sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera

Llego el momento
Que mi p\xc3\xbablico tanto esperaba
Tirarle a los cabrones que aqu\xc3\xad
No componen nada
Cara a cara reventarlos con sus balas
Pa’ que los recojan hechos cantos con mis balas
Uno es chota y el otro sufre la derrota
Uno mas que habla y cincuenta pa’ su boca
Oye, chota, por tener suelta la boca
Es que todos en la isla quieren ver como se explota
A una rata y de la calle aqu\xc3\xad se saca
Y es que tengo una bala pa’ tu casco y es de rata
Pu\xc3\xb1eta, tanto mundo fr\xc3\xado para nada
Todos quieren ver tu cara bien desfigurada
\xc2\xbfQue Pasa? Y tu no eres el chenche de la casa
Arranca para ya’ afuera y no te azomes ni por Plaza
En Puerto Rico ya no quieren a Polaco y Lito
Y los confinados piden su cabeza a gritos

\xc2\xbfQuien quiere guerra?
Para yo sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera
Guerra,
Para sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera

Se que no soportas escuchar mi voz sonar
Pero el que me siente
Sabe que soy real
Que lo que digo es por que lo he vivido
Yo no invento cuentos
Yo no soy de esos raperos que hay por ahi
Yo soy el Tempo, el quinto elemento
El de la cadena con el Buddha
El que mentalmente los tortura
Con liricas puras, sin corte en roca dura
Mi nombre es el Tempo
Y mi apellido es sin censura

Pa’ los que me tiran
Tengo el huevo bien parao
Para darle al envidioso
Que a mi me ha tirao’
Ay, Tempo
Hace mucho tiempo que estaba yo adentro
Ahora es tiempo de cazeria
Quiero ver la agonia
Y donde esta la cria
De todo el que hablaba y de todo el que decia
Tengo problemas en mi mente criminal
Acabo de salir y me la quiero yo buscar
Tempo, ahora empieza este drama
Dejame matar a dos o tres, pero en tu cama
Sangre, tengo pal de cuerpos en un mangle
Para faltan como cuatro para holcarlos con mi alambre
Estoy descuartizando cuerpos, picando puercos
Tengo un corillo de dementes que andan sueltos
Tirense que esta llanito ahora mismo
Para darle los honores a tu muerte
En el abismo...

\xc2\xbfQuien quiere guerra?
Para yo sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera
Guerra,
Para sacar aqui mi perra
Acabo de salir para que invente el que quiera

Esto es otra mas de nosotros para ustedes!
Mexicano!
Y yo, Tempo!
Buddhas Family!
Jajaja!
Jejeje!
Yeah!

[deuce - intro/chorus x2]
Cause I don’t wanna be like this
I’ve been running these streets
for too long now
I’ve got nothing that’s true
but this song now
but the further I go
I wanna go home

[J3T]
I fuckin’ swear that I care
but its hard when you stare
into the bottom of a bottle
that is empty and bare
all my desolate soul
in my desolate home
it’s my desolate role
yeah I’m here all alone
I can’t think of a reason
to get the fuck out of bed
curtains closed, lights are off
Am I alive or dead?
I haven’t shaved in a week
I always slur when I speak
tolerance at its peak
another fifth just to sleep
oh woe is me woe is me
I guess I need love
hoes ya see hoes ya see
I’m just in a rut
and I swear I’m trying baby please
Baby don’t leave
god-damn I’m a fuck-up
But I guess that’s just me
so I sit in my room
and I’ll cry in my bed
thinkin about all the shit
that made me wrong in my head
I keep trying to climb
but it seems so steep
pour myself a fuckin’ whisky
and go back to sleep.... bitch

[Chorus x2]

I watch my momma cry
she says ‘baby why?’
I say ‘baby died,
baby’s gone like a suicide’
I don’t think you’ll see him soon, mom
stay out my room, mom
tell daddy that I hate
that mother fucker like you, mom
I sing this shit for you, Danny, Sasha and Jordan
these beers keep getting warmer
every time that I hold ‘em
I pour this out for you
like a partner in crime
it’s part of the times
when you’re sick in the mind
yeah I’m sick, oh so sick
I’m so sick of this shit
Yeah I’m lit, oh so lit
I’m so fucked up off it
so I stumble around
til I stumble fall down
to this puddle of my tears
laying here on the ground

when you’ve got nothing left
you’ve got nothing left to lose
with my last left single breath
I’ll still be singing to you
so when you bury me man
you better bury me deep
and sing along to this song
because you’re broken like me.

[Chorus x2]

[bridge - Deuce x2]
And I wanna go back to the start
back where we started from
and I know it’s been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong
I was wrong all along

[Chorus]

1995.
Crack the bubbly
Don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t stop
Yo, word is bond

Yo, look who just jumped up on the scene
Pocket full of green, but in leather and all
I be’s that nigga named Jamal
Mackin’ hoes in the tight clothes with pretty toes
Kickin’ flows for all the rowdy bros and it goes, look
1, 2, to the breaker 1-9-9-5
Jamal representin’, keep it live
It don’t matter how I come on these funk raw tracks with raps
We bout to still make snaps
We got bitches for days, rich as it pays
Damn shits changed since back in the days, get money
And my mouth is where the blunt stays blazed
And I get dazed to kick a phrase to amaze
I’m gettin’ busier, leavin’ hoes dizzier
Than they even been with the grown men
Is he a straight looney type of nigga
That’ll drop the temperature?
Bitch, I ain’t really into ya

Chrous:

To all the tramp goldiggers
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
To all the misrepresenters
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
To all the bitch ass niggas
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
To all the tramp goldiggers
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all
Keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all

I drop the lines above your mind y’all
When I be comin’ on that ill tip
My whole crew pack nines, don’t make me have to kill shit
Uh, I bring the flavor to you ear
Smash and trash MC’s from the front to the rear
In ‘95 until, I still kick the ill lyrical miracles
Leavin’ rappers hysterical
I keep it raw and when I got the gat I hit’em all
And on the M-I-C I rip’em all
Yeah, word up, this is dedicated to my peeps
on 6-0 and 6-1 on the Illedelphiatic streets
Take it to the recently deceased 
H-Town, Tall D, rest in peace
Word is bond, as the beat heat up
Psychotic thoughts starts to lead up
I got the sauce to make the Billboard bullet speed up
Yo, word up, right on, Jamal gots the vibe y’all
And that’s the deal on the real, I gets ill y’all
It’s Philly’s finest behind this doin’ damage
No matter how scandalous they can’t handle this, handle what?
Underground sound, I stick my dick in the ground
And I turn the whole world around!
And blow the sun up, word is bond, we blow the sun up
Niggas they run up, tryin’ to stop the come up and get done up
Put your guns up, I blaze your buns up when I rock your spot
Niggas they all stiff when the red dots to they knot

Chorus x2

Word up, keep it real y’all, gotta keep it real y’all

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

I remember I used to serve drinks at this local joint
Cause I was broke but my focal point was
This wasn’t no regular bar
It was a spot where robots were ready to spar
And one night Megatron rolled in
He ordered Pennzoil
Drank it straight from a can
His plan was to go and get wasted again
Standing next to Megaman with a drink in his hand

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Now Megatron was
Rambunctious, hoping to lay
That lady from the Jetsons, Rosie the Maid
He said, "Hey, baby. Can I lube your parts?
We can put our metal together, produce a spark."
Now, she was praying for a man to defend her from the offender
Her friend Bender walked in and wopped, clocked, socked him in the jaw
Then he saw Dr. Robotnik
And Robotnik was about to attack
And Terminator grabbed a bottle sayin’ "I’ll be back."
Cause he knew Megatron for a couple of years
Hit Bender with the bottle and it busted his gears

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Now Marvin the Paranoid Android was startled, right
And he screamed, "It’s a robot bar fight."
And Robocop busted in to stop ‘em
Started shooting at Robotnik
Blaka! Blaka!
Bullet hit Robotnik in the esophagus
One grazed the shoulder of Maria from Metropolis
Before Robocop could say he was sorry
In jumped her boyfriend Wall-E
Wall-E rolled up, pretty upset
Took Robocop’s gun, pistol-whipped him in the neck
And everybody ran
He was fixin’ to shoot at R2 and C3PO kissin’ in a booth

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (Have you ever seen them?)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh snap! It’s a robot bar fight (You ain’t never seen them)
Oh no! It’s a robot bar fight

Once Wall-E got the gat, he went crazy and snapped
He had everybody trapped, and he started to cap
Every single robot left in the place
Even that goofy bastard from Lost in Space
Wall-E paused for a moment for a re-up
So I fled out the back with Maria
She wasn’t hurt except a scratch on her shoulder
So I took her back to my home and I boned her
Or maybe I just make all that up

Hop 
Yeah Yeah first string onto open this motherfucker (Hop) 
Yeah (Hop) 
This be your boy X-Con (X-Con) (Hop)

Hoped out of project houses into a mini mansion (Damn)

The big dick gangsta you can’t change me
I got game see and a dick big as an elephant
I’m hella bent, now pass the pussy cuz, i smell the scent
And if you miss out on this dick bitch you unlucky
Cuz I’m so good I could make a nun fuck me
But let’s get back to this way out shit
Not that bootsy ass flow shit that play out quick
I gotta come with the shit that ‘ll have y’all jocking
Now hoes drawls dropping, and house walls knocking, they flocking
Just to hear my flow style straight gangsta profile
looking sick ass fuck with no smile
The whole crowd go wild when this nigga flow
And when I hit the Door I’m leaving with the thickest hoe
That’s what the macks do, leaving hoes stuck like a statue
With this rap style you get attached to
A wack crew ‘ll fall fast when we all blast
and attack you with a few slugs in yall ass
I’m a menace and niggas finish in last place
Niggas be flowing and don’t be knowing they ass fake
I guess them niggas got a weak brain, I’m from the streets mayne
So just kick back and peep game
Can’t get with this cuz this shit is on hit
And don’t forget I spit on this way out shit b-yatch

(Chorus)
[Ron: The bomb got me thinking of some way out shit]
[Ant: If you ain’t getting lit, you better stay out bitch]
[Ron: The bomb got me thinking of some way out shit]
[Ant: I’m in the house with the motherfuckin’ Bad n’ Fluenz clique]

[Rappin’ Ron]
The chronic got me thinking of some way out shit
I’m in the motherfuckin’ house you better stay out bitch
Cuz it’s me you can’t fuck with, giving hoes rough dick
Now I’m back up bitch and i’m talking much shit
And i can back it up for those who be running up
Yeah, they be acting up, but I don’t think they dumb enough
To think that they can stop the Ron, cuz I be dropping bombs
And if you bring yo mama in it then I’m socking mom
But it ain’t gotta be like that, go around the corner and pick up a nice sack
And bring that ass right back, ignite that, so we can get lit
Cuz when I hit the joint I be getting to the point quick
I like sit back and stay calm and don’t choke
So let me hit that it ain’t bomb I won’t smoke
So get the dank, don’t get lit and spill the drank
Just smash on the gas hella fast, fill the tank
So we can go kick it and do some shit so wicked
like pull out my dick and watch yo hoes lick it
And those bitches, they can’t say shit to Ron
I stay lit everyday smoking zips of bomb... 
bitch cuz I’m... a motherfuckin’ mack
And when I bust a rap you know you can’t fuck with that
So admit you can’t fuck with it
Because the shit that you claim that you fitna do, nigga i done just did it
And plus I’m ‘bout to do some mo’
And I pack a tec 9, so next time you fools ‘ll know
We get funky like dog shit, and me and diddley dog
spit on this crazy off the wall shit

(Chorus)

[Ant Diddley Dogg]
Now it’s that lyrical mack so uh, hear it go smack
In your motherfuckin’ face, this ain’t no miracle black
It’s that way out shit that I be thinkin’ of
Straight mickey’s ice in my system, I ain’t drinking bud light
I love mics thats why I rips it up
And I love that hennessy too, that’s why I sips a cup
Every time it passes, I’m ready to kick some asses
If you can’t see that I’m the tightest get some glasses
But you might need bifocals when you hear my vocals
Believe it it’s true, Ant Diddley’s coming through
And you could ask your mama hoe, flowing astronomical
Me and Rappin’ ‘ll flow straight for an hour so
Quick to devour your crew feel the power of two sick niggas so
What the fuck you cowards gone do
Seven up to a gun fight, cuz all i need is one mic
And every time I grab it I’m guaranteed to come tight
So listen as I let it slide out
and for a talkitive bitch I gotta dick for her wide mouth
And all violators will get prosecuted
when the glock is cocked, bitch I got’s to shoot it
You say you the tightest but that’s not the truth
I got more brain than Einstein and more rhymes than Doctor Suess
Coming with explosive shit, niggas can’t get close to this
Ant Diddley Dog got technique, fuck them flows you spit
I make my rhyme sound fat got it down packed
Nigga pass the bomb i ain’t fucking with no brown sack
So kick back cuz Bad n’ Fluenz ain’t gone play out quick
comin with this way out shit

(Chorus 5x)

[Ant Banks]
It’s got your bitch on a long ass dick

[Chorus - 8X]
Got her toes done up
With her finger nails matchin’

[Verse One: Kid Sister]
Shake it up up
Rock your body and
Make it knock knock
When you’re partyin’
Take a break break
In the audience
Do your footwork break
And stop again
I’m lookin sharp
You can’t compete
With a champ
Steady flickin’
I’m holdin down
That ?
Aye, rhinestones
All in they face
Gold charms
And paper chase
Talk smack
From around the way
Gotta put
These chicken heads
In they place
I ain’t rockin’
No stupid bapes
Ain’t trippin’
I’ll juke all day
I ain’t slippin’
Cause either way
When I hit the block
All the people say

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this mutherfuckas jammin’
I’m on it it’s an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom?
Please no cameras
They gone have me
On Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods
I would need pants
Big as Hammers
I be tippin’ them dancers
They be sayin’ I’m handsome
I was pretty before the dough
But now I’m just the man
You remind me of my old chick
On that eighty four shit
Oh shit
Did you see the way
She got her toes did?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Kid Sister]
Girls be
So thirsty thirsty
Fast forward
To the end of my song
And say third
Verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try
To rehearse me hearse me
From manicure
Sets to silky weaves
They be
So grimy, nasty, bogus
Jermy, dirty
Uh, oh
Shol did
You ain’t slick
Naw, let the pioneer
Blast my ass
Wait a minute
Hold up
Bubble letters
On my butt say
"fresh"
Oops I’ma go
Nails like whoa
Acrylic base
Top all gold
Colors on my nails
To the paint on my toes
Stay fresh
I’m accustomed to gold

[Chorus]

Go hard
Facin sumpin evil, got a closet full of mason jars filled wit diesel
I’m all about the people 
leavin the perico in the 90’s wit the RICO 
cuz my lil niggas tell me that it’s pullin in the equal
Nigga you don’t want mine, I been on the frontline
Hotter than the sunshine, duckin from the onetime/yeah...
While you was workin on your punchlines, my whole squad we out side we go hard
They past crazy got anything to prove, they real dumb, shoot anything that move
Bring the heat out, pussy queef your teeth out
You won’t do shot cept lay on the ground and bleed out
Bitch I’m a problem, dare a nigga to solve him
I will semi/sawed off or revolve them
And We got plenty of anything you involved in
But ima ghost, got lil niggas so call them

It’s born baby I’m back, back on that real shit, I’m back g’in a pack trappin is real sick
I’m back baby I’m back, back on that ill shit/y’all rap niggas is wack, rappin that bullshit

Nigga youse a bitch if you brag how you handle folks
U can get your head, opened up like an envelope
Nigga this the jungle/prey on weak like they antelope
Halfa 1/4 of chem, get you more than a gram of coke
cousins did ten in the pen, now they coming home
To a different city, different life than they used to know 
The 90’s is dead, who knows what the future holds
was it all for not/depends on how the future goes 
I been at the bottom so long that the view is skewed
prolly just the glass in the ceiling we viewin thru..
This deez got me leanin to the side, like I’m leanin in the ride
Got crack under my nails, son, I’m feenin to survive
I’m back bitch , I’m back on this real shit
Live amongst the young wild niggas who kill shit
I told you that We keep it low, and we know nufin but indo
Mad cuz me and b blow chem in the benzo

You’re a sucker, and I rock
Wind it up) --> Just-Ice

[ VERSE 1: Threat ]
Fresh out my khaki fatigues
All you B.G.’s, you little leagues
??? run deep down in my genetic code, my DNA, frequent
Travellin, goin in and out, a juvenile delinquent
Meat-colored so you know I got a heart
Automatically, but I made it far
In the game, fame, fortune, get an abortion
You niggas want beef, I feed it to you raw in tiny, small portions
The lyrical composition has been composed by and written
Spitten, created for the part of use only if it’s hard-hittin
West Coast section comin through droppin bombs from all directions
Primary candidate assassinated at the ‘96 elections
I told you before, the war, settle the score
With heavy metal, the rebel
Takin off like the Space Shuttle
Makin MC’s smash on the gas pedal
Maintain, hold it down, claim the victory over the golden crown
Crowd around and history explains the names 
of those that fell off the sound
Overload the circummode, malfunction in the mic’s membrane
Radioactivity cause electricity in the cloud to make it rain
And have you wet, dripping, flipping, slipping
In the West slopes, Zoo Tribe representing

[ CHORUS: Tray Deee ]
Flipping through my dictionary
This is what we label as Gangsta
(Vo-Vo-)Vocabulary\t\t\t(3x)

[ VERSE 2: Threat ]
I prefer to take trips, circle the atmosphere and make chips
Then sit back, gangbang on you niggas with major clips
Championships mostly, put Hennessy to my lips costly
As we announce the new grand prize winners, 
Zoo Tribe finna take the trophy
Wreck shit give me migrane, stop, pause, I need Tylenol, Codeine
Extra-strength kill the pain quick ??? light it all in a flame
Let it burn, let that be a lesson learned, turn
Back toward the ghetto, 
had to blast past the last level to get respect earned
I received my diploma for bein no joke, no baloner
Just to let you know when you walk upon a professional microphoner
Rap creature, the Zoo keepers execute the beats featured
Transmittin signals through your stereo, thumpin through your speakers
I have to force the toys, not the boys
Makin all that irritatin noise
Your forbidden styles ain’t allowed 
Drop the mic, nigga, watch out
Tell them suckers they gotta bail, no entourage personel
Goes beyond this point, funky joint, toxic, chemical smells
Modern-day technology cuts like biology
Retire you and your co-workers, nothin personal, just company policy

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Threat ]
Trace you like when the feds be lookin for ya
Cause groups to catch paranoia
You can hear a 100 footsteps mobbin, that’s the Zoo Tribe warriors
Shoot ya with a rhyme from the past and sendin it to the future
When I wreck to play Rock Steady, you can barely beat the computer
Circle like the drive-through, pull up your automobile and park
Excuse me, ma’am, 
would you like to purchase some fresh produce we call the bomb?
Sick shiznit, fertilize the beat, get it pregnant
But that’s another episode of another whole entirely different segment
I’m zooin, crocodiles bite my styles chewin
Their style is played out, old, rusty, dusty, ancient, ruined

(Cause I’m a gangster and you’re not)

[ CHORUS ]

[ OUTRO: Tray Deee ]
Stompin for eternal with my nigga
The Mister Deadly Threat
And y’all know who I am
The Original Gangsta Deee
And that’s how we doin it

A North Avenue, 1342
While you at home with boo, I’m on the grind ho

Please do not make me mad, with all the ackin bad
Boy I swear I got some bullets long as ding-a-ling
And I ain’t only killing you I’m killing everything
So bling bling if ya wanna, I’m cut off jeans and a tee

Verse 3: Fabo

There come the police, knocking on my do’
With the GBI, said I was over the Georgia line
I committed a homicide
Running for my life this year it’s 2000 I’m bout to get mine
Started flipping the scrip, on the grind, all the time
Now it’s tragedy, cause everybody know what’s happening
They got me up at the post office, they after me
Can’t capture me
I’m a young gun, a desperado
Go blow for blow
I’m a hell of a nigga, they already know
I know they’ll try that’s why I got my vest protecting my chest
And I’m dressed in black boy
And that’s the really take care of the rest
I’m feeling distressed, I know I should’ve but do I would
Muthafucker tried to buck, that’s why I had to do it
I could’ve blew it, I did it execution style
He was on his knees and nailed his hands on the bathroom tile
I stayed awhile, and filled the house of evidence
They go through hell fucking with this Georgia resident

Hook: 16x

It’s on the map (uh huh, yeah!)

(Pastor Troy)

They bout to see a blood bath, A blood bath

[Pumpkinhead]
This is a Crazy Legs backspin
This is comin home drunk from a club, to a back massage and aspirin
This is Michael Jackson, when he had black skin
Singin "ABC" with his brothers, in Quincy Jones mansion
This is the best thing since grandma’s peach cobbler
This is the high you get when you first smoke on some ganja
This is the Cosby Show, when every dude wanted to be Theo
I had a crush on Denise and Sandra
This is my girl, for wantin to be my wife
This is track one on Stevie Wonder’s "Songs in the Key of Life"
This is the first time you heard Lauryn Hill
This is the feeling you get when your girl decides not to take that morning after pill
This is the best of the best feelings in your chest
This is J-Lo’s breasts, in that green dress
This is the first time I made out
This is throwin out all my Gobots when the Transformers came out
The best

[Chorus: various samples scratched]

[Pumpkinhead]
This is the best, the best feeling you ever had
Like 23 years later finally meeting your dad
This is that Sunday walk in the park, with a new shorty
lookin for a spot to spark
This is a drive on the I-95, in a 65 Chevy
colored red apple candy, doin 80 to Miami
Understand me?  This is that first sip of brandy
at your uncle’s wedding when you were young, bet that shit had you feelin manly
This is sex, with a girl from out of town
who broke up with her man that looked better than you but she was on the rebound
This is Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out outrunnin Pac-Man
This is Sourpatch Kids, Lemonheads and Cherry Chans
This is that senior trip to the dude ranch
This is growin your first plant under that ultraviolet lamp
This is makin your first grand off a couple of grams
This is San Juan Beach when you first set foot on the sand
The best

[Chorus]

[Pumpkinhead]
This is Malcolm X standin by the window
This is roadtrips for kinfolk bumpin OutKast blowin indo out the window
This is your first date, this is Kobe Bryant gettin acquitted for rape
This is fishin in the Great Lakes
This is the best, this is great
This is the best part of the album, this is God’s grace
This is Amos & Andy, washin that black paint off they face
This is the person that caught the Rodney King beating on tape
This is channel 5 kung-fu flicks, this is {?} hero combos
With two quarter waters and a bag of chips
This is that shit, this is eggs, fish and grits
This is cafe con leche that my grandfather sips
This is skippin the line at the club cause you on the list
This is G.I. Joe QuickKick that come with kung-fu grip
This is God, this is earth, and before I’m out this piece
Last but not least this is witnessing your child’s birth
The best

Pockets extra sloppy feelin like I hit the lotto
Floatin through the city offsets on the idol
You tried to keith sweat me like the chick from desperado
2 guns on me like the movie desperado

[Chorus]

Now from the longest to the shortest, twenty-four in a year
From the verses to the chorus you’ve been longing to hear
The talk story transmitted through verses we persevere 
We the presently lasting future first 
From the spear to the sling shot
We rock upon a solid block of granite
We stand over the plan to hold the weapon with the fist 
And heal it with an open hand
Feeling focused on the promise of a liberated land
And I’m just a simple man
Getting caught crossing the fire more often than not
The fire crosses us and the cross is on fire
Reminders it’s not enough
It’s been time to dig and find the diamonds in the rough
And then refine ‘em in to weapons 
To cut up the belly open til we all fall out
Cause the end of what it was is what it is right now
It’s a great leap forward kind of different from now
Still drop it on the one like elevators to the ground

Now it’s the turning of the page
To the second chapter
A tragedy and comedy so cue the blood and the laughter
To survivors of economic and natural disasters
Living for the right here and not the hereafter

A handful of tracks
Each a snapshot to capture the trials and tribulations
And smiles since you’ve been waiting awhile
We graduated in style
Congratulations
People of the word gather
Thank you all for your patience

Bom bom bom bom...

Life is a test
And you’re done

Testin’ me
My God is stressin’ me
My destiny
That perhaps so hard to see

In the morning when I rise
Every days on new surprises
Or blessin’ in the skies
And even though this world grow cold
As you always hold
A place in my heart
For me you gave me my star

Can this be
This world is history 
Why must we be
So bloody crazy
God help me see
Is testin’ me
This world is stressin’ me

Yeah

C’mon

Testin’ me (testin’ me)
My God is stressin’ me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

It’s testin’ me
It’s testin’ me
Why is it stressin’ me
Yeah
And so it seems
Is fallin’ apart at the seems
And all of my dreams will never ever be seen

Yeah

As I wipe the tears from my eyes
You ask me why do I cry
As the days go back more and more that

It’s so heavy
No no 
It’s so heavy
It’s testin me

Testin’ me (testin me)
My god is stressin’ me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

Bom bom bom bom...

[Chorus]
Where do we go now [x4]
When we can’t go home now
Probably get thrown out
Where do we go now
Where do we go now, oh

[Verse 1]
And I’m a product of my environment
That’s why these people buy my music when I’m supplying it
They tell me life is always sunny not ultra-violet
I feel like Bradley Cooper trying find me a silver lining
And I don’t need a, suit or tie to keep me alive
I just need a good ass crew and a long ass drive, word
Keep it moving and keep improving at the same time
People love me but hate me on the same rhyme
Damn, that’s just how I feel man
I ain’t one of those rappers who got a deal man
Quit asking, every milestone you try to conquer
I passed it, every album we drop some classic
That’s the way we love to congregate the masses
Your momma gotta fatty, it’s kinda hard to look past it
And I’m a educated bastard
Rapping is how I’m a get my masters

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And I never think I’d be a hero
Growing up with my dad and learning from Al Pacino
Jets fool, middle finger to all you Dan Morinos
I’m living in a move and feeling life Tarantino
Corleone, I’m trying to get my De Niro
Works some long nights and I don’t need a cappuccino
All falls down when you live in the casino
Uh, and I’m just trying to add some mutha fucking zeros
So point at Pelegrino, shouts to Instabeano
Shouts to Britain Rules, I didn’t know where we would be yo
Back then, getting dinner in Connecticut
Talking ‘bout all these rappers we hated
Then getting mad as shit, haha
Like those were those the days
We were living off the feeling
It was going our way
Uh, I know that life changes fast
But I would rather freeze the moment
Than go back and live the past

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I ain’t trying to front, and tell you it’s all confidence
I’m just trying to catch up to other rappers like condiments
Cause I remember when we got no compliments
Opening up for Sean was like my biggest accomplishment
I have my friends going nuts in the front
Acting like I’m hot as shit until Pusha demolished it
One by one we created a following
I learned a lot in class but hated being a college kid
And when I graduated labels started hollering
Work through so much dough, I needed a scholarship
Went to the bank, emptied what I deposited
Then put it into one mixtape, I’m so positive
I’ll never make one mistake, I’m so confident
There ya go again, rapping is all opposites
I don’t even care if I make it to the top of shit
Cause I’m a keep on ripping and shouts to Jesse Katsopolis
Woo!

[Bridge]
I said I’m a keep on ripping and shouts to Jesse Katsopolis
A Full House in it
Full House in it, yeah
Jared’s on the beat
And thank you Fresh
Let’s go
Crew Cuts

[Chorus]

I’ve been on my hustle
It ain’t too many people I look up to
I’ve been grinding, I’ve been grinding
I’ve been grinding, I’ve been grinding
I’ve been grinding

Look, I’ve been on my grind all week
I ain’t been getting no sleep
But that shit don’t matter to me
My momma said "it should matter to me"
She said "your health is everything"
Momma I’ve been road running
I just signed a few deals and the shows coming
I can’t let my fans down, I gotta run it up
I can’t let a bitch catch me, fuck a runner up
I said "lets turn the summer up"
All these other girls quiet, word to my mother
Man I put that on the bible
All this gossip people talking, man they got me fucked up
They want to see me down, broke bad on my luck
I don’t trust nobody rather do it on my own
Get them squares out your circle, leave them pussy boys alone
Leave them pussy boys alone

Niggas with hidden agendas, I hope you offended
Cut the middle man out, I need all of my interest
Cause niggas don’t have passion, they just in it to fit in
I’m really in this shit to finish, niggas goofy they grinning too much
Get the fuck out my business
A lot of these niggas, they was raised like hoes
You ain’t gotta be a killer to get my respect, pussy nigga

Ay just play yo role, you boys shaped like hoes
Y’all hate like hoes, we move different ain’t like those
We ain’t gon’ fall, we ain’t gon’ fall
We ain’t gon’ fail, we ain’t gon snitch
We ain’t gon tell, nigga
(Why would we do that, huh? You gotta ask yourself)

Look, I done been broke before I ain’t going back (naw)
Lil bro just came home he said "he ain’t going back"
So I gotta protect him, I feel like I’ve been neglected
Ready for change but don’t wanna work at no register
So, just imagine all that pressure on me
Man, this shit is chess not checkers homie
Can’t get to you, we’ll probably get your homie
Don’t get stuck in living in the moment
I was raised by real niggas no Jabronie’s
Said I was raised by real niggas no Jabronie’s
I’m a living legend nigga Kony Kony
Ridin’ with the woo, got my Kony Tony
Tony, Toni Braxton, or Anita Baker
Left wrist skating, diamonds dancing like Jamaica
I keep a couple niggas, but ain’t got a lot of patience
If I want it, Imma take it, ain’t trynna sound like no rapist

I be in the D, bake potatoes all like papers
I know why niggas mad cause I never need they favors
And I still rock with bucks, I ain’t never had a trainer
Miami beach trippin’ got the doors off the wranglers
Times get hard, old friends call you stranger
But I ain’t even change, I just bought something I made it
You should be happy, you should want to do the same shit
A boss is way more then just given out a paycheck
No music, couple old friends turnin’ the bases
I’m getting closer to God, I’m getting back to the basics
I’ve been had the vision since That’s So Raven
And I never needed to said things, I knew I was greater
If I stayed the same, they would’ve love it
Performing in my room to performing out in public
It’s 2k15, niggas score getting bucket
Let them pussies have it, make it feel it in they stomach, nigga

(We gon’ make them feel it every single time, every time. I mean why not?)
(It feel like, I’ve been waiting my whole fucking life for this.)
I’ve been on my grind all week (I ain’t going back)
I ain’t been getting no sleep
But that shit don’t matter to me
(We tryna fuckin’ win man)

(*talking*)
Yeah, don’t act like you don’t hear me
Talking to you then man, when I’m trying to tell
You bout some shit (man fa sho, fa sho)
That go down where I’m from (where we from)
You know I’m saying (it’s Dirty South)
Cause down here in the South man
(bitch we pulling out Ferrari trucks)
We do this on a daily basis baby
(we ain’t playing Playstation 2, Dreamcast)
Forget the cars, we pulling out trucks man
You know I’m saying (bitch it’s Atari, Pacman hoe)
Forget the Sega, Playstation we pulling out the
Toys nigga, cause we can ball like that

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit, if I want it I grab it
A new whip I slab it, I just can’t stand factory
I got split personalities, dumb play shit don’t matter to me
The baddest bitches are after me, but place take over is my strategy

[50/50 Twin]
Ranger Rover, 4.6
Never sober, do-do stick
When the wedding is over, hide your chick
My hoes overflow, like sto’s that got wick
Twisting fast, 22 inch glass
Screen in the dash, when you see me pass
Only get one chance, I never look back
Everybody in the car, be like who what’s that
Louis Vatone, excuse me son
What time, will my car be done
Don’t bother me none, need to squab a gun
One phone call, and the mob will come
Body guard is the Rock, get shot with the people’s glock
I’ma ball like Hardaway, catch a flat get a car away

[Hook - 2x]
You know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit
And you know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit

[Lil’ Mario]
Play stuck up is my strategy, the baddest bitches are after me
Got purple drank and dackory, guards see the boys in back of me
I ball terrific when I ride, candy blue sitting on buck hide
With a fo’ piece screen falling out the sky, everytime you see Lil’ Yo I’m
high
Weed and drank drank and weed, and a bad yellow bitch on top of me
Forever representer of the G.C.P., keep balling G’s surrounding me
Balling hard state to state, Lil’ Mario on a paper chase
Little nigga that can hold his weight, hit the boulevard and scrape the plates

[Lil’ Flip]
I got a watch with thirty karats, it cost so much I barely wear it
I got a date with Hale Berry (nigga you lying, ain’t she married)
Yeah but I’m still a pimp, I walk with a limp while I’m eating shrimp
I got my name on a candy blimp, I got a drop top six on chrome rims
I got cash like Baby and Slim, but I’m a juvenile with a lot of gems
And I’m still a baby gangsta, with a AK and a nine double M
I’m Lil’ Flip and I’m living lavish, I got a lot of homeboys that live in Dallas
I got partnas in Kansas City, I got partnas that gangbang down in Cali
I got hoes that be tossing salad, I got hoes that steal out shopping malls
I got a hoe to give me head, my niggaz call her Lock Jaw
You know what, I sold a hundred thousand independent
That mean before I got a deal, I been had a million

[Hook]
You know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit
And you know, that balling is a habit
And I know, that balling is a habit

Jayne Harlett was a student of the darkness
Writing scarlet letters to victims of her apartment
Let me let you know how her and I all started
It was a rainy brown fall and I was sitting on a park bench
Black robe covered her from head to toe
With creamy gleaming velvet lips screaming weary woes
There she goes speaking in an unknown prose
Maybe it was just her accent no one will ever know
Tried to look away but I felt called to her mayhem
Gave in figured one night pleasure but I was mistaken
Couldn’t tell at first glance she enchanted a romance
By inflicting a trance with plans to demand
Never look back leave behind past times
Leave behind friends and family
But I didn’t decline
Can’t rightly remember if she walked or stalked up to me
Unluckily I was alone with no company
Figured I try something take a journey
I was yearning for a companion I just came to Jersey
Just looking for a sensation
But repercussions caused cave-ins astray to relations
Startin feeling weird like what am I’m doing here
Maiden of Satan played with my every fascination
Lookin out through the looking glass
Everything started to pass
Came to an intersection with two ways but no direction
Took the path with no markings mentions or protection
Ascension to oblivion she laid me on the bed
Suddenly my clothing disappeared silky sheets of death

(Hook \xc2\x96 2X)
Ask yourself how you will ever know
If nothing is something until it starts to grow
But if that thing starts to fester you better cut it off
Amputate before it’s too late and you’re caught in the eye of the storm

The pleasure that I felt was that of something only God could give
Didn’t make any sense I couldn’t resist
She kissed me so softly so I kissed her back
That was my downfall now I’m trapped
All I could see was her on top of me
Everything else was gone
Just her and me
Where was I? wild night in the twilight
Like a fight to the end sucked my bones dry
We slept and when I awoke I fell to stigmata
My heart wept in the void darkness, start of a saga
An empty body broken spirit
A torn out of touch mirror image of demonic lust
Harvesting harbinger ring-leader of betrayal
Tapping into every stale ligament with her nails
Very trapped I could only watch these disappearances
Couldn’t help myself some kind of out of body experience
Sure it feels like your floating in thin air on something sacred
It’s when you get back inside and find your bones are breakin
Fall during the quake and drop another story from the sky
Now you land right on top of yourself and pay for that ride
Dark nights and darker skies with no moonlight or fireflies
Dire times fire side extinguished sight blind
But thankfully for me I was able to set the stage with the fallout
I called out there open the way to be saved
One night before the ritual started I dug into my past examined my previous partners
To be continued
Stay tuned

(Hook \xc2\x96 2X)

Yeah that’s us
Uh-huh
I think this the one here

Chorus 4X
"One, two, yeah and you don’t stop"
"One, two, huh and you don’t stop"

"Ah check it out"

[O.C.]
Style like somethin the microphone fiend would spark
Sort of reminiscing, of how it used to go down in the parks
Equipment ropped off, you can hear the vagas echo for miles and breath
Bass pounds the asphalt
Thunder vibration shake like a tremble from a earthquake and
O.C. a classic in the making, mental make thoughts
My physical form words
Hot in my mouth like a joust, no doubt
Some a phenomenon, mic technician, electrician
Spit the mic down the middle like an el producto
And throughout the resin, then asapoltin this shit
Gift to gather a rhyme, make rap a staired son
The way I do this, switch up the fluid
So smooth you wanna persuie it
I’m raw like underground sewage you
This shit for insight? Well I’m back, never was gone
What I right, be tighter than pin stripes
Born by mob boss, my flause in affect on the mic
Keep it tight, with out a fight is raw, it’s only right

[sample from live event]
I know it’s hot, we hot too
You ready to throw down, we ready to have a party
So if ya ready to have a party, make some noise!

[O.C.]
Any mic I hold it in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd
Dictatin shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic schoolin
Bringin samatics to this rap shit
Bonafied, mic set you can’t see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live, a life and die until then
Imma keep on writin the slick rhymes with the pen
Take the cherry from a tree, like a virgin havin innocence
Bust my nuts, bringin rhymes to live like Genesis
But ritical renaissance
In death there’s a flautless
Tearin shit up when it comes to me pickin up a cordless
One of New York’s finest, on this trip I co-incide with B Minus
Bringin out the best in me, we formulatin like a recipe
What I emplore, will show nuff disto my presence
Then I’m divine like the seven
Keepin it tight cuz what safice is raw nigga, it’s only right

Chorus 4X

[O.C.]
Microphone’s I melt down, slap crowns, push em out of bounds
Crush ya crowd, as I lay my third verse down
Because, this is what I want, to gain control of that position
It’s only right, that I follow thru compition
Be warning me, homocide rhymes or mad rounds
To get flass or pencil hurt, battin me down
Contents flex text expert, since my born date
5/13/71 like a stick bin, injection
Inside ya blood stream, digest what I manifest
O.C., you best by me, others are mediocre like
I slam the earth like a meteor right
Cuz I’mma take mine, leavin you face down in the puddle
Blow up like a shuttle, when I give you my rebuttle
Frame of mind, across state lines
Await the taste, me like fine wines from Avidian
For those who wanna select cyphers to cyphers stash
Straight up, I don’t rhyme for niggas
I prove myself, stylin for years on the mic
On another level of being, what’s the B Minus? It’s only right

Chorus 4X

I don’t know how you buy yours but that’s how I like mine
Think girls don’t style, how ya figure
One arm’s on my steering wheel, the other arm’s around my nigga
This pocket’s phat, don’t get offended cause
Somebody makes it so somebody’s gotta spend it
I take it from the boardroom to the boulevard
Troopin’ all the players like I play cards
I pump up my Jeep and get hot
And once I put my tape in the slot my speakers hit the jackpot
Time time for some action, I got to be the main attraction
Blowin’ up like Toni Braxton
Pick my girls up to check the party uptown
I leave my shorty home cause I’m tryina fuck around
At the sportsbar, honeys everywhere are lookin’ mink
What’s up star, let’s get a drink

Chorus:

What’s up star, I’d like to get to know who you are
Let’s have drinks at the bar
What’s up star, I’d like to get to know who you are
And if I like what I see then the drinks is on me

Well is it you or is it me, uh, I saw you glancin’
I peeped you from the door and on the floor when you was dancin’
This is the pick up line, I got the big up mine
I’m steppin’ to ya like a stick up
I don’t have to drop on ya 
So let’s go get a drink on the low and kick in in the corner
To the bar start walkin’ and I’ma hit you off
On some of that good shit I was talkin’
I hope to keep you interested, you should get with this kid
And if you lucky you could hit this
But don’t get souped, it’s just a conversation at the bar star
And if ya slip you get the scissor

Chorus

Cuties everywhere I turn, when am I gonna learn
I be outta control, I see what I want and I roll
I get the digits quick from the honeys, they be fly and all that
But right now that’s not where my head is at
Over and over again I step off quickly with my friends
To put this little love shit to a dead end
I got to stay on point, checkin’ the honey with a tag
I got to bag my next chick
And there he is lookin’ kosher, posin’ like a poster
I won’t bite come a little closer
I wanna talk but it’s loud shit
And it’s gettin’ kinda hot in this crowd shit
So step over to the bar, and let’s kick that lingo
I like to mingle, honey are ya single
If I give you the OK that means I like what I see
What’s up star drinks is on me

Chorus

Sex on the beach and gin & juice
Nobody likes tea it makes me get loose
A glass of Moet and Alize
Cause this type of shit happens every day

Yeah
You heard the Canibus thing?
Well this is the chorus
MCXP 2012 Chords and Locusts

Chords and locusts
Seventeen wizened elvish magi berserk off the hay
Chords and locusts
Seventeen wizened elvish...fuck
Seventeen wizened elvish magi berserk off the hersch
Chronic weed addiction blame it then U say legalise it
Tax it
I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m glad you think this is about you man I’m in legal shit
Mental torture this is off another patient
Still waiting impatiently impatiently waiting
Clean beheaded by shuriken and clean soiled self Pastrei
Bruce lee is back but I’m not gonna say what style he’s brought back
Threat of violence bring it a known carrot fuck it its the uncharmed snake shit
I’m the stick
Violent reactionist
Violins or pianist VIP should be

Yeah, I know it’s an unusual beat, man
Seventy percent of my fans disappeared in under one minute
Like when I run out of money on reverbnation.com
Like they got more love for herpes man
MCXP
I wanna spit a couple hundred bars man ill prolly pass out and shit , nah, cool
Turn the beat up a little bit, man
If I make telepathic contact with humans Gandalf comes around and I put names to faces like 256
The forbidden manuscript
I could tell you what\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s in it but I’m afraid it’s forbidden
Oh the guilt
Nah
Man this is worse than the Book Of Rhymes Out-takes
But
Not tortured by me but tortured as ‘you’ ordered?
Funny enough I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m thinking lightning and listening to Doom on Doom
Funnier than living hell then she makes contact saying stuff like \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chi Rog
Hows it going with Lizzie?\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d
Cos everyone knows that one
Man one more time
If I concentrate on something else she misses me
We got one of your songs in common
But she might not know it
On some battling shit
For example, ‘Bis
It’s a way of avoiding legals
Shit is lethal
Chess with ‘C’ starts unintended usually
Anything but boards
But why do you cry to Charlotte and not me?
About MF MF CH
She took your life apart man-she-do
Man I’m crying internally eternally
And you’re crying inside me
And I’m crying inside that
Outside straight raining
The typical expected reaction to listening to your beats
Is bursting into tears
Teared and torn apart by beatings
Being obsessed with the ‘b’ on the squire shit
Shit, right
Powers telekinetic temporarily taken by Bob Frisell
I’m no-one and the latest Nas got 3 self-sub-subliminal and it ain’t hard to tell, or sell
Put it out on the radio like stubbing spliffs out on a shitty Hitachi
One Stop, the experience doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t stop one from being
Still taken as Tauran supply teacher from Tau Ceti, like
(????????) tau satellite
Where’s he from?
Well we’ll give you anything
Things considered a little different
As the kids test stage one
The fact I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99m schizophrenic paranoid
Schizo berserk off the wizard, berserk off the hashish, off the beers
And off some certain other shit, Right On
Well I’m stil on the Tylenol Dragon Breath
And those with breath disease complain when I’m around
Breath is that deceased
The voices say I don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t have voices
Surround sound like I have a really nice environment
The chevron
Captain only rank in fact confirmed middling rank
Liverpool or Saints, England emperor
facing’ Bolton non-brigand Brigadier, and knaves
These are krazy krazy krazy krazy knights
Spray painted plate armour auras of chivalry
but it’s so unwanted in the modern age
Sir Galahad is writing about female chivalry
he got dumped for holding a door open for the bitch
Yeah, whatever man
That, I’m afraid, Sir, is mutiny
Well mutiny it is
On an Aero or a Wispa let alone a Bounty
Man
I’m never gonna be able to freestyle a couple hundred bars
So I’m just gonna read some stuff off the laptop
Peace to you and your Brethren

(AZ talking)
Yeah, it’s Brooklyn, BK
As we know, uh-huh-huh
Welcome into our world, welcome
Sosa of the game, A to the Z
Daddy Rose, Amilion, feel me

[AZ]
Its BK fo’reala, niggas stay guerilla
Respect game, if not, respect these flames
I’ma throw shots to niggas, respect the name
It’s Brooklyn, we on top of the food chain
And it’s only for this mothafucking game we came
I can get down with niggas and let off rounds
Or head outta town with niggas and set up grounds
However it goes down, I’ma shut shit down
The streets got me on some I don’t give a fuck now
Too straight, I’m back out with two big gauge
And can’t wait for a mothafucka to screw they face
I’m so thirsty and won’t show no mercy
Dust out severely, so don’t urk me
Dunlap’s on the red drop, ready to pop
Lock shop on the whole block, ready or not
Its Brooklyn

(Chorus) Saulhaudin
From Brownsville to East New York, guns talk
From Fort Greene to Bed-Stuy, niggas die
From Bushwick to Flatbush, wigs push
The land where the killers dwell
From Brownsville to East New York, guns talk
From Fort Greene to Bed-Stuy, niggas die
From Bushwick to Flatbush, wigs push
The land where the killers dwell
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Daddy Rose]
Welcome to the jungle where hope crumbles, dope bundles
Niggas rise to the top and fall off, smoke jumbles
I’m from the grimy soil
My crimey’s bag coke in aluminum foil
Ready rocking man his jaws, that’s where the water boil
Diesel stashed in the right so it won’t spoil
The land of the unloyal, whoever getting the most scrilla
Niggas will gun fo’ ya
Better have your hammer cocked; niggas will come fo’ ya
The home of Tyson, the Brooklyn house
Face slicing, mean mugging, screw faces
Bang at each other all night, sticking up new faces
Catch a new cases; 1-800-COP-SHOT, Central Booking
Remove shoe laces, hoochies, hookers and hotties
Blood, Crips, Godbodies, nines, grenade, hump shotties
On the roof is where they dump bodies
I represent Brownsville nigga; Welcome to Brooklyn

(Chorus) Saulhaudin

[20 Grand Pikasoe]
Click your heels three times and if you wind up here
You gotta pay a toll shorty
You would think my mack at hands the way it hold forty
Ain’t no smile on my face, we the grittiest
You in denial, call a jake
These two twin Desi will have your child on the wakes
You ain’t balling, you outta bounce
Before the player from the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers
Where the pitchers on the mound snorting ye’
And my son Ricardo moving quarter pounds, everyday
Somebody tell this kid, I don’t understand this understanding
But I move wit a cannon and I blame where he standing
Lift him off the canvas, fuck asking, I’m demanding
When the gat spit, leave ‘em gasping for an ambulance
If it wasn’t for this rap shit I’d be in the back strip, scrabbling
Or in the strip spot wit a black fifth, gambling
It’s Pikasoe; Welcome to Brooklyn

[Amil]
Uh, uh, uh, Amilion
Yo, petite like a sword off double-barrel
Yo, find this bitch up in some ROC apparel
I’m the best kept secret of all times
Fire, the only thing you can call mine
And, just for the record lyric’s all mine
Yo, bitches know when to draw the line
Amilion never babysit the mic
I’m the type of bitch you can maybe get to like
Uh, but Berlin at the Penske’s
When the market rate was 28 in the v
20 Uptown, now we pushing Bentley’s around
Look how many niggas Brooklyn stay shutting down
I’m one of BK’s finest, rocking all the hot designers
Clique been sick since mine
Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy, nigga come find us
Yeah, this joint here is just a reminder, nigga

Woah, woah, woah

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I’m a general, little nigga I’m a general
I can fuck a sack up cause the money plentiful
I’m a general, little nigga I’m a general

In cool with Snoop and now we groovin up the blocks
Headed up the spot and now we bout to get T’ka

Ke’Noe

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain’t Shit

[Verse 2: Ke’Noe]
My uncle Snoopy told me nephew watch out for these hoes
They call me cute but that shit don’t even matter no more
I’m like new money, when they come through they be catching a fit
We call ‘em gold diggers and groupies, cause they loving a dick
Now follow me as I take you back to my life as a mack
I was a scardy little nigga wearing baseball caps
And every girl up in the city knew that I had snaps
I used to slam niggaz wives and they gon take me to nap
They like a G with the big bank and tight ass ride
They like to smoke up all your weed and try to ruin your hide
I been a mack baby, since I was 10 years old
And now i’m in my early 20’s now, i’m still mackin these hoes
I’m a million dollar nigga, so I treats myself
They oughta ban gold diggin cuz it’s bad for your health
Snoop, you the player of the year so i’m the mack of the year
That’s the end of my freestyle, and i’m out this biatch

[Chorus 2x: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain’t Shit
I said it before and I say again
Nigga, shit bitches ain’t shit
They only fuckin with a nigga cuz a nigga got bread

* 22 seconds of skit before lyrics *

[Ruck]
Aiyyo I’m Sean Price, I’m six foot one
Dark skinned, stocky build, with a big gun
Six sons on the ones with the lump sums
Stick guns, get funds, make your chick run
My chick done said she like the way I toke blunts
drink liquor write scriptures and my gold fronts
Plus the way my pants hang make her wonder how
my baggy jeans stay up, baby I’m well endowed
See it’s all, I know you wasn’t expectin that
or figure Ruck messin with chicks makin executive trap
They get better than that, she don’t care who I bomb
Long as I treat her right and bring my black ass home

[Rock]
Hehehehehehe, look at shorty right there
* whistling * I’m baggin that son

Hey, the name is Alban baby, but call me what you wanna
Nowhere near, I blew up some call me Rockness Monstah
I’m the, heathen you was warned about by your momma
that’ll never love you as much as I love my marijuana
Hang out from sundown to sun up, startin a ton of drama
with thugs, snake me one time they will harm ya
Still you goodie-goodie chicks be all attracted to my karma
Let’s be friends some other time right now I’m tryin to get behind ya
She responded, she better stop listenin to momma
Love my rugged steez and my whole aura was the bomber
Asked to see my scar and taxed it, felt my six pack then asked
if she could drink it, blew my grill before I hit that
Hehehehehe

[Ruck]
Stroh’s?  All that then?
C’mon man, that ain’t no good girl
What’s wrong with you man?

[Rock]
Is you stupid?
That IS a good girl BWOYY!

[Ruck]
I know I got a good woman, on my team
I used to have five chicken and I tricked mad cream
But the first one I met yo she was actin wack
And the second one got dissed cause she was smokin smack
But the third was a herb, you could tell that she’s
on some bull, cause she flipped when she smelled my weed
But the fourth one, heard the PJ’s looked mean
Got with the fifth chick, because she couldn’t clean

[Rock]
My question is, why do nice chicks love rugged dudes?
The whole thought puzzles me, I’m just glad they do
They got they own little -- "I like these upside down 304’s"
Silly rabbit -- tricks give up all they do
Not I, hell nah yo, check my track record, bravo
Don’t eat coochie shorty understand I’m too macho
Daytime act like saints -- but they can’t fool me
G the freak come out of them at night like we Whodini
Hehehehehe, "The Freaks Come Out at Night"

[Ruck]
Tell you somethin about freaks dog, yaknahmean?
Sup, shorty, yo, word up son
I met shorty on the ave son
Right there by White Castle
Word she talkin bout 40 dollars son
I was like man, I gave her two dollars right and I said
"Yo, you take one ? right, and brush your teeth first"
Hahahaha, yaknahmsayin after she did that

[Rock]
Man you stupid man, get out of here, get out of here, yo
Big up to all my Black Fonzirelliz in the house

* originally slated for "Foolish Loco Youngster"

[Young Brown]
Yeah

Money on my head

Money on my head
Ese Daz

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
Get down on it, jump inside
Six-four low low, everytime I ride
We just cruise down the block with the gangsta lean
Sunroof top
You know it don’t stop
We got it locked from the Gate to the H.A.
Latino players puttin’ it down in a major way
110 South to the top with the rooftop
And everytime we rock a show, you know we blow the roof up
Hot tracks con la lady, cars in barrio
Bumpin’ out the system of the caros in the calles, holmes
Only in L.A.
Where we got the bomb weed
Finest bitches, home of lowriders and palm trees
So have a toast with me
Or light it up, homie
Whatever you wanna do, as long as we party, homie
I take the girl with the green eyes and big ass
So what’s it gonna be
Let’s keep it low key

Chorus: Young Brown
She wanna hang with me
I know you got a man, we can stay low key
We’ll floss through the city on the night, we creep
Baby
It’s on you, we do what we players do

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Young Brown]
You don’t even know my name
I’m off the Gate, with a plan, up with my fans
You wanna get
Down, cause you know we movin’ game
You got a man, but why hold back, you want romance
Somethin’ really I don’t plan to give you
I’m doin’ my thang, and if I’m with you
All my fan’s leave you
Tellin’ me, "Girl, I don’t want to leave you"
Hold my hand, you got a man, how can I believe you
Girl, you know you chasin’ a dream you never even had
Girl, you told me that you love me
I’ll make you take it back
You told me to be honesto
That’s why I look into your eyes
Es todo nothin’, say "Aqui, no hay sentimientos"
Yo lo te miento
Yo le halimiento
With these money makin’ movimientos
See, I can’t take you where I wanna go
But hey now
I’ll be right back, girl, we can hang out

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Ese Daz]
Ese Daz is a name
I’m just an international player
Tryin’ to get paid
I love all women, any color, any race
Mexicano, Japanese, or black that’s played
I want the crown
Like the homie Young Brown, Out Tha Gate
Watch me rock, roll, skate
Bouncin’, dancing with this little mama
Swing to the left, to the right, do the cha cha
We party all night long until the cops come
But since they didn’t come, mami, give me more run
I wanna get faded tonight because I’m on one
Don’t trip, your man’s at home, get ya freak on
Get ya hands up, shake that ass, don’t stop
You lookin’ bad for real, savvy mamacita
Out of all the women tonight, you’re a ten
I wanna experience your mind, body and soul, let it all begin

Repeat Chorus Four Times

[Verse 1]
Shut your face homeboy, yo it’s on
Quit your belly ache, your bitch and your moan
Hold your ground, hold your grudge hold your throne
It’s Arabesque and he’s officially blown
To all my headaches, I’m your Tylenol
Light years ahead of you ask the god
Thugs do the Debbie Gibson when they hear this
Backpackers pack there saddle on my penis
Best thing since sliced bread cut by Saukrates
Soul strut like Koreans with Bum Knees
Sy Wyld bring the beat like syameese
48 cali with those desert e’s
Commisso count my bread count my dough count my biscuit
I’m the mob’s official meal ticket
I’ll send your ass home and that’s an order
Like my pops with a 5 o’clock shadow at the border

[Chorus]
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
I ain’t goin no where
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Ayo Get use to me
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
Quit your Belly Achin’
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Motherfucker get used to me

[Verse 2]
Ya girl got them wanderin’ eyes, and you wonderin why
Motherfucker I’m one hell of a guy
9-5 on the nag 9-5 on the rag 9-5 make me gag
Venus is a full time job stay flappin’ they jaws
At Mars policies and laws
You like way I gassed you up
You fucking cocky cock
I’m Palestinian I was born to rock
It’s all real to a brotha you feel
Hold down the club like my name is steering wheel
Aramaic on the tongue big Besque on the chest
Those who want it we can put it to rest
To all the fakes make no mistake
This ain’t Degrassi High boy son, I don’t run with the snakes
Don’t get it twisted b
Ya mamma does dig me

[Chorus]
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
I ain’t goin no where
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Ayo Get use to me
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
Quit your Belly Achin’
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Motherfucker get used to me

[Verse 3]
Sand nigga sensation
If it ain’t Paula Abdul its Big Besque on your radio station
Ayo my people what’s the haps
It’s like good will handin’ out mics we catchin us a bum rap
My fam doesn’t own a 7-11
We hold down the bar with the southern and 7
For heaven sakes, been through all the pain and aches
Ayo son you know this wasn’t a quick break

[Chorus]
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
I ain’t goin no where
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Ayo Get use to me
Bellyache, wooooo that’s that bellyache
Quit your Belly Achin’
Bellyache, wooooo quit your bellyache
Motherfucker get used to me

This isn’t for the xenophobic, not domestic my sty-litto is foreign
If you’re conformist, I gotta warn you, this isn’t for you
If you aren’t up for exploring don’t you cross the boarder
I’ve got obsessive compulsive cross word puzzle disorder
My mind is troubled, my mind is muscle, don’t mind the muzzle
I thrive in the jungle, beware don’t let king Midas touch you
I’m above you, I’m even beneath you, I’m all around you
Uneven frequencies traveling in the speed of sound I’m
In your nightmares, see my reflection in the mirror
See my image standing in the back of your high school pictures
Like yellow stone national park I’m ready to explode
My soul’s the only one that can pull the sword out the stone
This isn’t another tired rap about Al Capone
And Al Paci\xc3\xb1o, Casinos, women and stacking dough
Witness the rising dough, the ovens gonna blow
The children wanna run, SO LET CHILDREN GO!!!

CHORUS
They don’t want you to know that I exist, flashbacks of 96
Because I remind you of what they want you to forget (x6)
Let my people go

Jump in the rabbit hole
It didn’t matter to Dorothy whether she was in Kansas anymore
Relax and let it go, just grab a hold of your kayak and let the rapids flow
Quit yapping about home already, and hand me the rope
You don’t have any hope-in, this battle its over
The chances are low that you’ll advance any further
I’ll savagely murder any track that I’m on
I’ll pivot my arm to swing the ax in my palm
I’m not telling you where, I planted the bomb
I’m not tell you how, I plan to disarm you
I’ll damage you all; I know I’m losing my mind
I’m sick and tired, of ticking time, standing in line
The entertainment industry is corrupt in design
If Pac and Big were still alive I think they would resign
You better cherish me now, because it won’t be long
Before I make a killing and suddenly end up gone

CHORUS
They don’t want you to know that I exist, flashbacks of 96
Because I remind you of what they want you to forget (x6)
Let my people go

Hey Mr. Dr. Dre, have you heard who I am?
Please take my One Sheet; it’s a pleasure shaking your hand
Feel free to forward my information to any man
Who’s willing to take a stand, take a risk or a chance
I don’t usually say any names but I been rhyming
All this time and my families still under the poverty line
I get props all the time but that just isn’t enough
The next show promoter that don’t pay up finna get snuffed
Sick of conducting business with undisciplined and twitted
Individuals who are narcissists and hedonistic
Who promise me there is no market for the realistic
Who prompt me to reconfigure the topics in my lyrics
Throw anything in my direction you can’t kill my spirit
Unstoppable Love is approaching, you will all be witness
The warrior who fights by the broken sword is relentless
I’m an Outlaw; only God can pass my sentence

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
In the town in that coupe
That youngling on a stoop
Soaked up the game
Epitome of the truth
I lead by example and do what
I’m supposed to
Count on me to always come through when the pressure’s on
Make no weapon form against them outlaws
We soldiers of God, against all odds
This the year of the underdog
Still I rise, I told you niggas
I will evolve
And there’s something more bigger
Something more powerful
More independent now
They gonna pay me by the minute now
Not just my blood
My soul invested in this thing
Failure’s never been an option
Get your paper, my nigga, we eating lobster
Young Noble and Gage Gully
Year of the underdog, real niggas ride with me

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It’s the year of the underdog
I’m rocking gym shorts and jays in this rap game
‘Cause I come to ball
Allergic to sleeping
Niggas serving and scheming
Yeah, I wonder y’all
A sketchy nigga because my gun a draw
Where I’m from little kids be shooting since laser tag
By the time they 20 they martyrs or someone’s baby’s dad
Cops wanna kill me ‘cause I’m darker than a paper bag
Parked the latest Jag by the police sergeant and made him mad
Who cares what my enemies think?
Long as I’m grinding till I’m literally bricks
Till Bernini is giving me Meeks
I’m hustling all night
On so much caffeine I’m literally pissing out energy drinks
And cruel love ain’t a small thing
That’s why I’m on that hokey team shit
Grinding till we all kings
And them hating niggas have the mean muggers
By screw facing our magazine covers
We on, nigga

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 3: Gage Gully]
I don’t sit in the house, projects
We be getting them out
I’m state to state
Cross country when they living in doubt
Can’t be afraid to travel
I’m a warrior, made to battle
I’ll take the stage
Tear that motherfucker down ‘cause I have you
I’m popular with the dealers
I probably could get you realer
Or possible order still
But tell your people we’ll bill you
Want it now, cash out
In the streets back routes
My movement that bow
More traffic than a crack house
More action over here
Getting dough so that counts
Getting drown, hustling days of the weak then pass out
When they was trying to freestyle
All I had was wee pows
I’m on the concrete blocks, and Gully a beast now
It’s cold, I’m leaning for no reason, looking to bleed towns
Soon as they catch on we taking the cream then bounce
My team found oh so much to leave you barely seeing how
Walking to queen mount, Gully, he chip a bean dream out

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Hook - 2x]
Oooh, you can catch me in the candy blue
Top down, and I’m banging Screw
Screens steady falling, 20 inches crawling
Boppers still calling, tell me what you wanna do

[Lil’ B]
Hit the block top down, chrome spin while the grill shine
I’m candy blue thought you knew, trunk popped up saying peek-a-boo
Take a look at you peeping B, 12’s kicking ass like Bruce Lee
Maybe Jet Li doing kung-fu, if I think you jacking better run fool
What I’m gon do is hog the scene, cause hoes know my hog is clean
It was all a dream to be stacking green, now I’m shining trying to have finer things
Now they calling me bopping hoes, just because I’m on stop-and-go’s
Clocking do’ rocking shows, still dripping candy blue out my do’s

[Jay’Ton]
Southwest what I’ma represent, when I’m sitting low behind five percent
In a fo’ do’ Crentley slow, see the drop I’ll take your hoe
Just like that I’ma beat the back, off the Lac till the frame crack
It’s Jay’Ton Trae in the back, with a black Mack that’ll make you scat
22’s blocking off the lane, with Lil’ Boss repping Hoover gang
We Slow Loud can’t forget the Bang, I’m 17 in the game mayn
Candy blue popped out the roof, plenty diamonds all on my tooth
Buy the mall cause I got the loot, representing for the DJ Screw

[Hook - 2x]

[Billy Cook]
I’ma stay on my note, and I’m stay on my grind
I’ma grip grain, bang Screw all the time
I’m known for spitting game, and riding reckless on the freeway
Slow Loud And Bangin’, I’m gon rep the G way
Billy Cook Superstar, and you niggaz know the name
Catch me rolling with my click, and banging in a wide frame
Crawling so slow, screens on glow
Body rocking a slab, in a blue fo’ do’

[Trae]
Niggaz hating I’ma sit and chill, gangsta lean when I glide the wheel
I’ma run the block like I run the field, Impala no more houpe DeVille
Maybe SUV, representing for the S.U.C
R.I.P. to Fat P-A-T, tell the law to let Z-Ro free stop it G
Nigga never, you see me you’ll see the leather
Never broke cause I’m getting cheddar, my paint wetter than the rainy weather
When the sun beaming I’m looking good, representing for the Southern hoods
When the top drop it’s understood I wreck, you niggaz wish you could huh

[Hook - 2x]

[Pimp Skinny]
Hit the block when I’m pulling out, beating your back riding by your house
I’ma hit the top if your bitch bop, I’ma beat the cot like a Tyson shot
That’s a body blow just letting you know, been pimping since ‘74
That’s the way it go squatting low, pop the trunks then let it go
Some call me Skinny call me Pimp, three wheeling slab catch a limp
Then I snatch a hoe when I slam the do’, 24’s and low pro’s
Friends or foes gotta watch em, try to jack I gotta glock em
That’s the way it is I’ll split your wig, with the candy blue all across my shit

[Boss]
Stacking cash when I’m in the street, starched down strapped to my feet
Never leave the house without the heat, pulling up to let the trunk beat
Coupe DeVille with the bumper grill, Southsi’ for li’ with a wooden wheel
You don’t want the drama it’s best to chill, po’d up a pint and took off the seal
I’m playa mayn, never catch me up in the turning lane
While you all standing be burning mayn, looking at all the money we earning mayn
Fondren and Main I’m swerving lanes, BJ steady perving in a ‘burbon mayn
Throwback Julius Erving mayn, pulling up in all of the finer thangs

[Hook - 2x]

Siah: 98, S-I, what
Yeshua Da PoED, check it

Siah:
Riding the beat
beats walking on the street
I can hop a train
and move in that vehicle
but the metaphor is better for traveling quick
to any destination and any location
in the known universe of my imagination
confined in a verse
I’m a powerful combine
who got to bomb minds like a war flick
on time when my jaw spit raw shit
hella fit,halibut,had to fit
grab a chalice to sip, then slip
through the sands of my ‘cholosis(?)
S-I not the V
I’m in the place to be
still swinging on vines in the tree
I don’t want to be distraught, more overjoyed
rather be caught in a void, nullify
What if I delve a blade
I left my sickle at the airport cuz I felt sick
Whether you felt it or not
I don’t give a shit
But if you leave it on the shelf then it might get spoiled
Take it to health, Lord knows I toil
now unemployed, never employed as a decoy
unless it’s so
Yeshua Da PoEd can blow the spot, blow the spot (fade)...

Yeshua:
Now all cats who ain’t prepared, beware
all I need is the pair of kicks,a snare and his dare
for the taking
hall with my statements, to hell with all the waiting
sort of breaking a spell
you can tell
what I’m making is fail safe
Laced at a pace to digest
cuz all the tracks I bless got me rhyming slow
and I’m in no
hurry, worry, my flow was to fat to wrap
I plan to drop pounds
I came to explain hip-hop sounds
simple and plain (simple and plain)
If you’re not down, yo man
get down with the program
or at least the flow release Yeshua Da PoED
from the east coast, don’t mean to boast
but an MC like me is what the world needs most

Chorus:
S: From night til morn
Y: Dusk til dawn
S: Yo, injected with life
Y: Cuz we must live long
S: Traditions that I strive to carry on
Y: Get cut on a plate and end up in your crate
(repeat)

Siah:
Not feeling precise, I got a healin’ device
It’s called a walk-man, on track
bettin’ that I get back home around midnight
caught up in mid-flight
my dim light, did like, hit me with insight
When all is the same, and I remain content
not a need to repent, let it out like a vent
What I meant is a youth parism(?)
self in my self is the proof
but no convoluted truth
Just a simple rebuke
got me sittin’ in this composition
on a mission to find revenue
I never knew that it was necessary
Reality can get scary, but I
parry and thrust with the best of us(sets of us)
nuts and chops(?)
I knock minds with rhymes
and the cuts that I drop can stop time on a dime
If I was truly wise, then I would shut the fuck up
Still waitin’ impatient for life to catch up

Yeshua:
It took more than the luck of the draw
to put my foot up in the door
It coulda been cause and effect
Styles I studied before, often reflect
Too bad the cats that taught it the best, got caught in the net
Now I’m in effect
You see, I quit my job to become full-time MC
When I’m full, rhymes empty, till I reload
skills I will stow
in the form of flow
till ya know
the D to the A to the Po-E-D
When I spray, ya gonna belive me
I rep the Wee Bee
Foolish to truest form, no matter what track
I do this on
Crews get on, guess who get dropped
(Guru sample) "Cuz they have no regard, for real hip hop"
I don’t stop,yeah yeah
I don’t don’t quit
Yeshua Da PoED guaranteed to be the ultimate
(Like that)

Chorus

Like that
Unsung heroes
Si and Yeshua

(*talking*) 
Grrrrrrr...turn the track up, turn the mic up 
Yeah, what you bout to witness it’s the Vault baby 
Do it now nigga come on, do it now nigga 

[Chorus - 2x] 
We gives you, exactly what you want 
And exactly what you need, all you gotta do is thug when we 

[Magic] 
I pop bottles, and I fuck models 
And the way I dress, you’d think I done hit the lotto 
So I keeps a magazine, filled up with hollows 
And don’t date a bitch, unless I heard mami swallowing 
I got a following 
A bunch of thug niggaz in the hood hollering, (9th Ward) 
I moves with power, I’ll have a flight of niggaz here within a hour 
To, bring out the coward 
In these so called gangsters, yank ya 
Up out your mama house and stank ya, uh-huh 
I put a nigga in a bad situation 
Bullets chasing ya, your heart’s racing 
Shell casings, falling to the concrete 
I really doubt it, if you hear another heartbeat 
I embrace the block, like I embrace a glock 
Off top, I’m in the hood screaming fuck a cop 
9th Ward nigga, get it right 
If you don’t get it right, me and my niggaz might fight tonight 
You ain’t ready for combat 
You talk real good, but me and my niggaz bout that 
M16’s with night beams 
You still carry pistols, and we strapped like the fucking Marines 
You know my background, you know my area 
So don’t question my character 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Trouble] 
Cherish my lyrics like the last supper, swallow them bones 
You burning up in weed smoke, follow you home 
Give me your love we hard, hustle for like we grind 
Thug niggaz, you can’t help but be in love with mine 
Given the limelight, sender to the broke and blind 
Lost and found niggaz, heaven ain’t that hard to find 
It’s destiny, here’s proof till the roof come off 
This where I get up in that ass, till the truth come out 
We stretch for loot stacks, so high it don’t spend 
Possessing what’s on the game, in time we don’t bend 
My kind genuine, rock and still it don’t bend 
Take a look what we got in the vault, you can’t win 
Drawing blood, till the sunshine 
Speak every line, like we only getting one rhyme 
Come for the crowd I got mo’ than just a point to prove, pay me in pain fool 
I ain’t got a thang to lose 
So bare witness to the cross till it’s lost behind, get unattached 
We strong arm first in line, send up a prayer for me 
Money make the world go round, turn up the mic for me 
Trouble make the world slow down... 

(*talking*) 
Trouble, don’t go nowhere shaggy 
I don’t think they heard ya, talk that shit to em ya heard

[Master P]
Picture this, any man that hustle because like to is a fool.
Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
that’s a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil’ brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto’s got me hustlin’ tryin’ to survive
the ghetts got me hustlin’ tryin’ to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin’ tryin’ to survive,
and I know I’m goin’ to hustle until the day I die.

[Master P]
UUGGHH!!!
It’s da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
see that’s the way I felt when my lil’ brother died.
And some fools say it ain’t no justice 
and other niggaz say it ain’t no peace
that’s why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
and my cousin made me killer.
See that’s why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I’m still tryin’ to understand why big daddy was with da rest
and my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain’t muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
and I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
and live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin’ 25 flat
on murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can’t fight that.
And since I’m black and I’m rich 
they see to overlook It’s me advise
first class niggaz tryin’ call da police tryin’ to book us.
Ain’t that a bitch, I done made millions 
and still goin’ through a thang
That’s niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

[Silkk The Shocker]
It’s like I’m rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
it’s the world changes knowand changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn’t made it through
so with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
the ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien’ up in the hearse
thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be wrorst.
Ever feel like u was swimming, and really was dronin’
you ani’t wanna smile but your tender smile always see me clownin’
I trade my life to make the world better 
trade everything I got including life 
to bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
tryin’ make yo’ll feel this shit.
Yo’ll tryin’ put the finger on our side, 
livin’ middle bricks livin’ this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
but we had to ride buggies
mom wanted better things for me 
but private school was way past our budget.
So if I’m  happy and I’m smilin’ and I’m camouflage my problems
the only way I can really solve them 
if I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
what everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin’ no profits
my only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
but can’t really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
everybody tryin’ to maintain 
wall from out da ghetto, 
close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

[Chorus x2]

If you wanna test me, I’ma pass the quiz
Looking for a teammate, together we can win
Better treat me right, or I’ma trade you in
And you can get the deuces call me ex-girlfriend
Ok, just listen

Don’t try to play me like no fool, huh
Do your dirty and come around like it’s cool, huh
Forget it, you hoe niggas don’t get enough
I get it, but I ain’t the one for that bullshit, so...
I told myself never settle for less
And you ain’t got to give if you ain’t loving yourself
And I ain’t jumping head first cause you got a little money
The minute you think you need them that’s when shit get funny, now

I’m looking for a teammate, let’s play the game together
Down for whatever, make it through the stormy weather
I bring mine to the table, then the dinner plate
So don’t make a mistake, learn to appreciate

If you wanna test me, I’ma pass the quiz
Looking for a teammate, together we can win
Better treat me right, or I’ma trade you in
And you can get the deuces call me ex-girlfriend [x2]

Ok, peace, holler, I’m gone, I’m way too strong
You been too wrong, with you I do not belong
So carry on, I will not be stepped on

So move along, now this right here, my theme song
How can we grow, with no trust?
I’m down to compromise, but damn, not too much
You want to make it right, well nigga, man up!
No time to back track baby gonna step up
Guys all in my face, but I don’t want nothing but you
I see the good in you baby, can you be true?
Don’t get me wrong, every couple got they issues
Stop messing up, or it’s on to the next dude, I’m gone

If you wanna test me, I’ma pass the quiz
Looking for a teammate, together we can win
Better treat me right, or I’ma trade you in
And you can get the deuces call me ex-girlfriend

You want to make it right, go and man up
You want to make it right, go and man up
Don’t back trap baby, gonna step up
You want to make it right, go and man up
You want to make it right, go and man up
You want to make it right, go and man up
You want to make it right, go and man up
Don’t back trap baby, gonna step up

If you wanna test me, I’ma pass the quiz
Looking for a teammate, together we can win
Better treat me right, or I’ma trade you in
And you can get the deuces call me ex-girlfriend [x2]

   
   As the last breath triggers the last beat
   I look to the sky to drown the devilish heat
   I feel it closin’, they’re gettin’ higher and higher
   Each foul flame from the same hellfire
   Only moments passed since I existed
   Perhaps I acted rash, I should have done what they insisted
   I resisted, twisted thoughts ran wild
   I was too mad to be mild, I was too rough to be riled
   But now it’s done, I probably won’t be missed by anyone
   Although I had my fun I’m still on the run
   Where am I goin’? It’s no good not knowin’
   Should be glad that I’m gone because my yellow streak’s showin’
   Thinkin’ have I done much wrong for me to perish
   Or will I have another day for me to cherish
   I have to bargain, see my soul’s on the line
   So I’ll settle for nothin’ lesser than the Great Divine
   
   Verse 2
   
   Friends worked hard to try and save me, why? They didn’t know
   If I was them I would’ve left me long ago
   It’s over, thoughts are trained towards the hereafter
   I look for The Saviour but then I hear laughter
   If I’m to make it through the Pearly Gates
   I have to devise a plan and get my story straight
   It ain’t too late to save my soul, I never lost a scheme
   I’ll talk to God and make him melt like an ice cream
   It seems this waiting is for reflection
   Then when it’s done I’ll go whatever direction I deserve
   But listen, I’ll deserve my place there
   Ok, I’m scared, but I don’t easily scare
   I’ll walk up, knock on the door like I’m the gentry
   Plead from my knee and they’ll proceed to give me entry
   I reflect on all the stealin’, the dealin’, the dissin’
   Hopin’ somewhere up in heaven that my file went missin’
   
   Verse 3
   
   I used to be a big man, like kings respected
   I carried out the sort of things expected of me
   And my posse, bred to be bossy
   Didn’t yield to command you felt the back of my hand, understand?
   I did dope, sold to kids who were thrilled by it
   I was responsible for many who were killed by it
   I didn’t realise then, but now I know
   I didn’t realise then, but even so
   I stole to deprive, scold those who patronised
   Fought for my turf, it was worth it in my eyes
   Cheated, repeated all this day by day
   Until the medic picked me up from where I lay
   Bleeding, but not conceding to the battle
   The darkness teased an unease, light bleeds staccato
   That’s when I knew I had to try it
   Prepare a prayer and pray he’d buy it
   Convince him, rinse him of my dirty past
   Rotten or right I must fight to the last
   Before the hands that pulled me down held tight
   I will repent before the love of life
   Fear cries, I’m drowned and bound to miss
   Valhalla, my seat in celestial bliss
   Infernal heat just like a creature creepin’
   Eternal sleep will be a lonely sleepin’
   
   Verse 4
   
   Father friend me, defend me
   Lend me your faith so that my fate don’t send me
   Down to the gates of Hell
   I did enough time inside a prison cell
   So take me, don’t forsake me
   Shape me from here so that my fear don’t break me
   Keep me from the terror that lies
   Beneath your kingdom, beneath the skies...
   
   Did he buy that? Well did he hear my prayer?
   I gave praise, I’m amazed he’s still up there
   He’s probably sendin’ down a heavenly host
   He’s just too busy to be leavin’ his post
   So I wait for a while but the Devil’s still posin’
   I wave goodbye while the gates are closin’ behind me
   You’ll never bind me or enslave me
   Hurry up heaven, come down and save me.

[Terrace Martin]
Tuh, it’s big T.M. leaning off the Seagreens
Eyes bloodshot, look at ‘em and you’ll see him
Now who we’ve become but his mother’s son?
The same one who avoided guns and picked up the drums
Had you marching to a different beat, stood you on your feet
I looked out, helped you off the streets
I gave you advice to heed, a new life to lead
In return, you took my kindness for weak
When I was at my lowest, truest colors started showing
Niggas I called friends wasn’t answering they phone then
Cuh, that’s when Quik’ words rang true
Be careful who you hand your celebrity to
Uh, didn’t get it till that very instant
Since then, between me and them I put a little distance
Niggas so lame for saying bro, it’s a shame
Disloyal like a hoe, sold you soul for this game
and you still broke nigga

[Chorus: Neka Brown]
Sometimes people go as quick as they come
They say that there’s nothing new under the sun
Cause time reveals all the reasons
Things change in life, just like seasons

[Kendrick Lamar]
Little Kendrick from the Hub
Can show you that my motive’s always been to give you love
I’m putting out good music in return to build a buzz
that’s bigger than life itself, or some bubble kush plug
Won’t you look the mirror? You see a pair of eyes that’s quite similar to mines
and if you do that shit should scare ya
Baby brother of Compton tryna the accomplish the impossible
with obstacles at my daily grinding, ohh no
Here come the critics, but not from the magazines, I mean
the blocks that be so-called mad at me, they’re mean
As soon as success is in my favor
They’ll try to break down my character, like I ain’t from their heritage
Quite frankly, it’ll hurt my soul to hear a nigga that I know
talking bad and tryna play me
Like we ain’t had pellet gun fights, falling off of minibikes
In a Buick bumping Clipse with no AC, why would you shame me?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Terrace Martin]
Yeah, mm, so I was driving home last night on the 1-0-1 freeway
and I look up, and there’s a sign that says ‘Love your friends and love your family’
And I thought to myself, why do we use these words so loose?
Love, friends and family
I mean, if love is involved, why do friends and family hurt us?
And why do we hurt them?
It’s kind of like we all forgot the true definition of love to begin with
Tuh, the one thing I do know, I nor you can be accountable for what somebody else does to us
We can only be accountable for what we do to them
So instead of saying that’s my friend, that’s my family, and it’s love
Huh, I’ma say this to y’all

[Neka Brown]
So many words we say ain’t really
What are we really saying?
People never change
Truth will be the same

Sittin in my Lazy Boy watchin MTV
Just my lady, my partner, his lady and me
Sippin Dom Perrignon, don’t answer the phone
I got servants to do it, cause I’m king of the throne
Rap titles I take, MC’s I shake
Never play when I’m ryhmin, there’s too much at stake
You think I would give all of this stuff up
You’re a crazy, lazy, daisy duck (?as I pluck?)
So don’t ever mess with us or you might not live
Especially when we’re coolin in the crib

We’re coolin
Coolin in the crib
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

Lots of people go to clubs, chill around the way
But the crib is the place that I like to stay
I got a microwave oven, big screen TV
Steam room, sauna bath, water b-e-d
A wall full of medals from the battles I’ve won
And a golden microphone shinin bright as the sun
Cordless telephone, answering machine
With the pre-recorded rhyme that sounds real mean
Says "I’m sorry, but the White Boys aren’t in
Leave a message at the tone or call again
And if you really wanna see us come where we live
You’ll find us coolin in the crib"

We’re coolin
Coolin in the crib
(Mr. Ed)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

Now in my crib I got my own studio
I keep it cool like me around 10 below
Because we work out there with a beat and a mic
Precise and Exact, kickin lines all night
When a friend comes to the crib to cool out
I look at my partner, he begins to shout
Put on your Swatch watch and your Converse shoes
And show the homeboys what you can do

Well, I can (1)
I can (2)
I can (3)
I can (4)
I can bust a def rhyme time after time
If rap was a mountain, you wouldn’t need to climb
You see me and Precise got a rhyme that can’t miss
And if you don’t believe that, ahaha, bust this
M.J. Precise rockin twice as nice
Always pay the price when he rolls the dice
All the time gettin paid, savin money that we made
Seven days a week always get laid
( ? ) friends, ( ? ) fools, fly fresh females
I’m super, sly, sexy, sharp as a nail
So if you see somebody don’t tell what we did
Just tell em to come and cool in the crib

We’re coolin
Coolin in the crib
(White Boys)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib

( *scratching of* )
(Coolin in the crib)

We’re coolin
Coolin in the crib
(Yeah)
Just coolin
Coolin in the crib
(What we doin now)
We’re coolin
(Oh yeah)
Coolin in the crib
(Everybody now)
We’re coolin
Coolin in the crib

[Verse 1]
Let’s go!
See it’s Webby
The dude who fucked your girl last Summer
And I ain’t even asked for her number, bummer
And I ain’t even smash with a rubber
So if your kid look like me
Don’t even ask motherfucker
Huh, you could be just like Web’
With a bottle in your hand
And a blunt to the head
Adderall (check!), shit I got my meds
But I think the doctor gave me something else instead
See I’m back again
What’s happenin’
Real life Billy Madison
And you know that I be rollin’
Life of a rockstar
Until I see those fucking lights on the cop car
When I hit it (Woop Woop!) we out
Time to dip, bring a chick to my parent’s house
Hit it on the tempurpedic from the back, right there
‘Till I hear (Chris) Mom stay the fuck downstairs!

[Chorus]
So put your hands up, and do like me
Fill your cups up, and roll that weed
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
So put your hands up, and do like me
Wash those pills down, and feel that beat
Tat your skin up, and sag those jeans
You could be just like me

[Verse 2]
See it’s Webby
The dude who.. ah shit, that was last verse
I’m so high that I’m reading shit backwards
Jedi Master, life of a bachelor
Your girl’s like salt (Why?) all up on this cracker
Walk around dizzy, with a cup full of whiskey
The next shot of Jack in front of me looking risky
Think about it quick, then I drink it more quickly
Cause fuck, everybody in the club getting tipsy!
From the booth to the track, I am here
At your frat with a beer, unlatching brassieres (uh)
And I’m feeling like I’ll never go to sleep
With all this shit that’s in my system
I’ll be up for a week
So it’s time to party like I do (I do)
Because it’s all I know, I don’t even try to (try to)
‘Till I’m forty-five thinkin how the time flew (time flew)
With a cup of vodka and some ice cubes
Telling them to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We smoking
And we be drinking
And we be fucking
All like its nothing
That’s all I know
Party, until we black out
And then we pass out
Then wake up like
Fucking let’s do it again!
So everybody just

[Chorus]

Hey yo! Right
Struggle da Preacher, Yukmouth

[Verse 1: Struggle da Preacher]
I am ready for big goals, expose my music
Yukmouth, big bro. No doubt I got it
Motherfuckers you know who’s coming
And when you ready for whatever to be better than anyone else in this game
All you get is pain in your ass, im the stress
I’m a killer, here is Godzilla
I am white, Russian born
I’m exploding like a nuclear bomb
Everybody on the block gonna know your name
But they talk about me all across the planet
I’m already known in London
Washington, every small town
I’ma bringing it back the real sound
Struggle da Preacher, uh, and Yukmouth

[Chorus: Struggle da Preacher]
What you gonna fight for?
If the game is dead, they don’t wanna hear you
But you gotta fight for
You gotta fight for your name, fight until you kill them

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
What it do nigga?
Stuggle da Preacher, what’s happenin’ boy?
Yuk! Look! ‘Zilla
Catch me rockin with the chop-suey
I get skewy with the K, hundred shot through him (brrreeh!)
Let my shooters run the block through him
Put that Ruger in his mouth, let it talk to him (bang)
Dragon gang in this thang, bitch
Slide up on your range, knock’em down with the stainless
Leave’em brainless, fuckin with the world’s most dangerous
Yuk and preacher, foreign exchanges
The AK-Russian, the 44 German (oooh weee!)
Italian leather, the rug’s all Persian (fuck boy!)
Sellin birds, I gotta urge for splurging
Come show with my dough, that nigga gon need a surgeon
Fo sure, nigga, no debate
I got hoes to break, hella dough to make
I can see why you soldiers hate
Fuck around and get smoked
Cuz I’m a warrior, like Golden State
Zilla

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

\t"I will abolish, wax and polish
\t MC’s in the place I will demolish"

Aiight, it’s how it’s going down in the 9 square
Brooklyn Studio, East New York representing
It’s like this y’all, check it

Aiight, I’m walking down the street, I got my 50 niggas deep
Crew jeeps too, ain’t nobody sleeping through the night
They can’t keep you in the crib, even your moms can’t keep you inside
I got the fat forward drive, live system in the back
Door be open and the chicks, they be scoping
My valuables, my gear, and my jewels
But as a rule I keep the tool on my side for my protection
So approach cautiously when you slide in my direction
I’m from Bucktown the four can make you up don’t give a fuck town
Bucks down, roll the dice twice if you’re nice
I’m soft spoken, but I do not be joking on my skits
So don’t make me get abusive on this shit
Come into the land of a man uncensored, I’m a predator
Since I murdered my editor, go on my nerves, I deaded her
I shot the sherrif, blew the head clean off the neck
On the shoudlers, I told a nigga give me my respect
And I don’t care if the deputies come looking for me
I’ll be in the East, set foot in the belly of the beast
And be deceased

\t"I will abolish, wax and polish
\t MC’s in the place I will demolish" Scars and Pain! (Repeat 2x)

If you know me then you know I’m low key intelligent
But I’m lethal, with sensitivity for my people
But every now and then I feel that old wild speak from the streets
Of the East and the beast is unleashed
I’m unchained like the massive migrane on my brain
With the sprain it’s strange, to endure but it’s raw
And it’s pure I got to get it off my chest to alleviate the stress
Press upon you like I did as a kid
In the days of the age and yes begin to cease
Out of the cess on the train, roll up the cessamellia
I be rocking it while the chocolate thai be running through my head
I see visions of laughs spread all around me
I feel a jones coming down like that little cutie from the Fugees
Coming through me, baby dew me I ain’t new to this
My pops took his microphone and made a megaphone
Out of my mom’s uterus I was born true to this
I’ll be doing this til I can’t do this no more
I’ll look an MC in his eye and ask him why he wanna die
Yep with laughter, I whip up MC’s into the hereafter
With a smile I greet ‘em and treat ‘em like a bastard child

\t"I will abolish, wax and polish
\t MC’s in the place I will demolish" Scars and Pain! (Repeat 4x)

Oh my God it’s a shame how I come down the lane like an express A train
Giving you Scars and Pain
I’m rough enough to call you on your Billy Goat’s bluff
I’m tough, and to ??? and kick up more than dust, I kick that ass
Up and down the street and nigga you don’t want
To meet in a dark alley in Chicago, New York, or Cali
I never dilly on my dally when I rally with my boys
I crush, destroy you’re whole gone, boy
My Desert Eagle ain’t illegal it’s legitimate
So I might just put you in the sites and take the hint
If the price is right I roll the enemies to extremes
I’m a fiend for the cash like the Old Dirty Bast getting cream
You wanna get with this as much as you will want to get with
Simple sins, upon my gonnorhea for weak MC’s
Weak imitator, real live, MC impersonator
Can’t withstand the wrath of my bloodbath
I crush, bumrush, and turn stone to know this ain’t no game
I royal flush you down the drain
Scars and Pain! With the beat sent to these MC’s like a sattelite
>From the new New York #1 Public Enemy

\t"I will abolish, wax and polish
\t MC’s in the place I will demolish" Scars and Pain! (Repeat 4x)

[Chorus]
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin for a 3-0-4
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin through your area code

[Javi Picasso]
My genie in a bottle, don’t wanna see me no jato
Off some weed and solcado, I’m a mollow ass mexicano
Thug solda, need a bad bitch that’d roll my doja
Got so many hoes if the po’ found out, he’ll make me a mormon Jahova
Tell your hoe to bend over, imagine that 
I’ma show her where the real thug passion at
Give her extacy, I’ll be bashin that
I wanna know where them bad ass bitches is at
Cash, money and cars, sex under the stars
With a supermodel chick in my arms
Marita, in a tight fa-vita
Yeah Javi wanna meet ya

[Merciless]
Merciless need a nasty hoe, a nasty bitch
Type of chick that won’t ask me shit
She like, ai-chi-wa-wa, ooh-la-la
She riding her girl for m\xc3\xa9nage tois
See, they pop pills while I smoke the dub
Sweet bang thug love in the middle of a club
After that, I’m still looking for mo’
I need a bitch, I need a hoe, I need a 3-0-4

[Chorus]

[Merciless]
Girl, squeeze your titties and scream my name
What you don’t know, game recognize game
Rubbing on my tattoos, and freed my love
You fucking with a loced out, crazy thug
Can’t fight the feeling on extacy
That’s why the Mac God keep blessing me
Now I’m down south getting crunk at shows
Might be from Cali, but she got so throwed
I need a bad bitch that’s down tonight
No plummer, but I do lay pipe
No biter, but can I have a bite
Shit, in other words I’ll fuck you right
I’ll serve you long dick, big brown dick
Type of chick that you could get down wit
A white bitch, brown bitch, you a black bitch
I don’t care, long as she a bad bitch

[Chorus]

[Rasheed]
I’ma pull up in a all black Range
Purple flame, watch the paint change
Foud two looking strange, and got in the Range
I put a bullet in your brain, when I’m moving the caine
Man, your chick is on my nuts
I don’t got time, put on the cuffs
Put the tongue on my nuts, put the thong in her butt
Bust alarm got the guts, I was gone had to raise up
Break up to the make up, fuck that 
When I wake up, got a cock I got to bake up
Raise it up, while I blaze it up
The funky stuff, from the caddy pick-up, yup
She wanna live lavishly, thinking that she having me 
She can define the laws of gravity
I’m gonna bust one deep in a cavity

[Low-G]
Mamacita sabes que en tringo
Mo’ viento, pata to a quethro
From tu querida, me wanna to a quera
Forgive me amore, but es be my beta
Madi madi sabes get the quero
Forgive me amore, but es see the cero
Soy tures thinking of the dinero
Soy tures thinking of the dinero
El mero mero porno
Cilo como en the cheddo
I need a fine freak, who can roll my cigarello
Yo got a mello, sucking dick up, by the bello
Blue in lorego, en camente como en prego

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Where the drum roll, numskull
Aint you seen the white horse, aint you seen the gun smoke
Funds low these bums broke, chatting with Colombo
Peeling back the moon roof, and now my skin is sun soaked
Aint no rocket science, but I need space
Aint been to compliant, mama saying that I need faith
Being self-reliant we just ash when they cremate
Go ahead and pick a star, which one would you replace
Balls full of gas, they don’t even need names
Earth’s about the cash, working on a pre-paid
Flame to the glass, inhale and then relieve pain
Life a lot of things, she aint never been no cheap date
Slave in a free state, discovering the cub bards dry
Listen to the engine putter brother give another try
Pop mutters, baby sucking on her mother’s for another night
Gunfire is another lullaby

[Verse 2]
And from the end is where this poem starts
No regards, watering the rose and still we grow apart
Hopeless hearts, anxious dip your toes with sharks
I’m floating in the ocean on top of shards of Noah’s Ark
Ride the wave cautious, and then I set sail
Arrived on dry land, walking, on an egg shell
With lead bells, blowing the whistle man I just left hell
Nothing to regret well except maybe that death smell
Behind the red veil enjoying the best seats
The rest grieve, nothing to show for it but prestige
Wonder what success brings, I go against the jet stream
Knowing one man’s night mare is another’s wet dream

[O’Ryan Verse]
I felt like I was in Saudi Arabia
It was candles and pillows everywhere
She pushed me on the bed den climbed on top of me
Took her glasses off den let down her hair
(damn baby)

[chorus]
in her bedroom I’m about to break her off
I’m about to make her scream
tonight shes gonna do things
that shes never done
in my bedroom boy bottoms up
in my bedroom boy bottoms up
in my bedroom boy what what
you kno what dis is boy bottoms up

[Romes 1st Verse]
girl I aint mad at the fact you kidnapped me
and I cant put up a fight cuz dis is where I wanna be
girl you takin off my throwback playin wit my dew rag
let me keep my timbs on shawty while I’m stroking
I kno ya momma sleepin
And ya lil brotha got love for a nigga and he kno we sneakin
Yo bedroom is sentuous when you wanna get adventurous
Baby so spontaneous got me high like angel dust
Yo sheets got us tangled up
You like it rough when it feel like you mangled up
You kno backshots my favorite angle what
Yo booty wiggle like a bowl of jelly
Got me hard as metal I’m beyond yo level
Cool and melo cova ya bed wit rose pedals
Bottoms up I’m rich but so ghetto
And imam curl yo toes up and make sure you had yo nose up
Now you in love aint conceited no mo
Imam break you off but you aint getting no dough yo

[chorus]

[Romes 2nd verse]
girl I kno I got you tinglin
why you think they call me jangalang
king ding-a-ling
more precious den rings and things
I’m hard but you make sing momi
tiem spent like a time aid
I got game girl I kno you want me
On me like white on rice platinum on ice
Stop stutterin set yo price
ow!

[repeat chorus till end]

We’re about to get WHITE BOY WASTED
Your Favorite Martian and Dumbfoundead
Getting crunk up in here!
We’re about to get
WHITE BOY WASTED

We stumble to the house party already buzzed
We get retarded when we start drinking Bacardi because
Getting wasted in the basement is our only obligation
Plus we don’t know the meaning of the word moderation

I’m, I’m crude when I talk
Shirt off, fist fighting every dude on the block
And then I’m hugging you
Like I ain’t gonna see you again
Like dude I freaking love you man!
Imma drunk dial my ex-girlfriend
But first I have to pass out and yack
In the downstairs bathroom
So raise your red cups up and make noise
Cause we drink like
Upper middle class teenage boys

Oh it’s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it’s time to party
It’s time to party

White boy, White, White boy wasted [x6]

White boy wasted

Yo, last night I partied up at a frat house
It was full of college kids
Singing along to Smash Mouth
Half of them passed out
A fat dude with his ass out
Looking like John Belushi
In the movie Animal House
All of a sudden somebody yelled out
Keg stand
Tow jocks with tube socks and sweatbands
They pointed at me
And carried me by my legs man
I had to do it
It probably wasn’t the best plan
Next thing you know
It’s a beer pong and takin Jager shots
Now I’m in the corner and
Throwing up morning tater tots
Pissin on police cars
Yelling out I hate the cops
White boy with dreadlocks
Now give me major props

Oh it’s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it’s time to party
It’s time to party

White boy, White, White boy wasted [x8]

Oh it’s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it’s time to party
party

All I want to do
All I want to do is just get
White boy wasted

Oh it’s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it’s time to party
It’s time to party

[Intro]
To the beat y’all.. to the beat y’all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch" - Notorious B.I.G.

[Verse One]
See I done chalked up another one when I drop a ton
Take yo’ favorite MC and bring the light like the sun
Get done! Bow down I be the one known to rock rhymes
with lines beyond yours to make it prime time
I’m the master, of the ceremony Mally G
It’ll be a long day before you see another me
I be, higher than clouds, with the system pumpin loud
trippin lovin life, it’s the illest juvenile
wit my nigga Red, runnin up in
your spot wit enough dick for you and a friend
Some killer ass weed, for those who huff
It make you wanna kill a nigga after takin one puff of the stuff
Shit is tough, but all stress
chased away by the Tanqueray murder in my way
+Heyyy, Young World+, peep my method of madness
Watch it bring sadness because it’s that thorough
It’s me against the world

[Chorus One: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"

[Verse Two]
I gets mad wreck when wreck is the concept
Stickin tecs to fake niggaz necks when they flex
For those that don’t know about my flows let me introduce
I’m anti truce plus pack a deuce deuce
I’m 5 feet 5 inches, I serve the best of the lyricsts
I come swift, Def Squad soloist
I be one of the illest, realest, gettin busy shorties
Rollin wit Reggie smokin blunts and drinkin 40’s
I’m rippin niggaz out the frame with information
when I unleash shit I dust em off like creation
If it’s on it’s on nigga (say word bond)
Word bond on my momma and his, and his kids!
I represent the Rast where niggaz ill, fuck peace!
All the shit you talkin nigga that will get yo’ ass deceased
Murder; haven’t you heard of what I be droppin?
Cause when I drop my ill style my style be poppin
like corn, word is bond, it’s on again
I wet ‘em up till them fess up, with the mac to they chiin
It’s the black Mac 10 I never rome with chrome
When I do my ill shit I only represent my home
It’s P-H-I double the L, Y
When I’m in New Jersey, North 18th, hittin up Double I
Now sigh in relief cause y’all can’t see me
I be the looniest little ass MC, now
when I drop my format I mak yo brains go splat
from what I pack niggaz gots to react

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck" - B.I.G.

[Verse Three]
Comin from the Squad of Def, never left stranded
All is demanded when the glock nine is handed
Demanded when Green Eye, pack heat
Still keepin it real, maintain to keep it street
Peep, the way I sweep MC’s up off they feet
Irritatin like whack rhymes on funk beats
Your shit is obsolete, I speak, and crush when I bust
upon niggaz with the gun like track meets to make em run
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
And when I rock that shot, MC’s is sure to fall
You shouldn’t have went there, nigga
You gotta come quicker and slicker I’m known to twist a Mr.
Now is you wit me? (With who?) Jamal
Got the girlies hangin from the balls ‘til I dick up in they drawers
I got shit covered like plaster, comin massively
Back steps for more wreck and let bitches get passed to me

[Chorus Two]

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH!
Y’all already know what it is, this is fam
Yo, Brooklyn raise up (come on)
Uptown raise up, Queens
Staten Island, the Boogie Down

[Chorus: Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Aiyyo some people die for it (And some live it)
Some people snatch what they can (And some give it)
It’s not how you play the game (It’s how much you win)
Fuck the wages of sin, we gon’ hustle
(We don’t get by) We multiply
(We don’t settle for less) We take the whole pie
(Don’t gamble, we invest) Cause the stakes is high
(Whether we live or we die, we gon’ hustle)

[Talib Kweli]
You all comfy when shit is paid up, like the car note or your rent
Look out you broke, and now you got more Hustle than Larry Flynt
Diggin up dirt on politicians when you got no pot to piss in
Sellin watches for commission, with fake rocks that don’t glistin
Holdin up a block position, been a lot of options,
for you to get in, stop the bitchin!
You just ain’t makin no hot decisions - where the blood clot?
Look how many gold-diggers the clubs got
If you ain’t up on the hustle, find yourself doin the bus-stop,
or the train station, with the change, waitin for a metro card
Petrified, cuz once you get the dough to let go is hard
I’m a vet though and it’s odd to see these new cats splurgin
Industry virgins think money make ‘em a better person
Sign to ya mans label, which is under a label, under a parent label,
apparently you ain’t even able to sit down at the table
You ain’t braggin about seein the dough,
You braggin about bein a ho
Don’t be mad at me, be mad at’cha boys,
I just thought you needed to know

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they try to gas me up (gas me up)
But I don’t fall for the flattery
Just keep the people charged like assault with a battery
Now your mad at me, and your squad wanna battle me
Cuz every line I spit, got a money-back guarantee
With a lifetime warranty, just keep the receipt
Universe is passing moments, but my world is the street
They can’t dance and when they hustle, they trip over they feet
They tryna make ends meet like when they cipher complete
I used to wanna be a star when I was a spectator
So now I’m legendary, when I die I’ll be greater
It’s funny how life is just like an elevator
But major life changes ain’t nuttin to be afraid of
Remember (-member) nuttin in this life come free
Cuz if I take from you, somebody else gon’ take it from me
And I’ll be damned if I let somebody take it from me
Shit I’ma do for y’all the way you never did it for me
Come on

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Up in the city that never sleeps, black mommas forever weep,
and cats whip Jeeps equipped with fashion designer leather seats
But the team is never beat, and we always weather the heat
Stay with that mentality, I’ll bet y’all niggas never eat

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they callin me the Devil’s Advocate,
but they don’t know the half of it
The lone catalyst, shaped for my master shit
Make it tangible, firmin up the hand of these apes
Who can’t grasp because intense, so they rewindin my tapes
Yo Kweli!

[Talib Kweli]
We count down to armageddon like 1, 2, 3, 4
We raw like C4, been here before and after
You up and down like a see-saw,
With your fake hustle, that beats more
Like when I ask my three year old son to make muscles

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Cuz muscles come in all shapes, and mine take the form of breath
So when I spit the air is thick enough to beat you to death
See to die is to have lived, but you can’t even die right
You like a candle on the sun, nigga you just a waste of light

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Come on eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
(It’s like, it’s like, it’s like)
Come on, come on, come on (Uh, uh, uh, it’ like)
Yea yea yea yea yea yea (Yo, it’s like, uh)
Yea yea yea (Come on it’s like)
Raw Series, Mr. Man (Come on, it’s like)
(Yo, yo, it’s like)
Kweli, Reflect ‘Ternal
(Y’all wanna get a peice) C-Smith
Rawkus Records, Raw Series Entertainment
Make it nice like that for you..

QUESTION~!

[Chorus 2X: Greg Nice]
Who got the get high? Yo I’m from N.Y.
Yo I stay high, so I can get by
So I can get by, just so I can get by
So I can get by, just so I can get by

[Greg Nice]
I need that antidote, shit that make ya choke
And I don’t mean the coke, cause that shit’ll leave ya broke
I’m talkin ‘bout the schmoke, the mean Cabrini Green
The shit that make ya float, make you wanna do the lean
I got my mind open, my thoughts acceleratin
I got to get it now, the paper elevatin
The bills steady comin, the kids are steady growin
Got to get it now, you already knowin

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
My homey out of work, shit has gone berserk
Gotta save face, yo I try to keep a smirk
I pop a chill pill, I tell her get up off me
Then I get a tall cup of Duncan Donut coffee
I stay wired up, but off the legal high
Don’t need to tell y’all, y’all know the reason why
Life be off the chain, so hard to be explained
I bust that buddha bless, so I won’t go insane

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
It’s six o’clock now, my day been goin long
It’s happy hour baby gotta get our drink on
I want a margarita, for me and mamacita
She get her buzz on, start feelin I’ma beat her
I need another shot, first shot didn’t faze me
I need a shot so strong that it daze me
The boss stressin me, my girl pressin me
The Lord blessin me the devil keep testin me

[Chorus]

now everybody wants to be an MC
father don was in line when he told it to me
see yous a actor trying to rap, now I just can not adapt
so stay the fuck away me, no compadre man I’m strapped
cause fakers cant fuck with the real
I know you can not take this but you must and you will
so bust if you will, I bust to the grill
and make them major labels say I must get a deal
but anti-black is the label that im true to
busting tight raps aint nothing that im new to
nigga get used to listening to the dame
or throw it in your ass way wicked with the game
now I got you sitting there tripping off the shit that I said
you want to take my place and you wish I was dead
steadily pray for my downfall, but I remain a playa
I kicks it in the flats and smoke some dank with Tayla
and laugh like im watching def comedy jam
man you know how many niggaz out there running around
saying, oh imma be the man, but they aint shit aint even
got a hit nigga, why dont you check my list nigga
aint it hella dick nigga, at you bustas I got to aim
rip out your body frame, lyrically potty trained to
take you marks out the game, from product to product
I drop hits if I wants to, but if you got it you got it
but if you dont you dont dude

[Chorus]
If you got it, you got it, but if you dont you dont
some of us fall off, and some of us run
now how many MC’s must get dissed
before you niggaz see you cant fuck with this

[Verse 2]
pay attention to every word this is ruff
and im turbocharged like sir fishes truck
I told you nigga what but you done listen up
they blow you style dead as fuck nigga pick it up
shit is scary, lacking that little berry
take you ass to the wack rap cemetery
fuck it im a top dollar, and you’s a noodle
im busting like a rotwiller and you’s a poodle
simple simon subjects, raps with no substance
competition is none thats what im up against
loving this, cause niggaz thought I never would
productiveness and shit that sounds hella good
Dangerous Dame never stood at a stand still
man chill, I pack the house like an ant hill
cause sister’s she’s existing me
and its a mystery for you to try to get with me
so reminise on the words of the great like bird
from the trait state, perved everyday
but im focused on the come up
dont think im coming down cause I won’t
but if you got it you got it
but if you dont you dont

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
now let me O.G. this like Dr. J
so they get ? fast
drop your head and walk away
with your embarrassed ass
thats the way usually go
its just the same routine
rappers wanna use the flow, but I remain a king
swallow my face and bite my stai
you think a nigga dumb
EA-Ski and Rally Ral where did you get it from
no you aint the first to fight
the B-O double S always got me words to write
lets see who bubble next, niggaz know the whole school
you think they dont though, fool I control you
so get your own flow, I pound in this town
I will not flow to fake, now how would you sound if I stopped
dropping tapes, do you know? well you going to
do you like the styles that Dangerous Dame has been showing you
motherfucker I know you do, im over you, you think
of me when you see vocal boots, a local crew
oh no im just a soldier fool
im smoking boots just so you know the rules
dont try to felx up im just a true G
and when im dead you will still be trying to catch it to me

[Chorus in backround while Dame is talking to end]

[Chorus 2x: Snoop Dogg]
Down south smuggling cash, Hustlin for cash
Bustin my ass, Just to live 1st class
As the game rotate, I regulate to innovate
City to city, State to state, Don’t hate

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I get up early in the morning, I take a blunt to the head
Gets my kids out the bed
Jump out, Do what I have to

Snoop d-o-double-gizzie keep it busy, keep it dizzy
Keep these people guessin

Is this, When you in the mix of tryin to get yo chips
Seperate yo friends from yo bitch
Now this is this, This is this, And this that
Cause once upon a time the homies try to jack
They tried to creep on double g from the back
So I had to move down south, Is it right?, Is it like that?
Ain’t no need for me to tell y’all what the fuck popped off
Niggaz tryed to take my chips and then they got knocked off
Snoop dogg don’t be playin, I be sayin the real
I’m serious bout this paper dogg, And I might get killed
If I keep it too real, Let me spill my guts, Over this track
To let you niggaz know how I act
I get the chedder, Keep it better
Keep my sweater on close
Just in case these niggaz take a trip out the coast
And try to catch me slippin, I ain’t slippin no more
Let me smoke this indo and then I count my dizzough
And when I hit the shtizzo, Or better yet the schizzo
You can gaurantee, I’m gauranteed to show

Chorus 2x

[AMG]
With the mad funk..

[Chorus]
AMG, on the go
Back on the motherfuckin microphone
It’s the pimp of the century
So bitch pour the Hennessey!

[AMG]
(Aowwww) I got a new bone to pick
and hoes, I got a big bone to lick
And niggaz been ridin my dick, like an Amtrak
Niggaz thought I fell the fuck off, but the G’s back
The dog from around the way
Uhh (L.A., Cal-i-for-ni-a)
And baby I bust ‘em in
Hoodrats hoes can’t even just ride the dick
And niggaz been houndin me
I’ll be out, they surroundin me
but never is they clownin me
And this ain’t "Bangin on Wax"
But let me get straight to the facts
I ain’t no blood or crip
but I got a glock 23 with a couple of clips
And gold diggin hoes get the 22
(Buzzin) buzzin and you bug my crew

[Chorus 2X]

[AMG]
(Aowwww) I used to drink Olde E, now I sip Moet
Hangin with the jet set
And the hoes know my records sell (records sell)
So they all eat a dick up well
From state to state, they can’t wait
for me to rock a show, then I’ma knock your hoe
Countin dates in my gated estate
(Ya fool) I got your girl naked in the pool
(Aowwww, hittin that indo) What?
(She just called her friends so)
So we can have a big Three’s Company
Two big booties in front of me
Put my rubber on, before we get to humpin
Hit it from the back, like she stole somethin
Bust a big nut, then I’m snorin
cause when the hoes get to talkin, they borin
And it’s a shame, niggaz fallin for the okeydoke
The whip appeal is a joke
And like I said, I’ll be your personal 304
When I’m done, hit the do’

[Chorus 2X]

[AMG]
(Aowwww) I’m just a player on the run, havin fun
in the California sun, hit me one
And the leather and wood, I got my boys in the hood
and they ain’t slippin while they grip trippin
Bumpin hoes and, baby if you’re fly you’re gettin chosen
I scoop a freak like you’re frozen
And I like ‘em when they got a little game
No drama, just a fly little hot momma
Ready and willin, big booty for the killin
(What what?) But don’t be catchin no feelings
Cause a hoe is still a hoe, and I can’t be witcha
if 20 niggaz done hit ya, bitch
I got the 4-1-1, on your hoochie cootchie
Just a groupie, thinkin you can soup me
But you gotta be more than a trick tramp big booty hoe
to fade this nigga though

[Chorus 4X]

(Son let me break it down)
Bobby B Presents, One Session
"I, need, you..."
Be on the lookout for that album, "The Family Jewels"
"I, need, you..." 
This is "The Hidden Treasures Volume 1"
"I, need, you..." 
Let’s go

[Verse One]
First in the studio, last to leave
Compose somethin so beautiful to grab the streets
And put the hood on my back for the love of the art
It’s like a movie for the culture and I’m playin my part
This is more than a song for people to dance to
There’s a message in the song that’s sayin I need you
Like a kick need a snare and a couple, need a pair
You the life of the party and life, needs air
So I breathe through you, speak to you, eat shit and sleep to you
Only the finest of breaks before I do you
No quickies on a pen when my patience wear thin
I re-up with my breddern, and write it again
We the truth, the "Treasures" in a precious recording
"The Family Jewels" is the answer to what’s more important
I need you

"I need you"
(Yeah yeah yeah son let me break it down for you)
"I, need, you..."  "I need you"
"I, need, you..."  "I need you"
(Yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse Two]
Yo, uh-huh
Aiyyo these cats must be kiddin, truth is now risen
Dough in the position turn stones on every mission
I found out what’s missin, listen it’s you
Come through the Session, greet it with real love
Family, open arms, pounds and hugs
Leave that shit at the door cause it was what it was
Guess your vision must be cloudy you been ridin the bud
Paintin pictures with your images, graffiti walls and benches
In spots of recognition, part of what the mission is
Rap artists regardless of what your digits is
Here to exploit and expose your rap businesses
Shifty management, gangster record labels
The scene is saturated and your team is unstable
And eclipse to you lightweight cats, handlin that
The fact is we robbin you of platinum plaques
Hey yo I’m tryin to bring the neighborhood back, get up on that
And roll with the voice on the track

"I need you"
(Yeah yeah yeah son let me break it down for you)
"I, need, you..."  "I need you"
"I, need, you..."  "I need you"
"I, need, you..."
(Yeah yeah yeah son let me break it down)


Bang your head... bang, your, head!
Bang your head... bang, your, head!

[Grym Reaper] Rzarector!

[Rzarector]
You are not the same that I was when I was younger
I’m old with the Clan from my land, down under
Deep in the darkness, just like you regardless
Of who?  It’s obvious!  Wee... ha!
So lounge in my burial ground, boy, my despot
I build a house on top, of Salem’s Lot
Front porch, bloody, back yard, muddy
Like Amityville, a family kills
Force of humanity, drove me to insanity
Duel in all my rivalries, I speak of profanity
Motherfuck this!  Motherfuck that!  Bang your, head!

Chorus

[Someone (Don’t know the guy’s name)]
Here comes the killer with the GraveDigga sword, gimme room
Like devils in a Ouiji board I’m spellin’ doom
Ever since

Verse 1
-------

Swollen Pockets, inflation of pocksectomy
Caught from constant sweatin’ of me which I fought
with anti-perspirant
A total loss, cuz it only works when
sweat is physical not mental
And when its mental potential disorder
Like H20 = Water
it’s sorta on the border of the Vapors
One day, chillin’ at Green Acres
Me and the fellas just cruisin’ through
Sound system blastin’ as usual
I saw this chick, she was legit, she was wit’
The Pillsbury Dough Boy, I mean her boyfriend
She played him like a marshmellow
when she said, "Oh gosh! There go Phase!"
and rushed me like a quarterback
Asked me for my autograph, I laughed
Pulled out my pen, asked her where she wanted it
She lifted up her shirt and said "Write it on my stomach"
Swollen Pockets...

Verse 2
-------

How can I make a livin’?
Sellin’ drugs, performin’ at clubs
Or makin’ license plates in prison?
I chose b) see? So now I’m good to G-O
Where’s the brother with my dough?
He tried to snow me in a sum of Miami
He d-e-efinitely gets a eye jammy, word to Granny
I speak the truth, ask Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, unless you’re kinda
funny, honey, speak to a comedian
cuz you’re disobedient
I’m on a F-Train, or you might see me in a Blazer
with Phase written on the side and
slippin’ and slidin’ in sauce
Writing with force
Rhythm take control, it’s yours
Swollen Pockets...

Verse 3
-------

You sniff and sneeze and cough
And (?) medicine
Tylenol, Excederin
Dristan and Buffrin, didn’t do nothin’
I’m still suffering
I’m not a star, cuz stars seem to fall
Like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar I stand tall
And high, but keep a low pro’
I’m not a baker, but I still roll the dough
I’m solo, single, I like to mingle
Pockets bulked like Hulk, played by Lou Ferrigno
I’m sick of this, it’s gettin’ quite ridiculous
You’re sweatin’ me, gettin’ me steamed, makin’ it seem
like I’m arrogant, conceited and obnoxious
It’s not my fault, it’s the result of Swollen Pockets...

[Young Sicc]
Woo, yeah
Young Sicc, back up in the house
Representing San Diego, Killafornia
You know what I’m saying, we came to party y’all
Those of y’all that don’t wanna party, need to exit
You know what I’m saying
And for all you ladies up in here being stuck up
You need to find an exit cuz we came to party
Check it out dog
It’s like bang to the boogie, boogie to the bang
Stepped up on stage, ladies screaming my name
You know the game that we kick dog, we come correct
Ain’t no need to player hate dog, what you expect
Ey what’s up baby boo, I seen you all staring
Got a woody in my pants from the clothes that you’re wearing
Sucking on that lollipop, knowing that you’re hot
Thick brown ass, nice dress with cheetah spots
G’d up like a villain, I’m chilling with this forty
Posted at the spot, screaming ‘where the party at’
But knowing damn well that everybody’s at downtown clubbing
Trying to pick up on the Highland cats
Spitting at my homeboy, I’m spitting at your homegirl
Drink up on the liquor guaranteed to get it on girl
Cuz we could just boogie all night
Party people need to scream if you’re feeling alright, cuz

[Chorus: VMF]
We came here to party
We came to party
Sipping on the bomb and boogie all night long
We came here to party
We came to party
Sipping on the bomb and boogie all night long

[Young Sicc]
You say you heard of me, you heard of Young Sicc? Well that’s me
You say you saw me in the clubs last week
Touching anaconda, calling me a nasty freak
Slip my paws through your draws, squeezing on the ass cheeks
Now if you wanna flirt, baby girl we can play
But watch how you play when I’m sipping on the bombay
Mixed with minute maid like my dog GPA
See we out getting pussy, we out getting paid
All deep up in the cut, doggy dogs give it up
Toss your hood to the moon, got you moving to the tune
Plenty ass in the room, got me adventuring
Numbers on the palm with more ladies entering
Tell me can I get that, tell me can I hit that
Won’t take long before Sicc gone get with that
Spit that game like a true player do
Mob up in the spot and this is what we say fool
[Chorus]

[Young Sicc]
We +Boogie Down+ like +Productions+ so check your function
It’s only mandatory that we keep the crowd bumping
Jumping, hitting like a six-four Impala
Kicking it with us, cuz we’re the big ballers
Hittman with a couple grand, flash in the hand
Ain’t no youngsters in the club, just some grown ass men
Two-one years or older, soldiers all around
Love the way you shake it baby, move it up and down
Got that ass all wiggling, titties all jiggling
Laughing and giggling, body all sizzling
Stepping on Timberlands, bumping, grinding
Thoughts up in the head got me thinking dirty minded
Eses deep, Rips in the house
San Diego area known to put it down
Club hopping downtown, now what we gonna do
Is it E Street Alley or is it Blue Tattoo, cuz

[Chorus x2]

.
.
To all the tramp gold diggers
It’s that nigga Mally G
Got a stretch limo
If you wanna demo this info
When I rock you
I’m not about to knock ya
We could party all day
Until it’s time to fuck *ya, ya bitch*
See, I’m gonna tell you straight up
No need to wait up
I don’t wanna be no man 
Put a ring upon your hand
See, I can tell bout the way that you approach bitch
That you want a big dick up in your flow bitch
And then I ran true
Bitches like you
Did what I had to do
Then let you run true the crew
And all that cum in your mouth that ain’t no needing
Slow down bitch, cuz you’re speeding
I like weed and cash
Rolling with my doggs on five
Claim them with a nine
Bitch coming down the dozing on a sunny day
And get done by Jamal

Course
I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

Bitches acting funny
Fuck that, it ain\xc2\x92t no mater to me
See I don’t tramp *tell them why*
I maintain my
And still shine
I know this chick named Fay
Just to always come true, fucking with my nigga Tay
*trick bitch*
But I don’t give a fuck
Beside, this bitch was quite tight 
And she had a fat right
So I pulled it to the side on day
She was rolling down the block, on her way to see Tay
Spaces shit of the topic
Told the bitch hope in
Got the bitch hot 
And let em know who rock the smack the racket
Back and dizzy, I was gone
She said that her man was sleeping the next day, so it’s on
The day passed
She came on the aftermath
Throw the bitch seen
Cucked the belly with the cream
And I opened the scene and the time flied by fast
At last, I’m about to put the dick up in the ass
She rolled dick to three in the morning
Then I said who long you’ve been blowing
And then she’s all over my dick
And I ain’t mad one bit

Course
I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

After talk:

Make you wanna kill a motherfucker

Lose your whole shit 

stinking ass bitches

Course:

I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

I will put this in the shortest term known to me:
Don’t trust no bitch

Mally G got too much cash

[Intro]
Brrrrrr! {*scratched: "Uh oh"*}
(?) workin the whole coast baby
{"That’s right y’all!" - Redman}
I rock mics {*"Uh oh"*}
Whattup Ev, Jake One
Los Skangeles, yo, yo
(Here we go!)

[Rakaa Iriscience]
I know this kid right, he spit raps on mics
He said he did it cause he want a better chance at life
He felt like the last wolf preyin on cattle
From high school to night clubs to radio battles
His name Wu, his fame in the game too
The label meetings, lawyers, and managers came too
Before the ink was dry on the dotted line
They were tryin to redesign his life with pop shine
He found he’s a number, a product, a theme
But yesterday the A&R; was jockin his team
Now they wanna gamble with his art, life, and dream
(Yeah hopin that the ends justify the means)

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
"We come from where the ends justify the means" - Evidence

[Rakaa Iriscience]
I know this girl right, she used to dance at night
She said she did it cause she want a better chance at life
She used to undress slow, while others would strip fast
Sassy with class and ass to get cash
She got dough but focused on graduation
Pre-med, if she has patience she’ll have patients
Catch her with anatomy books on her breaks
or hustlin cats, conventions to vacations
Hit on, spit on, and lusted for
Too close to quit thinkin "What’s it for?"
Cryin in the steam, still tryin to scrub herself clean
(But the ends justify the means)

[Chorus]

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Aight check it check it
I know this cat right, he flip sacks at night
He did it so his daughter’d have a chance at life
To keep the lights on and make sure the snacks were right
No ice but his hats didn’t match his Nikes
Money rolls and rubber bands, stacks were tight
He turned turned out his own block, how sad the sight
For his baby girl, that little lady’s his world
But when beef came he had to react and fight
He was pumpin out in front of his crib, makin a killin
When he seen some fiends comin up the block illin
There was somethin ‘bout the scene he was not feeling
He ain’t tryin to get popped or get caught dealin
But then three shots came from what he thought were fiends
He woulda shot back but ran towards his daughter’s screams
One hit her pillow, two hit her TV screen
(He wondered if the ends justified the means)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
{*scratched to end: "That’s right y’all!" - Redman*}

[Intro]
Time...
That’s something you can’t get back
It’s precious
It’s of the essence

Your bitch said she wanted to fuck
I told her I ain’t have time
Counting this money taking up too much of my time
Use it wisely
You never know when your time going to be out
You dig?

[Chorus]
I ain’t got time to fuck no bitches
I ain’t got time to go on no dates
I ain’t got time to be out here tricking
I ain’t got time cause time don’t wait
I ain’t got time to nickel and dime
I ain’t got time to get no sleep
I ain’t got time to waste my time
I ain’t got time to drag my feet

I ain’t got time
I ain’t got time
I ain’t got time
I ain’t got no time
I ain’t got no mother fucking time
To be getting caught with nicks and dimes

I ain’t got time
I ain’t got time
I ain’t got time
I ain’t got no time
I ain’t got no mother fucking time
To be out here playing
Wasting no time

[Verse 1]
Just left New York
I was in Time Square
Cooling on Broadway
For the first time
I wasn’t even there for a whole day, okay
I would have spent a full day
But I didn’t have time

It was straight from the airport
Right to the plug
Doing business over lunch
Wasn’t no playtime
Then right back to the airport
At the gate, had your bitch on Facetime

Might pop Molly, make time move forward
Might sip lean so the time move slower
My bitch mad, I ain’t got time for it
Only time I see her is through this new Tom Ford’s

I’ve got a short temper
Full of bull shit, I can’t keep calm
Any second I could go off
Like a ticking time bomb

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Young rich nigga
Made a milli off of swiping
Back for the first time
Had the world going nuts
On one line

One time for the real niggas
Two times for the drug dealers
Three times for the trill niggas
Four times for the young niggas
And I’ve got five shots for you dumb niggas

Once upon a time in a hood near you
A nigga hit a lick in a drop near you
Trying to duck one time
Get on mighty rearview
I’m gonna tell you one time about Que

I’ve got a short temper
Full of bull shit, I can’t keep calm
Any second I could go off
Like a ticking time bomb

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Your time is up now
Thank you kindly
Let me get right here
Appreciate it
Que!

[Phonte] (Sy Smith)
In the corner, of my eye
I saw you in Rudy’s, you were very high
Yooooou were high... It was a cryin’ disgrace
(They saw your face..) 
On the counter, by your keys
Was a book of numbers, and your remedies
Onnnne of these, surely will screen out the sorrow
But where are you, tomorrooooow?

[Chrous: Phonte] (Sy Smith)
I can’t cry anymore, while you run arooooound
(While you run aroooooound...)
Break away... just when it seems so clear
that it’s, over now
Drink your big, black, cow, and get out of herrrre

[Phonte] (Sy Smith)
Down to Green St., there you go
Lookin so outrageous, and they tell you so
Yooooou should know... How all the pros play the game
(You change your name...)
like a gangster, on the run
You will stagger homeward, to your precious one
I’mmmmm the one... who must make everything right
Talk it out, ‘til dayliiiight..

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
all the seeds of Abraham stepping into the jam
pump your fist and enlist with the Great I Am
we came to rock these hands up high and defy
some gravity we casually infiltrating your high fi
seeds of Abraham up in the jam
pump your fist like you can’t resist the program
while we rock these hands up high and defy
some gravity we casually infiltrating your high fi

[Verse 1]
we infiltrating casually causing some casualty it had to be
a principality trying to battle me it rattled me not
I got too much soul plus control of this
Mic device I’m leaving sliced from the Spirit within
That sin ain’t never crossed it lost back in the day
While it’s testing I’m blessing the word play
Stay tight like lasso Pablo Picasso
Bringing art thru a poem canvas metronome
My home page is locked up in a spiral
I rival with words of enemies from Most High
We try to lock up destiny on top of this microphone
Waiting till the day my crew blows up like firestone
On an SUV cause when I bless you’ll be
Inside a state of shock cause how I rock the SMPTE
With tones for time codes and modes on full force
I’m living narrowly righteousness the course

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They wanted truth dropped in the booth they wanted proof
That the resurrected risen Son is busy giving one, two, threes
When I’m checking degrees my mic burn
It was red hot after it got to my turn
Watch the world turn never concerned with what it offer me
Watch it confound the wise so they could scoff at me
Their righteousness for self tells me they’re wack
Plus they jack four minutes I ain’t never getting back
Yet the fact remains I’m busy smacking names
And taking aim at a market that’s black, jargon attack
The white sheets I fight beats bare knuckling chuckling
At all it’s weakness, speak this poem
So heads could freely roam like a cellular phone I’ve known
Many a man doing wrong in a song so the gong rings
Sings vibrato in staccato, till exit stage left is their unofficial motto

[Chorus]

[Kail]
Alright N.A., it’s a couple years after Justine
I think this bitch is barely legal enough for us to work with right now
No we don’t want no motherfuckin free tour guides, know what I’m sayin?
And no fuckin free stress tests either, y’know we out here workin
Wendy, what’s happenin? Let ‘em know what you are baby, like that
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, itty bitty, itty bitty
Itty bitty bitty bitty bitty BITCH~!

Daisy Duck animated, just graduated
Old niggaz have to love it, old sluts have to hate it
It’s kind of silly, but she turned into the eye of the tigerlily
Right after she learned how to ride a willy
My one woman street team
Ass fat enough to be a billboard for her Lee Jeans
Her hustle SENSATIONAL! I gave her just one copy
of the invitational and we were both paid in full
I’m like her Daddy Warbucks
She makes me look tres chic, at all the couture clubs
Better advertisement, than my picture on a tourbus
My micro mini knows how to use her youth as a shortcut
She’s fresh out of high school, senior year
Although she appears of age to legally drink a beer
Saw her at my show and had to ask what brings you here
Couldn’t hear her over the noise in my ringin ears
But I gave her a CD
And now a bunch of peeps I don’t know come to my shows to see me
And I get mad MySpace friend requests
Not knowin it’s Wendy that got me in this mess
Now it may sound like a complaint, but it ain’t
Wendy showin me love that I’m not tryin to taint
Cause of her, it’s easier for my name to circulate
It’s like I gone fishin and I got the perfect bait

[Chorus]
This is for my, Mega micro mini miss
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitch
Soon as she get grown then she won’t fuck with me
Put my Peter pants on so you don’t grow up Wendy!
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty BITCH~!
Wendy where you at? Wha-wha-Wendy where you at?
Wha-wha-Wendy wha-Wendy, wha-wha-Wendy where you at? (BITCH~!)

[Kail]
My Wendys ain’t scholars, they only enrolled in L.A. City College
To catch niggaz student loan dollars
I hit her up after school, she’s still in metal shop
But somehow knows to use that ass as a tool
She can work them legs to walk you right into the show
Caress your left hand while the right one spends the dough
When they tell you the price she whispers in your ear
You’ll trick half your stack just because you can’t hear
Put your ass in the seat when she wiggles her rear
Then licks her lip one time so you can buy her a beer
And then without even stayin the night
The 2:12 bus makes her curfew before the street lights
Things with Wendy were wonderful until a couple months ago
when she stopped comin to my shows
I tried to track her down, I even asked around
I looked everywhere, but Wendy can’t be found
And as much as I want her to come back again
I realize that all good things have to end
My shows ain’t as crowded as when she packed ‘em in
And it’s been a week since someone tried to add me as a friend
But you know what’s kind of bugged?
I saw her outside a club promotin some rapper that looked like a thug
Had me trippin like shoes with loose strings
But I ain’t even mad ma, keep doin your thing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Itty bitty, itty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
City bitty, itty bitty, bitty bitty
So itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
She itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Wendy’s itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
She’s my itty bitty fo fitty itty bitty fo fitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, itty bitty, bitty BITCH~!

Yeah it’s 2008
We runnin ‘em back N.A.
Y’knahmsayin, these niggaz to get they street teams up
Knahmsayin? My Wendy got more energy than a motherfucker
She out there with a Monster drinkin and a handful of fires nigga
Y’knahmsayin it’s the motherfuckin butcher, once again
Who else was it gon’ be, y’knahmsayin?
Drop this shit out nigga
It’s Wendy, "True Hollywood Squares" motherfuckers

{*Mega Man 3 "Gemini Man" stage music to end*}

I ain’t on the guest list
I ain’t VIP

Welcome to our wonderful establishment
Ladies lineup to the left
Guy’s lineup to the right
No single (?) tonight
No jeans, hats, sneakers, two-ways, anything hip hop
And you with the wife beater don’t even bother waitin on line
Thank you and have a good night

[Verse 1: Rok One]
Ayo I’m getting restless (Why?)
Watchin the bouncer check the guest list
He just let six chicks past us (That’s to be expected)
Man, sometimes guys can be so sexist
Yo I don’t push an Ac or Lexus
Pack nine or rock a platinum necklace
I’m just tryin’ to party like the next kid
Mack dimes and maybe cop some breakfast
I don’t act reckless (naw)
And I like to have fun without being disrespected
But sometimes (?) be on a power trip
Have you waitin’ for an hour, you know how it is
Forty below Zero in the dead of winter
The whole club passes you before you get to enter
And you can’t move cause your bodies frozen stiff
Icicles startin’ to form from your nose and shit
And the crowd behind you is startin’ to get heated
Don’t panic, you’re far from being defeated
If you can’t get in to the jam, here’s the plan
Just beat that bouncer down right where he stand

[Hook]
You gonna let ‘em show disrespect? (Hell No!)
When you step up in the discoth\xc3\xa8que (Hell No!)
You better keep that bullshit in check
So what if you’re the bouncer dude, you’re still gettin’ wrecked
It’s a threat!

Gonna let this cat diss your crew? (Hell No!)
There’s only one of him and six of you (Hell No!)
He’s a big dude, this is true
But the bigger they come, the harder they fall
Somebody hit this dude!

[Verse 2: Rok One]
A different night, a different club, same lame shit
Bouncer tried to hate on me cause I ain’t famous
He gotta Six Eight frame and damn he’s brainless
Attitude like he got something up his anus
Askin’ every woman on the line what her name was
But they ain’t hollerin’ back cause they’s high maintenance
And he’s about Four Hundred pounds and quite heinous
This is when I made his unfortunate acquaintance
Talkin ‘bout:
(I’m gonna need to see some ID homie)
(And by the way, tonight is VIP only)
Oh really?
(So unless you frequent this scene/
there ain’t no chance you gettin inside sportin’ Hats, Sneakers and jeans)
I said don’t try to play me for the herb son
I am VIP: a Very Impatient Person
You tryin’ to diss my gear? What’s up with chu?
He said "Fuck you white boy and fuck your crew"
I was like "Whoa! Don’t even go there slick"
I can see this argument is going nowhere quick
And just for that he caught (?) of my whole damn clique
He didn’t co-operate so yo that’s it
It could be drama for a cat if he’s sleepin’
Don’t realize that I’m holdin sixty deep
So we forced are way in to the place, left him unconscious
With timberland tracks imprinted in on his face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rok One]
One night I was out with my peeps
On line at the 50 Cent album release
It was supposed to be free until eleven
It was Ten Fifty-Nine before anyone got let in
Again I see another girl cut in front of me
Again I’m face to face with a Suge Night wannabe
Coppin’ a cheap (?) searchin’ my personal for weaponry
They wanna check my ID, damn don’t you recognize me?
(Who you?) I’m Eminem, better ask around
This cat couldn’t see my crown because my hat was down
He grabbed it and said "Your hair ain’t platinum, clown"
Said I bought "Just for Men" and it went back to Brown
(Yeah whatever, you ain’t gettin’ in asshole)
Oh did I say Eminem? Yo I meant Fat Joe
(Fat Joe? Man you look like Kate Moss)
Well lately I’ve been going through weight loss
I’m Jay-Z
(What? Jigga’s black, you’s not)
I got the same skin disease Michael Jackson got
I’m the manager for Britney Spears (Yeah right)
And Big L (Big L’s been dead for six years)
Oh well, I guess we’ll switch to plan B
Fuck talkin’, it’s time to start the stampede
We didn’t like his attitude
So y’all brothers know what we hadda do
We bumrushed the door

[Hook]

[Verse One]
Here I go again
Drifting from home
And I’m all alone
Driving on the 10
Freeway late at night
Going towards the shore
But what the hell for
Cause all we gonna do is fight

[Chorus]
I’m pretending what I feel
Trapped inside, what’s not real
And you tell me all I need to know
Yet it blows away 
And I’m all a-

[Verse Two]
And here I am
Standing at your door
Just like before
Cause it’s all a game
They named us as pawns
And we’re pros at this
That’s when we kiss
And lost what was gone
Gasping for air
Searching for ground
Sinking in my sound
But there’s nothing there

[Chorus] [x2]
I’m pretending what I feel
Trapped inside what’s not real
And you tell me all i need to know, but

And I’m all alone [8x] 
And I’m all a-

[Verse Three]
I’m sorry now
What was I to do?
I’m way past blue
Makes me wonder how
Could I sink so deep?
Drowning in my tears
Can’t even see my peers
I think I’ll go to sleep

[Chorus] [x4]
I’m pretending what I feel
Trapped inside what’s not real
And you tell me all I need to know, but

And I’m all alone
I am near you, I am near you my son
My son, My son
My dear son, My son
Come home, Come home
My dear son
Come home, Come home

[Intro: Tony Touch Scratchin]
Never takin shorts ‘cause Brooklyn’s the borough-"Guru"
P-P-P-Peace out to Brooklyn!

[Papoose] (Tony Touch Scratchin)
Yeah! Fresh off that Brooklyn Bridge man!
Representin with the hip hop legend
Tony Touch! Tony Toca! King of New York talk man! (Br-Brooklyn!)
I’m back on my bullshit! Thuga! Papoose Pa-poose!

[Verse One: Papoose]
I don’t care ‘bout the name of your clothin designer
I’m fascinated by the attribute of Malcolm and Elijah
Hoopty when it’s drama we hopin out of the mazda
Strip like Gaza the coppers in the impala
If not the pocket rocker the chopper do sum’n proper
Shoot you out your shoes get popped out of your prada’s
In ‘01, I was gettin dollars with the robbers
Rob weed spots for hours and early hours
Skin smellin like sour when they was blamin Osama
So I was in the shower when they was droppin the towers
Actin like a mobster you Hoffa you an imposter
Somethin like spaghetti, tomatoes, garlic and salsa
Bullets out the llama the top is usually copper
You judgin my persona your honor, this is karma
Put an end to your saga with revolvers 
McDonalds and Burger King guns the Big Mac and the Whopper
Eat your bodyguard, Kevin Cosner, Jeffrey Dahmer
Old school, leather bomber heavy armor
Damn they love when I was flowin on the stoop 
But hated on me when I started flowin in the booth
You a contradiction and they know you was a fluke
So they said that’s the same nigga you told us was the truth
You a lame I know you wouldn’t shoot
You make me wanna take your chain off your neck and throw it on the roof
A spark to a flame a flame to a fire
A fire to a blaze I’m burnin all you liars

[Interlude: Tony Touch Scratchin]
Never takin shorts ‘cause Brooklyn’s the borough-"Guru"
Pe-Pe-Pe-Peace out to Brooklyn!

[Uncle Murda] (Tony Touch Scratchin) 
Brooklyn! (Br-Br-Br-Brooklyn!) EAST NEW YORK!!!!!
(GO BROOKLYN! GO BROOKLYN! GO BROOKLYN! GO BROOKLYN!-"Stetsasonic")
TONY TOUCH WHATTUP NIGGA?! (Br-Brooklyn!)

[Verse Two: Uncle Murda]
I’m the bad guy in the movie that keep comin back (JASON!)
The kid that can’t die no matter where I get clapped 
I never back down from no man (NEVER!)
And mami when you go down, don’t use no hands 
Look my semi automatic fully loaded
Emptyin the informant face then reloadin (BANG!)
Shorty can’t give me head or she ain’t ‘gon deep throat it (NAH!)
I’m the realest rapper that ever touched the mic and the streets know it (YA HEARD!)
I break a DJ arm if he don’t play my shit
I’m the kid when you was young your mom would want me to play with
They use to call me mischievous 
I never was a follower, I’m the example of what a leader is (YEAH!!!)
I’m in the game for real my nigga I don’t know how they walk (FOR REAL!)
You gotta cop a brick and better we don’t do 8 balls (WE DON’T DO THAT!)
You gotta hustle harder, they can’t see me yet (NAH!)
I don’t see ‘em like Stevie Wonder ain’t see his kids yet

Cookin’ Soul

[ CHORUS: Yukmouth ]
We gettin high on the freeway, drivin with my knees
Kissin on my lean, nigga, twistin up the trees
I don’t fuck with sticks and seeds, don’t gimme no bammer weed
If it ain’t them scout cookies then I fuck with OG
[ CHORUS: Blanco ]
And I’m higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on them cookies
Got me higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on that OG
And I’m higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on them cookies
Got me higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on that OG

[ VERSE 1: Blanco ]
I break it down, start rollin like a Rolex
And then I flip it like a Rolodex
And this one here is to the neck
Cause baby, I just smoke the best
I’m the fuckin weed king
It’s like I’m a human triple beam
Smokin joints, sippin lean
Yeah I’m ballin, so these bitches got me triple-teamed
And I’m just chillin with my stoner girl
Talkin shit like ‘Baby, I’ma run the world’
Fuckin run for president
I’m spittin game, so you don’t need to question it
(Shhh...) And ain’t no second-guessin it
I smoke the best of it, y’all can smoke the rest of it
Good weed, I invest in it
50 p’s a week, that’s just an estimate

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]
I wake up and bake up to the finest kush
I took a TwitPic, hit my timeline and look
I blow designer kush, rockin with that Charlie Sheen
OG, Big Doh, I’m on the winning team
Po’ a fo’ of lean, my styrofoam frosty
Actavis got me noddin off with a coffee
With my nigga Jack rollin bags of that Barney
And my kush so loud it can wake up Bob Marley
Louder than a Harley bike, stronger than the X-Men
Smokeathon veteran, black Willie Nelson
Smokin AK-47 up in room 420, Coughee Brotha like Devin
Veteran, you niggas get yo weed from dispensaries
I know the grower with the tree, he let me pick the weed
Boss shit, I’m right there when they clip the weed
He say he smokin’ mo’ than Yuk - hah, nigga please

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Dru Down ]
I’m smokin cookies, got the munchies, milk and cookies
On the highway gettin head in a hybrid
It’s like a cloud on the ground with some wheels on it
Leave a strong smell, when I burn rubber its’s real, homie
Kush capitol from the Bay to the Big Apple
Like Snapple - the Best up on Earth
That’s the slogan, cause the weed I smoke is so potent
High on the daily, so I won’t have to go crazy
( ? ) I push, I’m in a Explorer Van
580, 880, a Town tour, man
So high like the sky, just call me fly guy
When it’s time to go there come to me and know I
Burn them trees, I’m drinkin, got women flockin, they jockin
I’m not trippin, I’m high - and plus it’s pimpin
So get it right, don’t fuck up my high, hoe
Or just listen to the hook or catch a hook

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4: Richie Rich ]
I’m into clippin clones and usin different phones
Started just blowin sacks, now I be smokin zones
Some niggas call ‘em zips, we used to call ‘em O’s
I’m under heavy stress, that’s why I got to blow
Drop 7 in a zag, call that shit Michael Vick
Just got out of jail but I’m back on my shit
Just do a Hail Mary, a ten pack of grapes
Got niggas catchin my passes in mo’ than 20 states
I’m high as ( ? ) pussy, smokin that drippy stem
Them girl scouts is out lookin for Richie Rich
My bitch bought a box, I told her shut the do’
I smelled the bud, ran outside and bought a couple mo’
I’m into blowin kush, I like to smell a dream
Purple’s my favorite color, but OG kush is green
You see me in the traffic, just know I’m movin mean
High as giraffe pussy, and that’s on everything

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 5: B-Legit ]
I gets deeper than a dolphin off the blue dolphin
And I don’t do it often but the cookie got me coughin
I probably need a coffin, some narcos and oxycodones
A bad bitch to roll the bela while the B-La ploddin
A Cali state of mind, oh yeah I’m doin fine
Don’t waste no time chasin paper, nigga, paper mine
This bitch fine and she ask could she ride and laughed
I told her hell yeah and broke her off the other half
Now here my autograph, a body like a dancer
Plus her head game is sick, call her brain cancer
She addicated to this dick, call her Nohanna
Plus I’m higher than a plane, I see you in Atlanta
Bosses do what they do, them suckers what they can
I stay stokin on good with Jane and Mary-Ann
Might even roll in yo hood with that contraband
I’m wet as Aquaman, B-La get it poppin, man

[ CHORUS ]

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus] - 3x
Some of these niggaz be some cockroaches
Crosses from heart no good mon set them on fire

[Skinny Pimp]
Bitch I push weight state to state you can fake

In your talking ass mouth now how you like me now huh!!

[Chorus] - 4x

[Skinny Pimp]
Once upon a time in the East Memphis streets
I was at the crib watching screen TV
The radio was on just a little bit low
Until I heard some shit that made me turn it up some more
"Lookin For Tha Chewin" beat without my damn vocals
I’m selling in every state but dammit he calling me local
Now ain’t that a bitch they cut my verse on every mix show
What’s up with you and Boogaloo y’all some hoes
Tryna hold a negro down in this little bitty town
But I’ma stay around just to cook y’all clowns
Every time y’all hate on the radio
I’ma cook y’all on my album hoes
Over and over over again cause bitch I’ma sell
Watch out for my book called "Get It How You Live"
Y’all some baller blocking bitches in the Memphis city streets
Don’t come up in my face saying shit to me, not shit nigga!!

[Chorus] - 6x

[Skinny Pimp]
Scary ass bitches when we hit we hit hard
Foolish hoes dodge from a million killas march
Dump on some chumps cause they can’t fuck with me
I’ll bang your ass nigga Skinny Pimp super busy
From the real peep my folks who got much respect
Living kind of prejudice so put him in check
I’m sending this out to my cuz Co-Co
My nigga got life they said he killed the po-po
So pass the dope and pack out my shows
Mug them bitches and throw some beer on them hoes
Fuck y’all connections and you groupie haters join it
The bitch whole clique need their asshole torn
I’m doing this for my niggaz who don’t fuck with them suckers
And if you got some serious beef we’ll do y’all busters
Talking about y’all niggaz started us all
But everybody know the business bitch so watch us ball..

[ rest ]\t\tYeah, Cap?
\t\t\tWe gonna need a little scratch for the rap
\t\t\tNow Tone and Chasse
[ Tony Tone & Charley Chase ]\t
\t\t\tYeah crew?
[ all ]\t\t\tYou’re the DJ’s, whatcha gonna do?

(r) (ro) (rock)

[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tGuess what, y’all, I’m fresh
[ rest ]\t\t(What makes you think so, Cap?)
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tBecause I look so good, and I’m the lord of rap
[ rest ]\t\t(How fresh?)
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tSo fresh, that when I was young
\t\t\tI learned to drive women crazy with my tongue
[ rest]\t\t\t(Now, that’s fresh...)

[ J.D.L. ]\t\tYeah - well, I get wild
[ rest ]\t\t(What makes you say that, L?)
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tBecause it don’t take much to make me yell
[ rest ]\t\t(How wild?)
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tSo wild, that when I start to break
\t\t\tHey, you better step back and let me flake
[ rest ]\t\t(Now, that’s wild...)

[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tWell, I’m fly 
[ rest ]\t\t(Who told you that, Eazy?)
[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tYour girl, his mother, and my lady
[ rest ]\t\t(How fly?)
[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tSo fly, sometimes it seems 
\t\t\tAll I got to do is smile, and I get screams
[ rest ]\t\t(Now, that’s fly...)

[ Almighty K.G. ]\tI’m bold
[ rest ]\t\t(What gives you that impression, Kay?)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tBecause I don’t care what nobody say
[ rest ]\t\t(How bold?)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tSo bold, I smack a man with his gun
\t\t\tAnd kiss his woman, diss his mother, and don’t even run
[ rest ]\t\t(Now, that’s bold...)

[ all ]\t\t\tFresh, wild, fly and bold
\t\t\tAnd we’ll be that way till we grow old
\t\t\tFor the rest of our lives, as long as we live
\t\t\tWe’ll keep usin those adjectives
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tThat do describe
\t\t\tThe heart-breakin tribe
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tThat do permit
\t\t\tUs to go with
[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tA musical flow 
\t\t\tThat makes you say ho
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tWith a fresh rap style
\t\t\tTo make you go wild
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tCold Crush
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tUs 
[ Eahy A.D. ]\t\tDeep in the cut\t
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tAnd if you don’t believe we’re real
[ all ]\t\t\tThen touch\t
\t\t\tUs 
\t\t\tThe Cold Crush

( *scratching* )

[ all ]\t\t\tFresh, wild, fly and bold
\t\t\tYes, we’re what makes the Crush so cold
\t\t\tOur rhymes will freeze all fake MC’s
\t\t\tThat don’t say please before they cease
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tRhymes and routines that we make up
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tYou can’t pour juice in a fake cup
[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tThey cannot rape
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tSo they just rob
[ all ]\t\t\tBut a biter can’t do a real rapper’s job
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tBut if you’re hard-headed, and you still think so
\t\t\tGrab your rhymes and your mic
[ all ]\t\t\tAnd go for what you know

[ Almighty K.G. ]\tMy name is K.G
[ rest ]\t\t(better known as the Al-)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\t-mighty, and with the 3
[ rest ] \t\t(I’m sure you’ll call)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tOn us when your ear
[ rest ]\t\t(is in need for a treat)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tAnd if you don’t know, the K
[ rest ]\t\t(that’s who you got to meet)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tI’m 4th in line
[ rest ]\t\t(and in due time)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tAnd every rapper in the business 
[ rest ]\t\t(will know that I’m)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tSerious about this
[ rest ]\t\t(and I don’t play)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tI told a sucker MC that
[ rest ]\t\t(just the other day)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tCause I learned the ropes
[ rest ]\t\t(and paid my dues)
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tI’m goin for the gold
[ rest ]\t\t(no way that I can lose)

[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tIt’s Eazy A.D. that you wanted to be
\t\t\tEver since you saw me emcee
\t\t\tYou wanted to be down to learn how to rhyme
\t\t\tEven wanted your braids as long as mine
\t\t\tBut the rhymes I write are a real delight
\t\t\tIf you’re a true MC, you would not bite
\t\t\tOn me or them, just sit down and 
\t\t\tWrite a rhyme with your mind, paper or pen
\t\t\tBut you can’t, so you go, you will and you won’t
\t\t\tTake heed and feed and reap what I wrote

[ J.D.L. ]\t\tWhen I’m on the stage I go a little beserk
\t\t\tStart breakin, flakin, you know I do work
\t\t\tI try to get you on mine when I deliver my lines
\t\t\tCause it’s about makin ryhmes like no one else can design
\t\t\tI do everything I can to make myself better
\t\t\tLive on a steady diet of stages and ???
\t\t\tKnow all the celebs, so when I’m in the crowd
\t\t\tThey surround me like the press, scream my name out loud
\t\t\tSay
[ rest ]\t\tYo J.D.L.
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tWhat’s happenin?
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tWhere have you been?
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tWhen are you rockin again?
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tAnd when I’m boppin away, I hear a lot of them say
\t\t\t"Damn, I wanna be like the L one day"

[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tSo many bitin MC’s, you’re all a pain in my neck
\t\t\tThey should be sendin me your royalty check
\t\t\tYou just bit my rhymes, didn’t pay no tax
\t\t\tCopied the music from someone else, put it on wax
\t\t\tI’m mad as hell, cause it’s bound to sell
\t\t\tAnd you be bitin what I’m writin, and people can’t tell
\t\t\tYou change it around, disguise the sound
\t\t\tWith no prior desire to write, that’s why I frown
\t\t\tOn those of you that go shop too
\t\t\tBe original and write like the Captain do
\t\t\tSo put your teeth away, and try someday
\t\t\tAnd you can quote it, cause I wrote it only yesterday

[ all ]\t\t\tFresh!
[ Grandmaster Caz ]\tAnd unless I miss my guess
\t\t\tI’m the best, oh yes, beause I wrote the test
[ all ]\t\t\tWild!
[ J.D.L. ]\t\tHoney child on the top of the pile 
\t\t\tOnce in a while I crack a smile
[ all ]\t\t\tFly!
[ Eazy A.D. ]\t\tKnow why? Cause to the day I die 
\t\t\tI’ll always be the guy you won’t pass by
[ all ]\t\t\tBold!
[ Almighty K.G. ]\tSo cold and so hard to hold 
[ all ]\t\t\tAnd when they made the Cold Crush, they broke the mold
\t\t\tHah-huh!

\t\t\tMan, let’s get outta here, it’s Miller time
\t\t\tWord!
\t\t\tHuh!
\t\t\tHah! (hah)

        (Tic-toc)
        (Toc-tic) 3x

        (Tic-toc 
        You don’t stop)

        (You)
        (You don’t)
        (You don’t)
        (You don’t stop)
        (Hit it) 4x

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman, and make her your wife
I mean ugly, so bad you can’t look in her face
So fat she can’t go down and tie her shoe lace
Now the reason that I say this, is simple and plain
All the pretty girls, man, they just play games
With your mind and your time, they’re not with it
Cause if you ain’t got no money, then you might as well (hit it)
But with an ugly girl, man, they’ll simply adore ya
Like you can mess around and they’ll still be there for ya
Cause you’re all she has, and you’re all she can get
So run out and find yourself an ugly chick
They’ll be honest all the time, so boy, don’t pursue her
Cause she’s ugly as hell, nobody’ll talk to her
So what she’s a (bat) and a Godzilla (creature)
But it’s not how she looks, it’s how the girl (treats ya)
So if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman and make her your wife
Cause pretty girls’ll have you cryin the blues
But when a ugly girl leaves (she ain’t nothin to lose)
No

        (You)
        (You don’t)
        (You don’t)
        (You don’t stop)
        (Hit it) 3x

Now here’s a time of my life I won’t forget for the world
When Cash hooked me up with this ugly girl
He said (Marv, she’s bad, and she’s a musical producer)
But I shoulda known with a name like Medusa
When she opened the door, man, it wasn’t even funny
Cause the girl reminded me of King Kong Bundy
Bald-headed and fat, boy, she blew my mind
But she captured my heart (why) cause she was kind
Sat me down at the table for a bite to eat
Gave me a rose and a kiss on the cheek
My mind was in shock, man, I thought I was dreamin
Cause everytime I looked at her, I felt like screamin
I thought about leavin, but I stopped and chilled
Just thought to myself: can this be real?
She’s not pretty at all, but she treats me like a king
(Is that why you care for that ugly thing?)
Yeah Cash, you probably dog her and call her a creep
But you know what? (what?) beauty’s only skin deep
And no matter what you say, man, she seems to be sweet
Cause I’ve been datin her now for the past three weeks
So if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman (yup) and make her your wife
Cause pretty girls’ll have you cryin the blues
But when a ugly girl leaves (she ain’t nothin to lose)

And who I’m rollin’ wit

Somebody said you number 1 in the streets 
that’s why I’m coming for you first jackin’ your beat

Got robbed on the radio broad day public
The thugs loved it It’s not a game
Went solo on that ass but it’s still the same

(Holla Holla-Ja Rule)
Beat ROBBA ROBBA
Jackin’ rappers beats and make ‘em HOTTA HOTTA
Stealin’ all ya spins plus ya DOLLAS DOLLAS
Killas if you feel me just FOLLA FOLLA (What, Come on)

Even if it’s off your plate I gots to eat
I’m on some bullshit for no apparent reason
I want it wit y’all I’m ready to die breathin’

(Hate Me Now-Nas)
It’s the rappers I rob
The beats that I take
The labels I snake
For 30 grand help you perform at the wake
Touch ya life and everything I touch I take
Hate me now cuz later gon be too late
I merk you
Everything I spit is controversial
I’m the illest killa they ever signed to Universal
F the Fordham
I’m god son
As soon as they blink bet ya bottom dolla I’ma rob ‘em

(How To Rob-50 Cent)
My Sticky Fingaz turn fists across ya jaw
Beat ya ass in real life at the source awards
The real Fifty from Brooklyn god bless he got outed
You just a fake clown who front and rout about it 
I got a new deal
For a few mil
Shoot to kill
You fruity like Dru Hill
You spare change you ain’t even half a man cuz
Matter of fact you ain’t even half the man ya moms was

(Ha-Juvenile)
Oh you thought you was safe, Ha
Though you could escape, Ha
Cuz we label mates, Ha
Oh you thought I wouldn’t get yo cake, Ha
You thought that beat from the dirty south wasn’t gon get raped, Ha 
And birds wanna have Sticky baby, Ha
Dogs run around stayin’ Sticky crazy, Ha
He ain’t got no type of sense, Ha
No tellin’ what I do
Might even jack my own crew

(Throw Ya Gunz-Onyx)
The original take ‘em out bring ‘em out dead
Comin’ at me wrong kid I put that thing to ya head
Sticky Fingaz going for self call the cops
Don’t even talk to me about the Onyx shit you’ll get shot

(Play Around-Lil’ Cease)
5 o’clock in the morning killas at ya door
Colt 4-4 I’m puttin’ chalk on your floor
Find you up the block from ya house dead in the store
Work the beat like pigeons and I’m bucking ‘em all
Press ya luck and you’ll fall
Neva seen nothing this raw
I’m what the world been waitin’ for
Wait no more 
This wack shit can’t take no more
Should’ve been banned the streets should’ve made it a law

(What Ya Want-Eve)
I’m ready for war
What Ya niggas want (What, What, What, Bring it)

All y’all niggas sweet even rob Swizz Beats
Nowadays producers gettin’ 50 g’s

jerk you for ya pub I ain’t payin’ a fee
I just loop it up on the MPC

(The Party Is Goin’ On Over Here-Busta Rhymes)
Long as you live neva seen nothing this while
Took ya beat and flipped it right in my style
Just payin’ back niggas be bitin’ my style
And if it’s dead in the crowd I put some life in the crowd
God’s gift to the underground 
Running ‘em down
Fucking ‘em down
Empires be tumblin’ down
The end of the world is comin’ around
Throw ya ass in the ground
Nothing to lose
Changing the rules
Playin’ for keeps
I’ma shark in the waters it ain’t safe in the streets
Sticky Fingaz and I’m jackin’ for beats

[Intro]
Yah, uh huh
There comes that time, when you gotta give ‘em truth
And truth is light
So just know that if I die tonight
I left you with something
I left you with truth
Yah, yah\xc2\x85

[Verse 1]
Been a dreamer, cloud reacher
Aspirations of lavishing living, mackin’ kicking my feet up
On dat road to the riches, bangin’ keepin’ my heat tucked
Must of got the wrong map, them riches never come
Or never came, not in this crack game
Had to switch plans, maybe my name
Develop a flow as addictive as that cocaine
Highly flammable down right explosive, propane
Dreams of celebration’ wit my homies like we on man
The ones who been ridin’ like, are we there yet?
You ain’t got da answers for ‘em, it ain’t clear yet
Done hit a fork in da road, now you feeling near death
Politics, road blocks, all you want is success
Clock ticking failure, not an option you can live with
Only reason still makes sense why you in this

[Hook 1: X2]
Say Henni by the 5th, Newport to the Brownsville
That rebirth of ill, them other niggas sound real
They real life don’t match up, that audio track

[Verse 2]
Say they never had a friend like me, call it jealousy
Why these niggas switched up, think about it sensibly
Maybe more fame, more opportunity
Look me in the eye homie, you see the truth in me
It was us till them wheels fell off
Positions of power, trump that, here comes double cross
On Allah, I hold no malice, paybacks this mirror that I paint, clear canvas
Reflection you can’t look at, cot dammit
Shed light on these bastards, so underhanded
Plotting my demise, like you could crucify
A poor righteous teacher, box with the God
Go head, roll your sleeves up, these lies exposed
Davinci Code, white Jesus, never say die
Live by, lease believe it, for the hopeless and heavy hearted
People who really need this, I breath it
Nigga I bleed It, integrity I keep it
Lost my way for minute, like a scandalized deacon
Repent that, I ain’t preaching
Die on my feet instead of living on my knees and
Been a soldier Since Mack was a threat
And Pistol Pete was on street making T-shirts wet
Opposite side of the color line, my right been left
Crip my right been left

[Hook 2: X2]
Say Henni by the 5th, Newport to the Brownsville
That rebirth of ill, them other niggas sound real
They real life don’t match up, that audio track

* send corrections to the typist

[Intro: Wordsworth]
How long you plan to run
When the road ends, you can’t turn back and go the other way
That’s not a solution, that’s only refusin’
Now you trapped yourself in more sides in everyway

[Chorus: Wordsworth]
So where you gonna run now?
Nobody makes it alone so
Where you gonna run now?
No more places to hide so
Where you gonna run now?
No more places to stay so
Where you gonna run now?
Eventually you get caught

[Verse 1: Wordsworth]
Troublemaker in her teens, either love or hate her
Seeks attention make a scene wherever her mother takes her
Curses her out, attitude worse then her mouth
Used to work in the south, ‘til her aunt there kicked her out
Raising hell, acts invincible, yell back and spit at you
Held back in middle school, expelled, splapped the principal
Wilding out, nothing to be wild about
When her mom keeps her up to date with every style that’s out
Long Island house, got her own room
Behave and save, a crib and care, she’ll have her own soon
But shes very unappreciative gives all the credit to her dad
But the secret is her mom made him keep the kid
Doesn’t go to school, just another truant case
Trespassed at a high school and slashed a students face
Can’t go home police waiting
Tries to run away from her problems but they keep chasing

[Chorus: Wordsworth]

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Pops up on her pops porch
"My little girl came to see me, man it’s been a while" that’s what her pops thought
Scot-free at her pop’s crib
Thought her mom was being cruel
thought her father had no set of rules, but he got his
Chores, mop the floors, then scrub the walls
After 8: 00 no noise, phone calls, no boys
Mow the lawn, wash the car and dishes, clean the kitchen
Wake up, we excercise, your curfew’s at 9: 00
Was gonna teach her how to drive, couldn’t wait ‘till her father arrvied
And mischeif only keeps her occupied
Takes the keys while he went golfing, drove but not often
The store wasn’t that far she could’ve just walked it
Foot slips of the gas, but to avoid the crash
Hits a woman coming out of Pathmark carrying bags
Hit and ran, felt she was driving safe
A customer inside the gate of the parking lot got the license plate
Parks it back in the garage, paint scratched, try to match it on the car
With nail polish so the accident was solved
Cops drove up asking, "Sir, do you own a Maxima"
She was gone before they thought of asking her

[Chorus: Wordsworth]

[Breakdown]
Calls her aunt upstate with the estate and the house that’s by the lake
She said "I don’t want that drama down here"
Calls her ex boyfriend that moved in Portland, Oregon to get away
He said "I don’t want that drama down here"
Calls her cousin in Miami but the family called there before she did
They said "We don’t want that drama down here"
Last call to her uncle but he’s unaware
He said "Why don’t you call your mom and dad"
She’s like "Yeah, great idea"

[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
Whole city looking for her
Things escalated since the slashing and the hit and run in Brooklyn where they saw her
Changed her hairstyle, now in Staten Isle
Because she knows her grandma would never give up her grandchild
Blind in one eye barely could see who it was
Family always say they’ll visit but nobody does
Through the screen door recognized, boy she was surprised
Lonely, seen it in her eyes as she rushed her inside
"Does your mom know that your here" but really didn’t care
So delighted to see her, catching up on things, trying to feed her
Ran out of sugar, "I’ll go to the store for you"
Hands her the purse but not without going in it first
Opens the door, cops ambush from the trees
With rifles wedged in her temple yelling "Freeze!"

[ VERSE 1: Unique ]
This is me, U-n-i-q-u-e
By my side is B-u-g
And D-a-s-h-a-n
Lookin for new records to spin
And then he transforms and forms Voltron
And don’t defy my will cause my word is bond
I’m dangerous, just like dynamite
So don’t bite because this time you might
Choke, cough, throw up or suffocate
You have indigestion from the rhymes you ate
So think before you dare to speak and utter
You might find yourself belly up in the gutter
If you thinkin that we came to play
Unique, Dashan and Buggy B is three the hard way

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 2: Unique ]
We’re here to slice, dice, break, take and never fake
3, he, the other, then shake and bake
Fry, cook, boil, or in the oil
You’re like a flower, my rhymes are the soil
That’s one to grow on, so before you go on
Stage in a rage, yo, you better throw on
The proper head gear to continue this journey
Bring on your lawyer or an attorney
My rhymes’ll rip, you flip, your beats’ll trip ya
I’m like a Jew, my job is to ( ? ) ya
I’ll have you cryin, my record you were buyin
There’s no denyin or lyin I’m fryin, so stop tryin
To be like me, never try to cite me
Put on your mountain boots, go take a hike, see
What I was sayin, there’s never no delayin or playin
So start prayin, no better yet I want you to stay in-
side, order, prepare for the slaughter
If you’re over 40 introduce Unique to your daughter
And I’ll sport her like a pair of new kicks
( ? ) show us her new tricks
Give her the Buggs, let him take over and say
(Yeah, our crew is three the hard way)

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 3: MC Buggs ]
Now I guess it’s my turn to rap and I’m about to burn
Come to the teacher so that you can learn
All the tricks of the trade, you graduate each grade
And if you try to play hookey ( ? ) you made a mistake
Cause Buggy B, yes, I’m a hip-hop fiend
I surrend you in a minute if you know what I mean
So behold the light of truth is what you seek
So pay close attention as I start to speak
With the voice that is clear so you hear
Every word that I say because the time is near
This is the hour to devour all the sucker MC’s
I’m like a giant, you’re a midget with the shoes to your knees
So freeze ( ? ) halt, stop in you tracks
Step back cause I proceed to put the records on wax
You melt like butter, or should I say margerine
You gonna faint when the saints come marchin in
I’m not a biter, the title is a writer
Give up hope cause the rope is bein pulled tighter
So heed the warning if you wanna see morning
You come stormin when we’re performin
Now it’s time to pass the microphone to Dashan
He puts the left ( ? ) but he’s the right-hand man

(DJ Dashan)

[ VERSE 4: Dashan ]
Now I’m the DJ that loves to rap
You think you’re smart, you get caught in my booby trap
I’m hard-hittin, my crew’s tough like Bounty
We beat you down, have you leavin King’s County
I bumrush ya, crush ya, then hush ya
You’re just a pest and yes, it’s time to bust ya
Your best bet is to come to an agreement
Also slam your face into the cement
I make the music, then edit the cut
It’s copywritten, can’t be bitten, boy, you must be nuts
Go on and try me, deny me, you still will not get by me
When I rush your stupid ass you will be askin, ‘Why me’
It’s like a creature feature when I teach ya
Defeat ya, seat ya, beat ya, eat ya
You’re not with it so I might as well forget ya
Let the door knob hit you where the Good Lord split ya
Cause I’ll subract, react and smack your back
Get off the crack, you’re ridin on the wrong track
Cause I can shame and game and rip and tame ‘em
If there’s a problem you know that I blame ‘em
Don’t try to dis cause you know that’ it’s wack, black
I cut your dreads up as if I was snap back
So challenge me any time any day
And you will find out why they call us three the hard way

[ Professor X ]
Vanglorious
This is protected by the red, the black and the green
With a key
Sissyyyy

I don’t go outside as much as I used to
I’m not home, just in my house forgetting myself or at least trying to
But not forgiving until come back out
I have a light on in my room
During the day I hardly notice it
But at night it keeps me from falling asleep
I have this dream of knowing you
During the day I hardly notice it
But at night it keeps me from all other dreams
The numbing of time taught me how to finally fall asleep
I just wish you’d come home and teach me how to wake back up
This is torture, this is truth, this is unfamiliar pain
This is following an ache but this is love

There’s a railroad track behind my house
At night I can hear freight being taken to retail
But I’m still not sold on letting myself out
I never knew it was cold until I knew how the heat felt
You were always warm when put in warm place
But I was too shallow to contain the same flame
There’s a nicotine patch on my night stand
You never did quit but at least you tried
Or maybe you did but I never saw you lift a cigarette to your lips
I was preoccupied looking into my reflection and the way you said you felt alive
Your infection inflects the walls each night
And the shades of color are all black and white
Just like your goodbye
You said to stop letting your love consume my mind
I never did quit but at least you tried
I don’t go outside as much as I used to
I’m not home, I’m just trying to sleep at night
Forgetting your love or at least trying to
You said goodbye, now just say goodnight

I’m a professional

What up renzo
What up leon
What up breack neck
what up opio

[Verse 1: Salvador]
What up kizzo how ya been?
This goes out to you my friend
We been up in the lab assembling
I was gonna send you things for remembering
Hate my lifestyle nowadays
I’m in a zombie mindstate going crazy
I know I’m lazy ?I know it’s hazy?
?Going loco? like driving around with miss Daisy
I wanna pass out
Even thinking about taking my life while I’m takin the trash out
Because I’m depressed like constantly
It’s like coo-coo’s nest funk factory
But I got people looking out for me
People who are loyal to the cause and would kill and die for me
And I’d do the same for them of course
It’s Darkside Of The Motherfucking Force!

[Verse 2: Opio]
It’s been a long time but we grew up
Now breack neck’s in the lab doing new cuts
He’s a father now
Just like myself and I’m pulling it through someway, somehow
But It’s all good, there’s no stress man
What you hearing is the words of a blessed man
Shook the load off, got it off my chest man
But I can’t rest ‘till the vinyl’s pressed man
I stand firm cause I gotta’
I knew I had to get a grip and act proper
Been in and out of jail, I don’t wanna go back
But if you giving me threats I’m gonna drop ya
But still I gotta watch my step
Because I lose control when my temper sets
And my family is all I got
And I’m all they got
So I give work a shot instead
Lay the stress to rest and move ahead
No rehab for the buddah heads
We in the groove instead
Continue to shine
Dedicated to kizzo, the beat and the rhyme what!

[Chorus]
I think it’s rolling now
Blast another missile, blast another missile, blast another missile

Combat Rock is in the place to be
We navigate the mothership to the highest degree
Mister K-I-Z is still down with the D
So all you sucker MC’s just let it be! (2x)

J’habite dans un duplex \xc3\xa0 Manhattan au coin de la 73\xc3\xa9me
Jeune cadre dipl\xc3\xb4m\xc3\xa9 mes bureaux sont dans un gratte-ciel
Ce matin de tr\xc3\xa8s bonne humeur je me sens
Nous sommes au mois de Septembre le 11 il me semble
En quittant la maison je laisse ma vie d\xc3\xa9rri\xc3\xa9re moi
Sans m\xc3\xaame le savoir j’embrasse ma fille pour la derni\xc3\xa9re fois
Comme toujours je dis bonjour \xc3\xa0 la femme de m\xc3\xa9nage
En ouvrant mes bureaux du 152\xc3\xa9me \xc3\xa9tages
Je suis le boss celui qui parle au bout de la table j’en suis tout fi\xc3\xa9re
Bref il est 8 heures et bient\xc3\xb4t des pousi\xc3\xa9res
J’ai entendu un bruit impossible \xc3\xa0 d\xc3\xa9crire
En une seconde une secouse des cris des appels aux secours
De la fum\xc3\xa9e dans les yeux et dans le bide
Triste choix: bruler dans le feu ou se jeter dans le vide
Asphyxi\xc3\xa9 j’ai pos\xc3\xa9 mes yeux dans le ciel
Puis j’ai opt\xc3\xa9 pour un vol plan\xc3\xa9 du 152\xc3\xa9me

[Journalistes]
L’apocalypse en dimension r\xc3\xa9elle
Il y aura l’avant et l’apr\xc3\xa9s 11 Septembre 2001
Pas de diff\xc3\xa9rences entre les terroristes et ceux qui les prot\xc3\xa9gent
En ce moment on entend justement au dessus de Kaboul les bombardiers B52 am\xc3\xa9ricain
Ce sont surtout les enfants qui ont besoins de soins
Les habitations ont toutes \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 d\xc3\xa9truites
Et les habitants survivent dans ces amas de ruines

Je viens du pays des cagoules
L\xc3\xa0 o\xc3\xb9 les obus \xc3\xa9claboussent
J’habite Kaboul
Et j’ai douze ans appelez moi Mousse
Les familles sont partis les soldats sont parterre
Le centre ville est en ruine m\xc3\xaame l’\xc3\xa9cole s’est fait bombard\xc3\xa9e
J’ai demand\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa0 Dieu de m’\xc3\xa9pauler
Ce que vous voyez \xc3\xa0 la t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9
Moi je l’ai vu en ouvrant mes volets
Comme tous les jours j’irai d\xc3\xa9blayer les ruines
Comme chaque soirs les \xc3\xa9changes de tirs vont \xc3\xa9clairer mes nuits
J’ai six fr\xc3\xa9res et soeurs j’ai peur que la mort nous s\xc3\xa9parent
C’est difficile alors je prie pour que les missiles nous \xc3\xa9pargnent
Je r\xc3\xaave de l’universit\xc3\xa9 d’un job \xc3\xa0 mi-temps
Ici les gosses pr\xc3\xa9coces deviennent adulte \xc3\xa0 huit ans
Victime d’une guerre dont j’ignore les causes
Des fois je fais du v\xc3\xa9lo mais je slalome entre les corps
Mon p\xc3\xa9re pense que le pays a tous \xc3\xa0 perdre
Esp\xc3\xa9rant comme chacun que la guerre nous foute la paix

La maison blanche, le pr\xc3\xa9sident Bush n’y \xc3\xa9tait pas

Le pr\xc3\xa9sident am\xc3\xa9ricain a jur\xc3\xa9 d\xc3\xa9s hier soir de venger les milliers de victimes
De ces terribles attentats on \xc3\xa9coute George Bush : notre arm\xc3\xa9e
Partout dans le monde est en \xc3\xa9tat d’alerte maximale

Yo je m’appele George je r\xc3\xa9side \xc3\xa0 la maison blanche
J’ai fais la guerre sans motif de temps en temps ma raison flanche
Je suis dans le p\xc3\xa9trin j’ai l’ONU sur les \xc3\xa9paules
Je me regarde en face dans la glace m\xc3\xaame si je tue pour du p\xc3\xa9trole
En v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 j’ai la haine
Je veux le t\xc3\xaate \xc3\xa0 Ben Laden
Je suis fi\xc3\xa9re je mens quand je dis que j’aime la paix
Dans les livres d’histoire j’aurai laisser mon nom
Je suis le pr\xc3\xa9sident Cow Boy d\xc3\xa9clare la guerre plus vite que mon ombre
Je fais croire \xc3\xa0 mon peuple que les barbus veulent frapper l’am\xc3\xa9rique
Pour etre s\xc3\xbbr de taper John Kerry
Je suis le sh\xc3\xa9rif du monde le chef le justicier le commissaire
J’ai un caniche qui s’appele Tony Blair
Je tue des condamn\xc3\xa9s par injection \xc3\xa0 la piquouze
Partout o\xc3\xb9 je passe on me d\xc3\xa9roule un tapis rouge

Lil Boosie bad ass and I wanna know if you a do it again baby girl, you know what I’m talkin bout
if you a press rewind if I ain’t have shit, make a nigga wonder sometime fa real
(ohhh oooohh do it againnnn, do it againnn)

[Verse 1]
Now if I ain’t have shit would she still love, a nigga hair all nappy underarms musty
if I wasn’t boosie bad ass would she still fuck me
tell the truth would me n you ever had an discussion
would you do it again, get away from all your friends
would you still be happy if I ain’t have no bens sometimes I ask myself
would she forgive me for them other kids I had on her long night on the corner all the nights
I jumped on her, chill mama but mama just a little girl
I’m 17 she 15 we having a little girl, she keep it guttah gotta give her dat
she say she tired but if she tired tell me why she ain’t leave yet
never had a job over a week I really spoiled her when we go eat she beyonce and I’m sean carter
if I worked at burger king and approached you smelling like onion rings would she do half the things she done to me

[Chorus]
If I could’ntgive you the finer thangs
the money and the whips and the diamond rings
Would you do it again
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
And if I didn’t have my baller status
And if you didn’t have the 7 ?
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know

[Verse 2]
If she brought me home to her mama
she disagree with her decision
would you wild out if she threatened to put her child out
would she still go get them birds for me slang that syrup for me be at court extra early for me
(sometimes I ask myself) put her on her first plane
told her do her thang took her to emmitt 5 g’s on a pinky ring
if I wasn’t boosie boo would she ride for me
would she had layed down took that pain and have that child for me
she kept it real from the start she ease my brain, was it the chain
was it the game, was it the name
she stayed faithful that’s why I love her through thick n thin
made visits n commisary when I hit that pin
I had my homework she had her homework
she went from drawers to thong work I’m a fool with it
if I worked at mickey d’s and hooked you up with a #3 would you be nice and give your number to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
With all the money I got and all the whips that I buy
if I ain’t have nothing would you still be by my side
if I ain’t have this status no purple just reggie
if I ain’t have no daddy I’d be diggin ?
I’ll still be selling off the store no fresh golds no fresh clothes no bad hoes
sad hoes girl would you still be my hoe
no fendi no prada no gucci can’t buy that would you still lay under me at night time in the projects
no diamond chains from emmit a honda no bentley
would you still go low if I ain’t have this image no sean john cologne no deodorant my odor strong
would I fuck these red bones if I ain’t have my bread long
rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn’t have fuck me
no showers on my grind you prolly wouldn’t have suck’d me
just rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn’t have fuck’d me
no showers on my grind you prolly wouldn’t have suck’d me

[Chorus]

[Chingo Bling]
We in your door, culero
And my nuts gon’ hang

Chorus: Carnival Beats
"Be all in your door cause it’s a southside thang
I’m rollin’ down in my Lincoln
My nuts gon’ hang, I be all
Be all in your door cause it’s a southside thang
I’m rollin’ down in my Lincoln
My nuts gon’ hang, I be all" --> Fat Pat

(Verse 1)
Southeast in Grandeau

Pack big chrome dummy

To Cavalcay
Yeah, these Mexicans gettin’ paid, comin’ down in Escalade, we ball
Spades of braids
Still repin’ Monterey
Valle Hermoso, Taumaulipas, that’s where all my peoples stay (Mexico)
When I hit the script
I see some chicks that I used to hit
Samantha
Tattoo of a panther, I smashed her
Top-drop dancer, fine hoe romancer
She ain’t talkin’ about no money, then
I can’t answer
Hey Nas

Down here, these boys wreckin’ microphones, we abuse it
These ain’t
Hip hop records, this is Country Wreck
Music
You losin’

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Take the mind of Russell Simmons, controversy of E!
Mix it up with Master P, now you purchasin’ me
Who that is, Chingo Blingo, oooh, that the boy out the south
Got the red, white and green bling-bling in his mouth
Like Slim, he do gloss on everything that he floss
And I know the FEDS love to take
Pics of his house
Pudgy putos can’t
Get him, cause
Chingo ain’t
In ‘em, I
22-inch’ spin ‘em, choppin’ boards like a blender
I’m a throw
Hoe-getter, super dope flow spitter
Throw a MySpace party at Toyota Center
This for
All my Mexicans in the pen, gettin’ swole
If they gave y’all parole, I go
Twenty times gold
Cause the Southside holdin’
Northside holdin’
They Can’t Deport Us All
That’s the motherfuckin’ slogan
I’m a rep it real hard
And put it on the Billboard
Green paper, brown face is what I’m in it for

Repeat Chorus Twice

Screens on and neons lit
Grillin’ women and frolicin’

Expensive Taste all on my lip
Breakin’ ‘em off, I’m ridin’ dirty, I’m chunkin’ deuce with the Lil’ Keke
Paul Wall and Chingo Bling, slammin’ trunks like Jailgreen

Jolly dang, it’s why I bling

Repeat Chorus Twice

Wide open. Them leg’s when you bring it to papi

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
That thug Calvin in the house tonight

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse One: Jadakiss)

Yeah alright then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount of flow
Ain’t nothin changed but the range
While I got the inf dot on your head
Take all your scrill
Yeah I’m in it for the green
I get up in your seams, while you sunnin me
Like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your duel cassette runnin me
Wanna get in front of me player, but you can’t get none of me
Better off gunnin me with hot slugs numbin me
Cause you and I both know the flow is comin, b
When you want it, now or later?
I get mijne and slide like a fresh pair of gators
With my mega click involved with Montego bricks
Niggas is mega sick and you know we roll mega thick
Up north, where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it’s back to grams, damn, ain’t that somethin?
All that frontin, what you gonna do? Nothin
So let’s keep things rationalized
Everything I write butta nationalized
I’m into gettin money, twistin honeys
Niggas is buyin Coupes while you on the stoop lookin funny
I’m a scorer, shorty loved the whole aura
Pussy wasn’t all that, that’s why i never call her
It’s all about quick flips and phat mix
Gats with mad clips, TVs in your whips
My style’s tight like Gotti when I cut you
Ceasar Picati or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I’m tryna get the Beamer with the hatch-
Top on for my man, so our shits match
Runnin ‘round all crazy, twistin honeys back
And breakin niggas that come together with small stacks
Really though, screw yah, I never knew yah
Your click be like yellow lights, I’m runnin through yah

(Chorus)

Bad Boy, Bad Boy, whatcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do when we come for you?
You’ll see, heh heh heh heh heh, you’ll see (x2)

(Verse 2: Sheek Lucion)

Hard as it is to make a buck, I ain’t tryna get stuck
So I’ma keep handlin beef like i don’t give a fuck
It’s all about respect, tec-9’s, and papes
Big house in Italy and a yard where honeys crushin grapes
So I get down in my steamroom and give a long prayer
Knowin one day that I’ll be Sheek Lucion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can’t talk shit so the town support this
My staff rollin in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin parades, and holdin rallies for the lifers’ group
So what you gonna do when we come for you?
The same thing you been doin, house brewin
And bubble gum chewin while me and my mans is pursuin
Who you think the latest is in Hampton?
Rockin bansons, while I’m dancin, in the mansion
So cheers to the life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you’ll see how we Lox this

(Chorus)

Bad Boy, Bad Boy, whatcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do when we come for you?
You’ll see, heh heh heh heh heh, you’ll see (x2)

(Verse 3: Notorious BIG)

Niggas talkin it, but ain’t livin it
Crystal pop, I’m sippin it, mob hats and lizard shit
They the chumps bitch
Rollin blunts with the Willy-est of the Willy
Hits like cops, them ones with 9-mili
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitch is wonderin if I’ma fuck with her
She know, I treat my bitches like Ivana
Dolce & Cabana drippin, Big Poppa never slippin
E-class, diamonds, shinin
Dinner with wife, winin and dinin
Smokin cigars in Bogata
With Colombian niggas named Panama and Enrique and shit
Games we play, life endin
Bitches bendin over with ease, for a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karen tank top, I got your bank stock
Singles on top, benjamins under the rest of them
Advancin from duplex to mansion
Stashin keys, hidin g’s overseas
VCR’s in my V’s, game elevate
Money I make into stocks and real estate, bitch
Jet skiin in the Carribean
White sands, discussin plans with my man
Dark blue Land, smoke jet, chrome rims
With a system that leave my rear views tremblin
Whatcha gon do when Poppa ctach your attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it’s a Frank White thing, I stay potent
Bitches devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

[AMG]
Yeah.. whassup y’all?
It’s a 304 thing baby
Snatchin the hoes and the loot..

Smack it up, flip it, fly honey dip it
I never bone alone, I got a nine in chrome
I used to be out of luck, now when I get a boner
it often means vagina miner get to the moaner
I mean really cause it’s silly ? bumps that I broken
I guess you’re gettin dumber ? in the summer
I didn’t know a rap song could make your jock that long
Where’s your mattress, is it strapped off?
I got a girl, now my dick it need a little rest
Can’t be a freak, AIDS killin niggaz every week
So when I see the booty on a cutie
got to turn the other cheek
word to the diggidy diggidy D
So now I got damn groupie on my snoopy
A year ago, now you’re up in the butt
Though I didn’t know, that I would know, so many is good hoes
By the look that you chose, you’re undercover pros
Praise the Lord, bless your soul
In your Gap and your tight clothes and your fake gold
I forgot the hair, gettin paid for your derriere
Shakin it and bakin it, while a nigga steady takin it
for a ride in a Benz or a Beamer
304 have you seen her?  Have you seen her?
AM, pump with the trunk of funk
Won’t luck fuck for a trunk of stuff
Wouldn’t give me the play when I was Jay, now I’m G
She got the okay, she seen my CD (bitch)
And oh how she jocks
Callin in my shit on the Video Jukebox
Baby, I won’t say maybe, I just say noooooooo
Don’t be a 304

\tDon’t be a 304 (4X)
Don’t be a 304
\tDon’t be a 304 (3X)
C’mon baby
What you want my loot and my ducts, and the dingaling?
\tDon’t be a hoe

[AMG]
Now for the deuce, fans wanna know who is who
Tres with the bass, mo’ go 304 is a groupie
Stompin, AMG ain’t from Compton
Better yet Bed-Stuy, N.Y.
Some of ladies wanna know why I say bitch
To get rich or to make a point about a trick
A bitch is a woman who sucks and fucks
a dumb nigga for his duc’s and bucks
A hoe is a girl that’ll do the same
with no shame, and less game
And baby, I don’t want neither
Bitches or hoes, I keep my shit in my Girbauds
or wrap it up tight in a jimmy hat
for a red bombudd and a hootie mack
L.A., home of the one night stand
Like playin craps with your dick in your hand, you understand?
So this is for the college and the high school crew
Cause y’all be out fuckin like a zoo
You better quit, before your dick goes
Fuckin with the trick hoes, don’t be a 304

\tDon’t be a 304 (4X)
Hell yeah, ya know ya know ya know
Don’t be a 304
\tDon’t be a 304 (3X)
Yeah my man, aww yeah
Uhh, uhh, uhh
\tDon’t be a hoe

[AMG]
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww shit
For the ninety-two, peace, to Penthouse
304
My nigga Mo’ Dough
2nd II None, DJ Quik
My man J.C.D.
And Bo$$ is definitely in the motherfuckin house
I’m gone.. peace!
Yeah.. y’all stay tuned
AMG for the ninety-three
You know what I mean?
Aww yeah
Yo, yo Tres, cut me out man, I’m gone

[Verse 1]
A yo the road I travel is full of hard times and hard rhymes
Lost souls with strong minds, Visionaries have gone blind
Politicians that love crime, Missionaries missed the warning signs
On this road I travel, I had the long nights with tears
God whispered to me have no fear
I’m perfecting the path, putting pieces of the puzzle together
You and the rats won’t struggle forever
On this road I travel, I heard the drums bang in the slums
While the hustlers be bangin they guns
And the poor, they just begging for crumbs
Some preachers still begging for funds
Outsiders catch a vibe when they come
On this road I travel, mysteries unravel
Cases get caught by the thunder of the judges gavel
From nine months to nine years
Sometimes my only peace is the pen and the poetry of my peers

[Hook]
Yo it’s like a heat wave
Beats Blaze
We write to the rhythm the street plays
We told you pray for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning
Yo it’s like a sound storm
Crowds swarm
We got them worried from the bury to California
Prayin for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning

[Verse 2]
They call me Raphi shock stopper. Lightning bolt blocker
I’m a grown up. Blown up head bubble popper. Tightrope walker
Not the typical belly flopper in a record pool
I say, "Don’t play doormat!"
Get your back up off the floor and act like it’s your crib
Flip the script and steal the show. Grand theft ad lib
I’m a hybrid wiz kid amid the greats
Shoveling through record crates and I got what it takes
Don’t wanna babble. I want to be the one who educates with class
Speak a lesson quick. Fast enough to give you whiplash
You’re still throwing out that lip trash?
Now you’re about to crash
From cell blocks to bell rocks, my clientele jocks
So ask any one of the many what they thought
There will not be those who left untuned
Some diss, some jock, some listen, some talk
But all of them felt something about the groove
That proves that I’m certified top notch
A West sider knight writer, I ain’t a baywatch

[Hook]
Yo it’s like a heat wave
Beats Blaze
We write to the rhythm the street plays
We told you pray for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning
Yo it’s like a sound storm
Crowds swarm
We got them worried from the bury to California
Prayin for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning

[Verse 3]
I write rhymes to the lights of the city while I’m floating down the freeway
Inhaling dirt through my lungs push auto replay
Words are coming at the speed of sound
Cali quakes when Big Shame and this kid from New Breed’s in town
And the world feel the after shock for all them cats that forgot we make the planet rock
It’s lonely at the top that’s why we came with the clan
We knew from Tunnel Vision that we had the master plan
It seems to me that a responsibility’s on my back
To bring back a respect for this art
So we do it from the heart
That way, a light can shine
Plus, I rhyme to find some kind of divine vent for my rage
This cage-like white rage might seem suitable
Heinous crime for a dangerous mind isn’t do-able
So kid, got a beautiful floweth over my cup
From Mission Park to Cali
Quakin’ forever shakin’ it up

[Chorus: Mighty Casey]
White girlllllllllls, (Suzy,Jen, and Karen)
Going through my miiiiiind, (Sarah, Jesse and Julie, too)
White girlllllllllls, (Judy,Beth, and Sharon)
Help me unwiiiiiiind (The more I see the more I do)
Don’t tell Minister Farrakhan (That’s right)
He don’t wanna know what’s going on (Ok)
Cuz white girllllllllllls, won’t go away..

[Verse 1]
Ticket to ride, white girl highway
Tell all the white girls they can swing my way
What up baby girl how ya doing is you single
Have you ever messed with a light skinned mandingo
And I can give damn, what all my friends say to me
You and me baby can start making up for slavery
Girl I’m just playin I got a white mom
You got any black in you (no), would you like some
O’ word, you like my songs that be playin on tha radio
You know they send tears to a flattery fleratio
I ain’t a pickie guy so I really don’t care
I’ll hit a white chick that got undron hair
Or a ghetto white chick who be trying to act black
With your name on your chain and her hair slicked back
You can be anywhere Maine down to Malibu
From a Trailer park or tha way to park avenue
See me with a black girl you not gon’ comment
Or it might just been a white girl with a tan
And sista’s don’t get mad cause I’m out bangin white chicks
Cause we all look tha same when we turn off the light swicth
See back in the day I was getting no play
Then I went the white girl way like "OJ"
So you can call on "Kato", but I’m sorry "OJ"
Cause I got my white girl and everything is ok

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’ve had rich ones, poor ones, I’ve even had some famous ones
Like "Tracy Lawerence", "Houston", and "Jenna Jameson"
Right about now I’m on probation for three years
Cause I caught a stat case for having sex with
"Britney Spears"
Got head in her dressing room I busted on her chin
Oops (spaooooo), I did it again, "Gwenyth Paltrow"
always saying I be making her laugh, she gave me head
Cause If I hit it I would break her in half
She ain’t even the only white actress on my mattress
I even had sex with that fat chick from "The Pratice"
And "Katie Holmes" always trying to take me home
Callin me on the phone sayin, ‘Casey make me moan’
Smokin weed on the jets again, on a higher plane
Hate country music wanna bang "Shania Twain"
Whether short or tall, whether blonde or brunette
I ain’t met a white girl that I would’nt do yet
And I got "Alyssa Milano" hitting high notes like sopranos
When we all up in my bedroom making some ‘milanoes’
I really don’t think there a girl that I missed
I used to like "Mariah", till I learned she was mixed
For those who gettin furious please don’t take me serious
I’m just wildin’ out like "Eddie Murphy" in "Delirous"
But if you took offense and you black or you white
I glad you did sucka cause you way too up tight

[Chorus]

[Ras Kass]
Son I be skimmin through the billboard top for an R&B; album
Wonderin my outcome
Want the fat triangle but I’m real with or without one
Cause I’ma still sport wrinkles on my new jeans
Smokin beadies to the pink stream
On a microphone, I’m like the booty Michael Corleone 36 zone
The homies always told me to be the man, understand
If niggaz is playin hardball, then why the fuck you throwin underhand
See only the small modest mark time
That’s the reason that bustas still sellin nickel sacks and ganja
You two bit hustla, I’m the grown brother like clockers
Went and give you five cents to put cheese on the whopper
So steer near clear a mere near rear bia
I’m rollin with the crowbar clear
Still wearin my favorite suit like I was asshole naked
Now fake it till you make it or take it nigga

[Hook]

[D.B.A. Flip]
My motions in school going through a whole child
Ya pushin rocks on the block cause the spots what ya found
I made my dough and I made sure I kept my name on tight
Layin low in the day and turn the day by moonlight
They out of sight when they go wild
Just to let them ??? service cluck as they stroll by
Lowkey the smokies on my name
Ain’t no slippin when they crippin cause I done peeped game
Now I had closed, but then they ran me out
I sold my last ounce, then I bounced to my baby mama’s house
Kind of bill couldn’t get no kind of deal
Had to be out on them streets, hurry up and make my sales
But now it’s on cause I’m grown and I’m still a G
But it’s ??? I sell my crack by the tracks in this industry
Remember me when you hustle runnin right do or die on the side flip for life
biatch

[Hook 8x]

[Ras Kass]
Now it’s either give me the money, give me the power
Or give me 4.25 an hour, what the fuck you think I’m gone do
To be honest with you, I gonna get mine
Cause I known niggaz thats college graduates that’s broke
Askin for dimes and nickel sacks
Nigga give me that and I give you some
You watch my back I watch yours
I do rap chores while niggaz be looking for the rapture
I don’t understand cause niggaz gots to capture
Your own, now keep your eyes on the prize
Cause Clinton is peril, nigga you might as well be chimpin
I wanna be eatin jumbo shrimp and lobster
I want 200,000 in the bank, you wanna be the imposter mobster
Recognize like Sam Snead, I got ‘em four twins to feed
So make the next man bleed, I just might
Cause ain’t nothin right in my life
God help me, It ain’t nothin nice

[Hook 4x]
From LA to NY, ATL and back it ain’t nothin nice
To all my niggaz and my bitches throw your motherfuckin hands in the air
And keep ‘em there

Who bring’s it to you
Whoooooohhh

I laid cuts with Jay and rocked rhymes with Run
A couple mil in the bank and I ain’t even done
I got platinum plaques, I write platnum tracks
I got it all from raps and that’s the platinum face, Uh
All that and there ain’t nothing I fear yet
Sippin champagne up in company leer jets
Five star meals, Caribbean vacations
Everything’s plush deluxe accomodations
Nationwide, the stations vibe
To the cat who covers tracks like the lace on thighs
My ace is high, there ain’t gonna be no guessin
And I’m the illest mother fucker on the block no question
I ain’t destined I don’t fuck with fate
Self made millionaire while your bussin plates
You see I’ve already done everything you wanna do
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you

Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who’s your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou
Across the southern plains
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who’s your uncle?

I shot dice with the devil on many occasion
Drank shots with God in an old gas station
A couple accountants, that count my statements
Cribs all paid for, no car payments
Rocked in basements for gas and beer
And now I get all that and big loot to appear
I couldn’t steer so I got me a chauffer
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers
I got over and people showed envy
Cause I couldn’t choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy
Fendi shades and topless maids
I don’t worry about clothes cause thier custom made
I drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years
Your smokin OP’s, drinkin three-two beer
I’ve already done everything you wanna do
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you
Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who’s your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou
Across the southern plains
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who’s your uncle?

Detroit to Texas
Texas to LA
Who brings it to you
Whooooohh
Who’s your uncle?
Brooklyn to the bayou

Verse 1:
Now what would you do if I blast
All up in your shit, mother fuck the whole staff
Niggas non-flow, nine millimeter ?shit than slug?
I’m seeing bloody bodies on the motherfucking rug
6 O’clock be the time, if it’s on, let it be
You see it in my eyes, ?riding boo, hella deep sea?
But you ain’t gone do me like you did the lenchmob
I’m decorated in this game, I played too motherfucking long
Now, I ain’t gotta name nobody name
All I’m knowing is the whole fucking roster is complaining
Talking ‘bout these white boys trying to do promotions
And white bitches trying to get fuck by these soldiers
Fucking wit that slang like you down but now hold on
Seen that ass enough to get your devil ass stoled on
Fucking wit the wrong nigga, playing wit my cash
I’m known for putting devils on they motherfucking back
Blast through the front door, what the fuck, I’m ‘posed to talk
Fuck court, I’ll be a dead nigga ‘fore you walk
Blaow, now the nine had no motherfuckng mercy
So who the sexy nigga, bitch, record label murder

Chorus: (girl sings in background)
Now we feel free to start some shit
Motherfucker shoulda quit
Out for each and every dime, seem like every time
I turn around, some jacky motherfucker trying to take what’s mine
Got the whole fucking clique
Now we fit to start some shit
Got these niggas out the zoo for the job
Bow down or motherfucker you can die when we start robbing

Verse 2:
So many times I’ve seen these niggas fucked up out they chips
‘Cause they didn’t know the game, only making 10 percent
Dealing wit these fucking jews, now you losing everytime
How many platinum niggas standing in the county line
Make you want to get your brick and snatch his ass up out the car
Baby renegotiate, fucking wit them scars
Now you asking who I’m talking ‘bout, homie you could pick
This whole industry got niggas’ shit on whitey dick
And now, since I’m a soldier known to speak my fucking mind
I’ma put you up on game everytime I start to rhyme
Fuck that devil, get your own man, learn about some shit
Or be another broke nigga telling what he did
And now I think you know that I really gives a fuck
???? ‘cause I’m God that the devil try his luck
Last man standing up for the truth, say you heard it
These players getting played homie, record label murder

Chorus

Uh, uhh, yeah.. what?
LOTUG, uhh, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh
From the Q to New Jeru, yeah
Uhh.. hip-hop
Kid Called Roots
Who am I?

[Mr. Funke]
I am a Lord and see, yeah you know me
Brown ass nigga zig-zags from Jersey
When yo’ system knocks, better be Lords on the box
Watch ya spot, we Set It like Vivica Fox
You know I be ridin in eighty-fitty-I wit Sha
while we umm * inhales * on lye
And when it’s trouble, we push the Black Lex bubble
Me and Cappo, push the whip REAL SLOW
Tinted windows, so nobody know
Lord of Undo’, translates to below
Feel the flow, cause we blow like so
Eatin NoDoz, quick to kick like bolo
You know, the way we go, you betta follow
Six-double-oh travel roads that’s narrow
Watch your body, feel it twist like karate
Take dat, feel dat, it’s enough for everybody

[DoItAll]
Check it - a hum dullah don’t deserve to be a star
DoItAll, Lord Jazz, Funk Man, yo who we are - Lords
Immacular, push the black Lex car
Hang you off the balcony -- now my office hours are..
The rap game is full of wannabees who ain’t nice
I get up in it, cook niggaz in a minute like rice
Rock a lot of ice!  Keep the girls lookin at me funny
Tryin to get pregnant, tryin to get some money
But you must be crazy if you think we havin that
I’ve got lawyers that could prove that the Earth’s still flat
Fools wanna stress me, but I can raise the mackin out
Got the Lex off the lot, make the owner back it out
What, L (L), O (O), T-U-G (G)
Livin like kings, gotta push the big Jeep
Take trips to Hong Kong, backstage at a show
with some Chinese broad named -- Sum Dum Hoe -- what?

Chorus: repeat 2X

Take dat, yeah nigga take dat
Feel dat.. "Take that take that take that" -> Puff Daddy

[Mr. Funke]
What the deal is?  You see my jewels be the chillest
I be the illest, me and Lords, back with real shit
Hip shit, Hop shit, freak any topic
Knock it?  Stop it, niggaz didn’t lock this
It’s Resurrection Dun-Dun, frequently let one
BLAOW from the big gun, make the whole crowd run
Ask Sun, come on down and hit me one
Break me off one, come and get some

[DoItAll]
Who wan’ come test, take it to your chest
Put a bullet in your Bubblegoose like Wyclef
Funk Man got these rap cats jealous of me
Like Joe Frazier jealous of Muhammad Ali
But can’t nobody touch this, far as I can see
If you don’t want beef, you gotta give it to me
The Jim Carrey of this rap shit, makin niggaz laugh
at you dirty MC’s, need to go and take a bath, uhh

[Mr. Funke]
Take a seat’n, ain’t no competin
Me and Lord Jizzy, Funk Man ain’t retreatin
Disbelievin, might end all your breathin
Catch me on the weekend, black Jeep creepin
Thug niggaz love niggaz, who bust niggaz
So bust this niggaz, pass the lime liquor
I’m quicker, than your average umm type niggaz
Take dat, take dis, this for you niggaz!

[DoItAll]
Take dat, Put It In Your Mouth like Akinyele
The style that I kick make all MC’s jeally
The bone-crusher, rock the microphone from here to Russia
Leave dents instead of fingerprints when I touch ya
Efficiently declared illegal by the government
Kidnap your mother make you wonder where your brother went
My crew, retaliate like Benny Blanco
Make my getaway, in a stolen White Bronco

Chorus 2X


Verse One:

I can fall from a building and fall from the sky
Make a rapper wanna know why, who’s the fall guy?
A lot of people wanted to know, what I was comin with
The buzz was that the Boy Scout was the shit
Now I got to maintain in my rapper brain
Put a rapper rapper to shame, what’s my effin name?
The Boy Scout, Rampage, still makes the hits
Straight from the Dungeon Shack with the rugged
Don’t even hold me back my brain it start to work
I make, others do the dirt, because the Boy Scout, is the expert
I’m rated six from the new school ford, I’m the microphone lord
Don’t cock block me, and put it on record
Cause you would get gunned down, in a blood bath
Niggaz don’t know the half, the Boy Scout got a craft
Death to all, I’m havin a ball, watchin motherfuckers fall
That’s the way it is when ya bounce the ball
Nuthin but the dog in me, I’m smokin niggaz like a chimney
Me and the Boy Scouts with the remedy
Pull up a chair it’s a world premier, I’m about to bring it here
Just like 2 Black Guyz great, and I’m swift
I be the dope nigga for the nine-four
And I’m kickin down doors, score with a metaphor
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack

With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   

Verse Two:

I’m comin Off the Wall like my name was Michael Jackson
New attraction, I’m showin brothers I got action
Step to the Ramp the Boy Scout is here in nine-four
Wack rappers hit the floor
I know there’s been competition, Ramp and Alge’s on a mission
Plus we got crazy ambition
Now I walk around girls wanna say hi to me
Cause I’m rollin with Busta and the New School society
Some wanna see me cause I’m on another level
Skippedy-dippedy-whip and showin brothers I’m the rebel
Now I’m on the dash that’s gonna last, I’m only fast
Whippin a rapper fuckin ass
He didn’t get enough of the Boy Scout stuff
That’s why he got stuffed, plus his heart pump Cocoa Puffs
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   

With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   

Verse Three:

Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an englishmon
Straight from Brooklyn, Crooklyn
Where I rest, as I’m puttin two to your chest
The Boy Scout man is takin no arrests
Rappers try to hold me about a buck and some change
Now I’m goin midrange, wreckin my brains
Some wanna bite my name just to get fame
You know that fuckin game, yo Bin toss em in the flame
Like the infrared, of the words that I said
Killin rapper niggaz dead, and I’m goin straigh to the head
Another bad creation, ramp is on station
I got my foul MC, to build a bigger nation
I’m droppin hard just like your girl on the Kotex
Like Funkmaster Flex on my brain it’s like Memorex
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   

With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack   
With my knapsack raps and my funky fly tracks
Beware of the rampsack

Half whom, KB, Next Level

No need be uncivil or excuse
Cuz I refuse, the power goes
You know my style
We elevate before my break down my new tal
From Slauson Trail to Oakland
You got it, I’m into smokin’
Driving me there like Martin
Callin my lady
Scoping, looking for K-Borne baby
I’m on the Next Level
Learn from En Vogue
I need Spence like a Chevy
Sees them separate
Stop confusing your feelings
This move we got is cool
Relax, I’m into chillin’

[Next Level]
Now if you think you’re gonna turn my world upside down
By telling me that you don’t care
Or you don’t wanna be around
No I can’t go for that, no way, oh
No, I’m not a fool
Tell me what you want
Cuz I don’t understand what to do

1 -\tI don’t know what to do
\tThinking about you girl
\tAnd it’s driving me crazy
\tWondering if you care
\tSo please won’t you tell me\t
\tWhatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
\tWith my love

Now if you look inside of my heart
Then you will see there is pain
Now I would do anything that you want me to do
Just say you love me, oh

You need a man who can work it out
(Girl I love you so)
And I feel that I can love you without a doubt

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Yeah, I don’t know what to do
You need a man who can work it out
(Girl I love you so)
And I feel that I can love you without a doubt

Repeat 1

[K-Borne]
Stop trying to run game
Ain’t nothing new
It’s all the same
Fornicating in vain
Blinded by fame, forgetting names
Seems strange, I feel it seems
I’m snitchin’ or lies
When it rains it pours
Don’t be jealous cuz I’m fly
Throwing fits but I fit scripts like transfer film
Females scream for this new Don Juan
Sippin’ on Dom, chill
Climbing on drum fields per dollars
Power moving
Your jams on so get your dance on it
And keep it groove

Repeat 1

But see they all the same
Girls use panties
Hoes wear strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
Hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
See playas like me, smoke the weed
And get high, so saucily
Playas like Who? Don’t talk playas that do
Who know how to work the draws
Right off you
She had large backseats, pearl white teeth
She told me it was cool if I felt underneath
The car had beat, situation went sour
I’m not gettin’ close, and its almost been an hour
Girls use panties, pretty in pink
She took em’ off and asked what do you think?
Well preferably, I like a string, but when you wear nothin
It’s all the same
I met girls who are sweet and wear mens boxers
But behind closed doors, they flirt with they doctors
She picked up my package, like UPS
Thinkin’ dirty thoughts in a wedding dress
See girls wear panties and hoes use strings
And some use nothin’ to me they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
And some wear nothin, and lie to they family
He wore tight black gloves
He smoked rope in the tub
He was hard to budge when you called a grudge
Picture him in a seat, wrapped in leather
Smokin in the studio, pullin’ it together
Girls still ask, what makes me tick?
What do I like? And who I hang with?
Blunt on my lip, Nikes on my feet
Hittin’ the hash, rappin’ with Reek
Hoes use strings, soft to the touch
And others wear panties that don’t fuck too much
Some wear nothin, like a model on the run way
But gettin’ dug, from Monday to Sunday
Girls get high, tore, and tangy
Get they hand in yo pocket and try to empty your bank
But Lisa, let me hold your visa
I know you got a man, I just wanna tease ya
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings
Girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
21 years young, its just begun
Catch me at the bar, see how the coke hit me with the rum
Some girls are sweet and some girls are silky
Some got perfect ass and others fat and tacky
Some drive slow, some drive crazy
Some get (?) and tell yo lady
What’s up girl? drinkin’ cream soda
In a tight tennis skirt, like Kournikova
She jumped in the pages, of a magazine
I was at Texaco, pumpin gasoline
She had pulled up, slammin’ $horty the pimp
In a all white car, with an all around tint
She stopped me said I like your Calvin Klein
Said you ain’t seen nothin
Till you see me rhyme
I could tell, by the change in expression
 I was about to reap the benefits
Of my Profession
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin but see they all the same
It’s like hoes use G-strings
Girls use panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they families

Intro:
Niggas can’t hold me back 
We ain’t comin’ for no bullshit
Niggas talking all that yackedy yack, word up

Verse 1:
Here’s to Mrl Keith Murray 
the Mr. Pictionary
The Mr. quicck to fuck shit up in a hurry
ON the mic I’ll squash you little Ms. Philosoophy
With atomic technological atrocity
I find it very ironic that niggas try to rhyme behind me
the supersonic Def Squad MC
Get bird’s eye view
And don’t miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics
Ballistics be twisted like physics (word up) 
Niggas be like how you come up wit this shit
But it’s automatic, I’m inorganic
With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can’t undrstand it,  please
I spark the brain of your G’s
We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final
I got what you need
The most homicidal words to co9me out of a human being
Mind state sick like Idi Amin

Hook:
You can do what ya got to 
And say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game
And let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everday     X2

Verse 2:
Abracadabra talk shit I’ll reach right out and grad ya
The hype got you like gimmy
Don’t let it have ya
I’ll knowck you skeezas pleasers black like Jesus
Never lost in the jungle
Navigators with caesars
Instead dare iz a dark side said by Red
I’m consciously, crusciously coming for your head
I’m from a small coast call stay out my path
And from a big city called foot up in your ass
Jeepers, weepers, peepers get snuffed
By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers
Like fist to cuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it’s my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crimy Reggie, I’m saying 
Fuckwho, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum
Thinkin’ they can see us
We swoop down on crews
Like angels on dust
I’ll leave you mental so broke
You can’t pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I’m itching for a scratch
And somebody to try to match
The battle cat constatly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin’ niggas out without warning
And pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell wastin’ 
Renegades of funk
Like Africa Bambatta and the Zulu Nation
You facin’ a maniac
Pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact I’m L.O.D.ing it and there go planet Def Squad
Puttin’ it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I"m wiring jaws
Got niggas eating full-course meals out of crazy straws
And if it win’t def it ain’t shit
I’m taking it to the limit
And killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peace makers will get causght in the cross fire
Hip Hop’s filled with back stabbers
Blunt grabbers, cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists
Claimin’ to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit
And they’re quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters, rockin’ diamond clusters
Comin’ to stick the rich out you motherfuckers
Educated black man on premises
L.O.D. and Def Squad forever Arch nemesis

.

[Intro: Lord Superb]
Yeah man you know
This right here is that real barbeque music man
Yaknawhatimsayin, That family reunion music man
You know that-that-that-that baby shower music
Yaknawhatimsayin, You get up and dance with Nana Ish man
Yaknawhatimsayin, Grab up on Charlene on Debra
Tell em come on let’s dance, Yaknawhatimsayin
A little reefer, Little liquor
Yall know how we do it

[Lord Superb]
Late night at the table with notebooks
Try to make my dreams real, Get a deal
Hood hate’n on me, They know I’m the one
They see I’m going places and they wanna come
All types of sports car pulling up to the projects
And I aint even put out a project
I had my foot in the door for years now my body in
Hand me a mic and your track I’ll body it
On this one we party’n, Let the shorties in
That’s Jay, Jay that’s Claudia
This is the single, The hook gone make you mingle
Feed lil’ momma champagne till she tingle
I had to dumb it down, I’m coming now
Tell them radio directors son around
To all the DJ’s, Hollar at me
Fifty, Diddy, And Jay, Throw some dollars at me

[Chorus 2X: Convict w/ Lord Superb ad-libs]
They expect for you to make their, Dreams come true
Just keep, Doing what you do
Don’t let them, Change you
Just stay, Honest and true
Cause if they, Knew what you knew
It’s so hard to be The One, The One, The One, The One

[Lord Superb]
Yo I do it for the fans
But it’s bigger then a million records
And all that fake love from haters
Bigger then successes in entertainment, Plus paper
A lot of wack rapper is rich and famous
As for drug dealers, I respect Rich and AZ
See it aint the same the game switched in the 80’s
I waited years for this, Walked tiers and shed tears for this
Dead peers for this
Now I know money talk and bread take care of kids
That’s why Perb flow like he on some Shakespeare shit
They call me Pamper in the hood, I take care shit
With the 5, 6, & 7’s on some day care shit
The money don’t make me, That’s why a lot of niggas hate me
Cause I’m made without it
I did my dirt I played the projects
Now I’m rapping about it it’s only logic

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lord Superb]
Hey, Yo, This is it, This classical music right here
It’s so hard to be The One, The One, The One, The One, The One, The One
The One
I’m the One, What’s the conflict
He want it, Youknowhatimean
Today’s another one, For free baby

.

[Intro-Big Pun]
Fuck is up with the morning show
Big Pun in the morning show that’s all I need to hear
"Big Pun what are you doing Pun" 
Ed Lover, yo

[Big Pun]
Me and my thugs be up in the clubs layin’ the law
While you looking bugged playin the wall 
We’re trying to cave in the floor
Havin’ to ball with the ballers
Terror Squad niggas who want it
Even the biggest dogs acknowledge
Payin how much?  We obviously gain dollars
Let’s mananas without your everyday (?)
We make ballers take cowards of the top give me eight hours
I turn your powder into rocks, check the scenery
Glass table, mad cold Kanedabree, and bring a key
When you hang with me everything is free
It’s my treat, my suite all expenses paid
All my friends can stay, cause this break is on emancipate
Nuthin more, it’s on me butt galore, and head nut your balls
I’m makin money for these fuckin whores
Nice and raw keep it rugged fuck the bullshit
Skribble said it’s all love as long as it’s the new shit

[Chorus](Big Pun)
Must be the music
(Turnin them on)
Must be the new shit
(From Cuban and Pun)
That’s how we do it
(Big Pop is my shit)
Must be the new shit
(They’ll never stop it)

[Cuban Linx]
Yo it’s the lyrical fly guy, that drive by your block in the Benz
I be hittin skins while I’m givin all my friends high fives
I get live and tie your legs to my brass bed
Relax, get comfortable, then hump you through the mattress
Cause at this I’m a professional, the best in the world
That’s why I got so many girls on my testicals
I like em flexible so be able to stretch
And sex gets incredible when the Cuban’s on the set, I bet
I’ll make you sweat like heat my Technics 
Cause we from freak over feet on any day of the week
I keep a hicky, chicks pick me because they love the chinky
I kick a (?), I got them wrapped around my pinky, like Biggie, 
I’m "Unbelievable" this Cubanito keeps a full tank of diesl fuel
Just in case you need to go that extra mile, 
in sex I’m Wilder than Gene 
And in between the sheets, im a show you just what I mean

[Chorus](Big Pun)
Must be the music
(Turnin them on)
Must be the new shit
(From Cuban and Pun)
That’s how we do it
(Big Pop is my shit)
Must be the new shit
(They’ll never stop it)

[Big Pun]
I walk into the fuck-in Tunnel (I ain’t a player)
Bitches on my dick and wan-na dance (C’mon)
I remember when it wasn’t like that (Hold it up Pun)
You call me blimp but now it’s baby fat, must be the music

[Chorus](Big Pun)
Must be the music
(Turnin them on)
Must be the new shit
(From Cuban and Pun)
That’s how we do it
(Big Pop is my shit)
Must be the new shit
(They’ll never stop it)

[2x]
We’ll keep ya hot till the, day light
We’ll keep ya movin all through the night

Verse 1

I arose in mist,by an obelisk, emerge a glowing disc
Many are called but few are chosen to expose the gift
I blow the piff, strategize on how to co exist
With hopelessness thoughts provoking kids with open wrist
Unload the fifth, avoid the callous voice of malice
Destroy the palace,your drinking from a poisoned chalice
Deploy chariots, june brought the food for thought
Subdue your fort with brutal force,marx the cruel sort
And through the path of life,pursue the parasite
With Gruesome apetite consume a human sacrifice
Disaster strikes, like the paragon forces,
They travel on horses ride through babylon fortress
came to inherit,claim a message
Plus they brought the frame of the relic,your name on the death wish
From pain you will perish, finish foe with wicked flow
The hidden scroll turn your inner soul bitter cold

Hook:

And they watch us from a distance
24/7 like they clocking our existance
I plot for the resitance can’t stop the mission
I speak from the heart disregard the opposition

Verse 2

I look at life through disturbed lens
Contemplating how the world ends
Prophets waiting for the hurricanes and whirldwinds
I burn a stem, inner peace I can’t find
Middle eastern landmine wicked beast of mankind
So I recline, they unworthy of attention
losing early worshipping earthly possesion
Learn the lesson,america loves the devil
On june 4th,and so was born another rebel
Seek him out,his thoughts what he speaking bout
He without faith is lost in a sea of doubt
And I remain calm,while they claim hardest
More trees than the amazon rainforest
Trained forces,snakes will reign lawless
Regardless obama or mccain in the office
They all the same, just a different colored puppet
Corrupt the budget, and gain the trust of the public

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus 1]
I’m a pick you up at 3 when you hear me blow my horn, bump bump bump bump bump.....
While we sip on Hennessey hit the speed in the cut would you come come come
would you come come come would you come come come

[Verse 1]
3 double O AM she step into my x-5 beamer
You should have seen her
With a rubber perfection you can put it in a session with Janet Jackson
Little league the chemistry was up to satisfaction
With a magnificent ark spark bringing flame like a arsons
I locked the door and drove off and I drove off kind of slowly
Cause the popo’s always blow me
And this is what she told me, she put her lips to my ear move closely
When we got into traffic she indicated what she working with and put her
lips around my LORD HAVE MERCY
I drove and watch, I watched them grow, I spit my hen, I smoke my dro.. shit
In between conversations she was like....she was like...oohhh oohh ooh oh oh ooohhhh
You already know, she was already blown, she was already gone
She was already sprung gone with her tongue uh huh uh huh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Late at night all alone dream of you in those thongs, girl I wake up in the morning
Gotta have you cause I’m horny
I feel you on top of me, baby girl on top of me
I like the way you moan girl don’t you know you got that humm girl

[Verse 2]
I’m on the phone talking to Mrs. Who
I don’t wanna pump till the bottom white bloom
Tip type game all the things you do
Let her tease me, outta tease you
Baby want to come at 3 AM
She giving me the keys to the new B-M
Plus she giving me and you won’t see him
And she giving me to the you see them
Pick up the phone then arrive at the door
She came out and the white touched the floor
Gotta lay back cause the rain goin pour
Hope for the shade make it one night more
Looking like a diva with the queens on tour
I belong she’s allmo
In the bedroom now its time for sex
Anything goes you can walk like mex
After making love and I will not jet
Up and down and around we go
I can feel her nails when she scream below
I’m a real pimp see I still gotta go
Some get pussy and they still don’t know

[Verse 3]
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (be gone)
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah now throw yo half
Put back on the things you ask
You the man when it’s double dare I’m L I’m L
It really didn’t matter too much to me
If he...didn’t want you to ride with me (mmm)
Why would it matter when you’re his girlfriend (mmm)
But your passing the Hennessey...oh babe

[Chorus 1] (x2)

[Chorus 2]
you might as well braid my hair too.. ohh ahhh

[Kriminul]
By the some of the shit y’all spit, it’s hard to keep
interest in this game
And I know some of y’all don’t like the shit that we spit
we feel the same
See the plan ??? don’t roll with a lot of niggaz just a few friends
And I blast before a nigga even get a chance to put in his two cents
Don’t get me wrong, it’s all love and war
But my fellow black brothers like iced down jewelry in the projects
We attract others, bro for black rubbers
The way I stretch you out, you wanna test me
You be the artist formerly known as alive, so please don’t stress me
Y’all motherfuckers is too sexy, ain’t y’all supposed to be hardcore?
Ain’t y’all supposed to be givin the consumer, what they ask for?
About to tap the plexi-glass ora, along with that glass jaw
Pass the microphone to my nigga Mark like Terry Bradshaw

[Pharaohe Monch]
Spit miraculous shit, drink Dracula’s blood, exist for centuries
My DNA ‘ventually, mends wounds, heals injuries
The identity unknown for obvious extremities
Pharaohe the assassin who was hired to kill Kennedy
The murder of Malcolm X my only aborted assignment
Reduce my molecules then pass through solid confinement
The eclectic, collectively indivisible
Please, your fuckin with the wrong individual
Why would one even combat an entity
In which one is attacked by absorbing your energy
I already peeped your verse before you said it
I scan the wack shit with through the powers of telekenitics

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Uno, Dos, Treise, Quatro
Jigmastas, and company kick the hot flows
So my whole crew is dangerous
Leave ‘em all in a state of flux
And every state we touch
Set fire, and blaze it up
Count it off like
Uno, Dos, Treise, Quatro
Jigmastas, and company spittin’ the hot flows
Dangerous, leave ‘em all in a state of flux

[Talib Kweli]
Most rappers try to keep it real, I go way beyond
My shit is airtight, more Professional than Leon
Phenomenal bird’s-eye view, your shit is comical
My parables be astronomically bombing you
We calmin you down, yo my sound take you back in history
Picture me kickin brown skin lady to black women in Antiquities
Consider me the cat who got rhymes like the clouds got raindrops
I read the book and I been there, what! y’all niggaz just namedrop
Plus, I can pronounce Pharaohe Monch, I know who the hell he is
Funky man or skeletor, I master the universe the Jigs (mastas)
Kid I call your name out, not the alias, but your government
For the love of it, I tear you up and spit you out like doublemint

[Mr. Complex]
I wanna be that fly new boy when the kids crack out on the table the
tape or CD and hear me, shape your minds
Daily I do, and you the tool don’t, front like your special
Special meaning you just don’t got it
Unless you got it and you forgot it
Here’s the refresher, better knowledge, you could challenge your professor
I make kids just give up rappin
Some odd forms of talkin
I frustrate you like tryin to rewind on a auto-reverse walkmen
You look confused like little kids trying to cross busy streets
Is it the beat, is it the rhyme that go you mindin’ mine like business?
The sign of times when the population’s like who is this?
But it’s ‘Plex, I start a craze like sex
I got more styles than cinemas at Sunrise Multiplex

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Uno, dos, treise, quatro
Jigmastas and company spit the hot flows
So my whole crew is dangerous
Leave ‘em all in a state of flux
Every state we touch

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yo, I’m rugged on streets as well as I’m rugged on wax
Your style’s sweet, won’t you do a song with the Rugrats?
I hold shit down for ‘delph, venoms circulate up in em
Funny when I spin em like they in a tu-tu
Sahdeeq rebute you, refuse you like short change
Long range, strokin’ your lady with no stain
My flows aim, dent your chest like Tinman
Shake em apart, send em down the road with no heart
These five here, nothin’ to FUCK with this year
You see through like Sheer, pantyhose spendin’ hoe
Dubbin, analogue and digital flows
Screwin up your cerebral, shit you can’t even conceive bro
Heave-ho, off the steam ship with your weak flow
My style heavy like pebo, Malik cast like devo
The best rest on kilo, now sleep it off stupid
Krim’, Pharaohe, Kweli, Complex, Sahdeeq new shit

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH!
Y’all already know what it is, this is fam
Yo, Brooklyn raise up (come on)
Uptown raise up, Queens
Staten Island, the Boogie Down

[Chorus: Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Aiyyo some people die for it (And some live it)
Some people snatch what they can (And some give it)
It’s not how you play the game (It’s how much you win)
Fuck the wages of sin, we gon’ hustle
(We don’t get by) We multiply
(We don’t settle for less) We take the whole pie
(Don’t gamble, we invest) Cause the stakes is high
(Whether we live or we die, we gon’ hustle)

[Talib Kweli]
You all comfy when shit is paid up, like the car note or your rent
Look out you broke, and now you got more Hustle than Larry Flynt
Diggin up dirt on politicians when you got no pot to piss in
Sellin watches for commission, with fake rocks that don’t glistin
Holdin up a block position, been a lot of options,
for you to get in, stop the bitchin!
You just ain’t makin no hot decisions - where the blood clot?
Look how many gold-diggers the clubs got
If you ain’t up on the hustle, find yourself doin the bus-stop,
or the train station, with the change, waitin for a metro card
Petrified, cuz once you get the dough to let go is hard
I’m a vet though and it’s odd to see these new cats splurgin
Industry virgins think money make ‘em a better person
Sign to ya mans label, which is under a label, under a parent label,
apparently you ain’t even able to sit down at the table
You ain’t braggin about seein the dough,
You braggin about bein a ho
Don’t be mad at me, be mad at’cha boys,
I just thought you needed to know

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they try to gas me up (gas me up)
But I don’t fall for the flattery
Just keep the people charged like assault with a battery
Now your mad at me, and your squad wanna battle me
Cuz every line I spit, got a money-back guarantee
With a lifetime warranty, just keep the receipt
Universe is passing moments, but my world is the street
They can’t dance and when they hustle, they trip over they feet
They tryna make ends meet like when they cipher complete
I used to wanna be a star when I was a spectator
So now I’m legendary, when I die I’ll be greater
It’s funny how life is just like an elevator
But major life changes ain’t nuttin to be afraid of
Remember (-member) nuttin in this life come free
Cuz if I take from you, somebody else gon’ take it from me
And I’ll be damned if I let somebody take it from me
Shit I’ma do for y’all the way you never did it for me
Come on

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Up in the city that never sleeps, black mommas forever weep,
and cats whip Jeeps equipped with fashion designer leather seats
But the team is never beat, and we always weather the heat
Stay with that mentality, I’ll bet y’all niggas never eat

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Yo, they callin me the Devil’s Advocate,
but they don’t know the half of it
The lone catalyst, shaped for my master shit
Make it tangible, firmin up the hand of these apes
Who can’t grasp because intense, so they rewindin my tapes
Yo Kweli!

[Talib Kweli]
We count down to armageddon like 1, 2, 3, 4
We raw like C4, been here before and after
You up and down like a see-saw,
With your fake hustle, that beats more
Like when I ask my three year old son to make muscles

[Mr. Khaliyl]
Cuz muscles come in all shapes, and mine take the form of breath
So when I spit the air is thick enough to beat you to death
See to die is to have lived, but you can’t even die right
You like a candle on the sun, nigga you just a waste of light

[Chorus]

[Mr. Khaliyl (Talib Kweli)]
Come on eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
(It’s like, it’s like, it’s like)
Come on, come on, come on (Uh, uh, uh, it’ like)
Yea yea yea yea yea yea (Yo, it’s like, uh)
Yea yea yea (Come on it’s like)
Raw Series, Mr. Man (Come on, it’s like)
(Yo, yo, it’s like)
Kweli, Reflect ‘Ternal
(Y’all wanna get a peice) C-Smith
Rawkus Records, Raw Series Entertainment
Make it nice like that for you..

[Intro: Kwajo Cinqo]
All my peoples...
Projects...
Worldwide...
Yeah...
One love...

[Ray Smoove]
Remember back in the days
One man chased round the way
Used to do runs for them bigger cats for chump change
Now times change
Who woulda knew
How we grew
To become them same thugs on the avenue
Now I’m talking to your spirit
Wondering if you hear it
Problem you seeing my presence in a minute
You gone but we still living
Still strong and wishing you were hear to see it
We clicked not even death can part it
My people asking where my heart is
I left it with you
Now I’m heartless, and moving heartless
You dearly departed never forgotten
You taught us about street life, that’s why we still chopping
Thats why we still poppin them collars
Fiendin for dollars
Until it’s my momma that hollas
That sad song
It’s been mad long
Hoping that life prolongs
But when the breath is gone, then the breath is gone

[Chorus]
Staring at the walls in this room
Knowing that you left the world far to soon
And it ain’t fair, no, and it ain’t right
I tip my drink and shed a tear tonight (shed a tear tonight)
To anyone who’s lost someone
This goes out to you knowing that the time will come
Where ever you are whatever history
To those gone before us rest in peace

[Angel Duss]
Poor a little henny for my dead people resting in peace
Got real G’s dying in a fleets
It’s the code of the streets where your life ain’t guaranteed
I’m tired of hearing my brother’s dying every week (Oh lord, oh no)
This petty beef ain’t worth it
They got kids knowing it just ain’t worth it (ain’t worth it)
Doing life bids locked up with no purpose to live
My man Big’s got two in his head
Now little Reg the same since he’s on his death bed
Memories of the past days
The good ol days
When gats used to blow at your rivals not your homies (Shed a tear tonight)

[Chorus]

[Dolo]
Picture every single day living in my hood
Thugs up to no good (no good)
We all grew up as one blood
Too many filled up with slugs
Streets got no love (no love, no love)
I been to more funerals this year, threw dirt
Remember when we used to play in the dirt
Now I’m throwing dirt, on a golden casket
I seen my fate, at the open casket
I’ve seen thugs cry, when you got blasted
6 O’clock news, front page plastered
Now all we got is memories
While I’m wishing you was right here
We used to wear the same gear
Now I’m shedding tears
I see you when I get there
Look against the concrete
But your spirit is here
Strait from the heart you’ll forever be a part
Of these dogs from the hood, and that’s only a part

[Chorus]

[Kwajo Cinqo]
A love like no other, like the love for a brother
Like the love that you show one another
I would give my life
People re-embrace the seeds of mother
And I still see a resemblance of her
Do you remember the timing
I would change the four dogs on assignment
Four bricks, one block, all fiends in the lobby
When the epidemic hit and the city was silent
How we made the most noise when they hit our apartment
Then school for the reefer and jewels, then sneak into flicks
Anything for them chips, we would settle with fists
See I was young and hard headed, never settled for ish
Till the last breath left your lips
I had to settle with the fact you were one with the ground
Most times I took you for the reasons I frowned
See yo seeds is my seeds, and the future ain’t sound
Till we make a difference this time around
So live through me

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Now how you do it baby do it [x2] yea yea yea
Now how you do it baby do it [x3] woa a woah

Girl your my everything, my everything

last night I should have died
to the hand of a best friend...

he held a gun that was mine
and said we’d meet some women in a hotel
and left me there to die

he stopped by my mothers house on his way home
cried with her for an hour
and left some money for my funeral

he held my moms tight
and said god bless his soul
but guess what?
I didn’t die

I guess you didn’t expect to see me so soon
pleading my absence to the dark side of the moon
what about everything I helped you through?
fuck that
we were deeper more just like brothers
you left me suffering in a hotel room
bleeding and unconscious excepting that I met my doom
and still you turned and I remember you
the tears they burn
there’s no forgiving you
I loved you like my own blood
trusted you in my home
was that not enough?
I know that times were rough
but only together could we stay tough
back to back is how we bust
I remember when we were seventeen
cornered in an alley way
I sacrificed my parents van
just to help us get away
we almost died that day
I’d give my life I’d say
but for some money that we could have split
you ride me
and with some honeys major hit
but like always
didn’t unload the clip
it was your woman that helped me place this bid
pick up your face you bitch
your lucky that you have kids
or I would fill you up with this lead
while I was pistol whipping his head
you stupid fool
kill me you tried to prize from my demise
now look who’s in your eyes
now look who’s getting what
its over!
never again
never again
you lost your one friend
your only brother
motherfucker
you know this rage came over me
you know this rage came over me

[Chorus]
Ride my bike girl tell me how it feels(What)[x2]
Seal it with a sex lil mamma wats the deal
Deal[x2]

[Young Stunna]
Young Stunna Fo Life
It’s Stunna Man
Young Stunna man I’m coola than the weatha
I hop over the cloud and stay in the cool weatha
She can love her man but it’s obvious I’m betta
Super soaks in my pants ay man I wet her
Fly got cheddar
400 dollar sweaters
Superior to the lames cause my words play clever
Vans or leather I’m a skatepunk shredder
Ashley and Michelle I call it a double header
Hella fucking icy there’s nothing I could get her
Mouth like snow turn summer into winter
She got to be slindder fast like a blender
I’m a just bend her
I’m going to december
Big car loss hit the all star
Fucking like a pornstar now I’m in the new car
Go hard, I got a go kart
And you betta handcuff cause I’ll smash your hoes hard

[Chorus]

[Young L]
Call Darksmith tell me how it feel
You see the peadle on the wheel
Ride L’s bike no training wheels
Na Na it’s time for a cavity search
You been a freak since birth
Show me wat it’s worth
Soft like nerf take the booty from the turf
No rip the slippas
Just bop the boots
Young L got a chain like fruity loops
Take yo chick to the back make her hoo la hoop
Remember ice cream gimme that super scoop
What I’m saying ma I ride my bike
Jive, Zomba, Up All Night
Club, tele, fuck all night
It’s skateboard L
I spit on mice
I spit at dikes I don’t care

Take off your underwear
Keep talkin bout trains na don’t care

[Chorus]

[Lil B]

[Verse One] [Kanye West]
Ayo, rippin’ you niggas is the easiest
Y’all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine they the greesiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold ‘em
Know when to fold ‘em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin’
Holdin’ your gun, especially if you owe ‘em
Watchin’ yo back, especially in the mornin’
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, "Be safe."
Like you carryin’ a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you’re all paranoid like, "Is this shit laced?"
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure
My point is mainly that
We maniacs 
Maniacs nigga what

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
Nothin’ nice when you fightin’ for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him?
Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (naw)
Ask ‘em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine?
If I see him on the street, I’ma blast him maine
Have a ? and a ? in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
I told ‘em, "Slow up. This wasn’t even about you maine."
He must of thought I was scared though
Unprepared though
Oh no
Here come my guys hoppin’ out the Volvo
Fo’ fo’ out in the clear
One shot hit ‘em in the ear
Open the trunk, put ‘em in here
What it is stick? Put it in gear
You need to know you can’t fuck with my blood
We
Throw you in the trunk
Get you drugged
Take you to your own grave
That’s the shit you dug
Now it take at least six niggas to pick you up
C’mon

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse Three] [Rhymefest]
Got my money and my loot now
Tell the truth now
Don’t make me grab the .380
Don’t wanna shoot ya
You got a little girl? 
Think about her future
You need an outfit
These slugs should suit ya
Like 5-0 my nigga, I hot pursuit ya
Bullets trimmin’ the side of your head like crew cut
Used to be po’
Never could afford new stuff
Even so
We grabbed ski masks to do stuff
All on ten
Niggas was high and juiced up
While you livin’ with your girlfriend like a moocher
Get your own shit, be about grown shit
When the chrome spit, you can hear a bone split
I don’t give a fuck ‘bout who you gon’ get
After you dead, killin’ him is just a bonus
Ding ding ding
You my millionth customer
Yo K? Why these niggas always think they can fuck with us

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don’t let ‘em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

Down down 
Down down

Rodeo drive money old as Clive Davis

Dark tints rims chalk like razors
Two mill to the side for the cases

Moskowitz wanna lean on a man
Peter Pan got exed out the plans
Lil\xc2\x92 homie still be movin like the feds

Pretty face and she got the fattest culo
Kissin all on me, pinchin all on me
Touch a lil\xc2\x92 paper start switchin all on me

Outkast, they feel my shit
Dave Banner, he feel my shit
E-40, he love my shit
And all the others say (yeah!), "blood can spit"

[Verse 1 - Casual]
Buh uh, ladies and gents, the Mercedes, the Benz
I get 80 percent of a major event
Better go, better go let it go, I set it for yo, pathetic flow
You don’t know what you headed for (huh!)
From no riches to breaking down blunts with bitches
And funny niggas still act like they want the business
While you better make a run for the gun store
You know me as god’s child setting your soul free
The poverty stricken, Wallabee kicking, top quality spitting
Make them all holler "he hitting" (huh!)
I get lustful over the knowledge I desire so
I expect of my women what a college may require
Well-trained (huh!) Impalas by the fire
So when I come around, acknowledge that I’m fly-er (huh!)
I’m the west coast rapper with the best flow
And who gon’ protest that? I’m too fresh

[Chorus 2 - Casual]
Self Scientific, them niggas feel my shit
Slum Village, them niggas love my shit
Keek the Sneak, the nigga love my shit

[Verse 2 - Casual]
That a way! in Manhattan at a matinee
Michigan, with a chick again, Alize
Let’s go to Mexico, checks to blow
Off that, very special, the extra o
We off to Miami, with my family
And I give you the business while sipping the privelage
Then scoop to East Oakland where all my niggas hear me
Light green smoke then sipping on remy
It’s on me, cash, and Dame Dash
Sipping on army with bitches on Harleys
Or esaurito with my good friend del
And all we ever drink is white zinfindel
Now check it out

[Chorus 3]
Niggas feelin’ my shit

Yeah, Street Smartz, Stretch Armstrong
97, Fuc That representin BK, QU
One time, check it
Yo, yo
  
Niggas your rhymes be soundin short
I take your whole town to court
Plus my 4-pound support when I hold down the fort
F.T. is a spiritual feeler
Lyrical thriller
My material’s iller than the brain of a serial killer
You get your block slaughtered by the glock sporter
Quick to fuck a cop’s daughter
Then drown her in hot water
Illuminatti ain’t have nuttin to do with Gotti
Through trees I blew a shotty through the body of Juliany
I wanna bann ‘em 
Governments I can’t stand ‘em
I used to catch tambertentials
When I heard a national anthem
F gets hysterically
Thinkin of killin
But don’t got the stability, ability or artillery
Fuc That is a fly name
I can feel a high strain
In my brain I catch live pains to give me migraines
It takes a lot of examination and understandination
Consume much animation is contamination
  
Yeah, NYC, BK, QU
Uptown, Boogie-Down, Staten-Isle, Strong-Isle
Yo, Yo, Yo
  
Why always gotta worry about shots fillin me
Cops killin me, hostility and hammer
The hospital be wooby
These streets is too evil
Tools from more than a few people who shoot needles
Drug abusin in slumbs
Look at Pop Dukes’ beautiful sons
Son packin an, usual gun for mutual funds
All I want is monopoly
Cops ain’t possibly stoppin me
Properly and niggas is probably thinkin of robbin me
In this jungle it’s hard to see these elderly people...

[Chorus: Drake]
I’m still fly I’m sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I’m still pullin’ out the phantom and these haters can’t stand em
Nigga I’m still doin my thing
I’m still fly I’m sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I’m still shuttin’ cities down every time I come around
Nigga I’m still doin’ my thing
I’m still...

[Page]
Clean in this bitch I’m feelin’ myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I’m flyer then an invitation
Like I’m the information
Toronto’s been waiting and I’m glad ya’ll been waiting patient
But I’m here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that’s just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon’ drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when’s that gon’ stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin’ damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you’ll probably see him

[Chorus]

[Page]
Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
S 550 navigatin’ where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don’t forget the E.
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting’ checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don’t really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin’ still a hobby and I do that with ease
I’m bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I’m in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I’m the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I’m fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky

[Chorus]

[Lady Luck]
Yo!
Yo, yo, yo, come on
Yo, yo, yo, come on
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse 1: Lady Luck]
Yo, yo, yo
You could get rugged, rough, hard like luck
Bring your best rhymes and you niggas still suck
I’m slumped in a truck, with the pump tucked
Come to bend some dough? Never give em love
Your money like old men, can’t get it up
I’m spittin up, sick of stuff, middle fingers up
Luck, never give y’all respect
Like no hot card check pounds with the left (What up, my)
If you get offended, I’m talkin to you
Come get it, and there’ll be a coffin for you
You done did it, you messin with Luck, you pressin your luck
Got locked in jewels and I ain’t givin em up

[Chorus: Redman]
(Come get it) Y’all niggas wanna fuck wit Jers’
(Come get it) Tha Bricks don’t fuck wit her
(Come get it) I represent Jers’ till I die
Smoke on the la la la, la, la, la
[Lady Luck] (Redman)
(Come get it) Y’all niggas don’t want it wit Jers’
(Come get it) Luck don’t come wit hers
(Come get It) I represent Jers’ till I die
smoke on the la la la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, yo yo, Funk Doc
Smack y’all niggas, jack y’all niggas
Have ya thug as thug come get it back for y’all niggas
Laugh at y’all niggas, throw caps at y’all niggas
Stick NBA for the basketball figgas
Gigolow, live with two hoes, John Ritter
Arm litter (bling!), microphone tormenter
I’m hungry as FUCK and I came to eat
If you came to shoot Doc, can you aim at least?
Bricks, sucker MCs that stay hookin up
You bougie hoes like, That’s What I’m Looking For
Do, your moms think I’m a hell of a guy
Pussy, you don’t get it like American Pie
I scar deep wounds, bubble teaspoons
Powder is the ?, yeah, bottle is the mind
When I spit, y’all become fiends to me
Crack costs MONEY, but the fee is free

[Chorus]

[Lady Luck](Redman)
(Aiyyo, low
Do you really know what pressure is?)
Nigga I apply it
The one scannin TVs in the Rodney King riot
Guns, all solids; whips, no milage
At the bar, three iced teas, Long Island
I stay stylin’, boo stay fair with weed
In the V lane, 3 switchin’ up with speed
I’ma be obnoxious until I can’t, breathe
And until, then, y’all can’t, win
Luck’s 12 on a scale from 1 to 10
And blew a spiral hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up! Damn, I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that’ll rock ya chin
And pop ya lids, handle like Iverson
The Mulberry, flows extraordinary
How ‘bout the go Chevy a hole in the 4 steady
Been wantin’ war let me know when y’alls ready

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
You don’t have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
Let the punks know

[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
Guess it’s this felonies hobby
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long
Teflon protects my body
It’s such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I’m caught in
Supportin’ me
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie
Secrets to war licks, and score shit shared
Between clients and homies
Remember what Pacino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phoney
I get that cash, stay lonely
And I’m on point like a thorn
And it’s survival of the strong
Livin’ outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
I’m on a twelve o’clock cruise to Brooklyn
And I’m lookin’ for the third
Let’s see no barrel ready to get his life tookin
So where yo killas at and fetti
Trick don’t test me to leave yo coward ass stripped
And a full clip empty in yo stomach
Choosin all
Yeah nigga runnin’
Poppin’ all you cowards that be jockin’ a nigga behind you
You done just about made it on impossible to escape
Another emergency visit to the hospital
I can’t wait to meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards bleedin in yo fuckin’seats
When we hit ‘em up

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle
Sneakin through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit
Get me free to let my ice click
Ka-pling, ka-plow
I been a thug shootin slugs since a child
And still wild

[2Pac]
You don’t have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes

* send corrections to the typist

[Hook: repeat 4X]
We got big bank, big rank
walkin through the club like my shit don’t stank

[Verse One]
Remember back in the day we used to sport fox
Izod alligator shirt with the socks
Louie Vuitton, I used to rock it like farm
Gucci with the tag, not painted on
Now them days done gone, and shit done changed
I went from a bronco to a six range
Nawmakazel, now it’s Cartier frames
Light weight chains, princess cuts mang
Chedda like velvetta, i’m in the club
V.I.P, with a black heata
Thug drama, smokin on blue sticky
They see me ballin in this game
and they wanna hit me. (Cog-nonsense)
Lets go, giocanna eyes low
Two-way E, tell ‘em to meet us at Roscoes
Ball til I Fall, thats my motto
In LA, NY even in Flo
Sittin on ‘tractin rims
wit’ a mexican, took X again
want sex again
Jot it down, it was told to me
by that boy, A.K.A. The P-O-E

[Hook] - 4X

[Verse Two]
Deep in ya brain, the nigga you cant stand
Most get upset when I switch cris hands
Shoulda left band, it gets worser man
Ice so bright, you salute both hands. (switzin’)
To the dot 6 we ride, got two chicks that promise to say Ahh
We’ll pop a X and swallow between thighs
Yall get it right, while I chase the sky
Been here, been bubblin’ like coke pots
Boy, I cant stop
Bentley, Lex or a drop top
The fo’ on, ?? soft leather til pop
Lyrically man, niggas to the turf like cops. (goddamn)
Little mama got class, absolutely, Gucci dime ass
Oooh, I wanna hit it from the back til ya cry
Cognito, you the best I wont lieeee
V.I.P, you know me, mob related
Toast style like Kool & the gang, celebratin’
Guns stay cocked, why not? It’s real life
Cause playin’ in this game you lose your real life

[Hook] - 4X

[Verse Three]
Aint it a shame the way the ferrari vibrate the body
Collectin mo’ chips than laser sex parties
Me, I, be with the P-O-E
Til I’m calm, restin the box with crossed arms
The beat double, look around where you say it cause
its like trouble
Who’s watchin? My man Ricky Ross
Six-six giocanna, twelve and don’t test the calico wrist
Cant forget E-class, sniper-like
Even if peripheral view, you lose sight
With so much ice, we turn night into day
We too fly, in front of the Source awards
Red Eyeeeee

[Hook] 6X

Walkin through the club, like my shit don’t stank

[Travie McCoy]
Yeah, it’s Travie. Aha
Taio. Haha.
Let’s go.
Now I’ve never been one to dance
But we’ve got something going on in my pants
It’s like I’m stuck in a trance and I’d better take advantage
Who knows when I’ll get another chance
I feel like Breakin’ 2
Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly, I’ll be O-zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz

[Taio Cruz]
Now I know I’m gun’ get down on the floor
Experiencing what you can’t ignore
But something bout this beat just got me hooked
Come over here and take a closer look

[Pre-Chorus]
Coz I can’t get enough, I can’t get enough
I can’t stay on the ground (woah)
I can’t get enough, I can’t get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
(Let’s go!)
It’s taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
[repeat]

[Taio Cruz]
I do this for,
Its just for the thrill,
I got this high, were bout to get a feel
This move has got me way over the sun
I’m dancing like I am the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Coz I can’t get enough, I cant get enough
I can’t stay on the ground (woah)
I can’t get enough, I can’t get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
(Let’s go!)
Its taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
[repeat]

[Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air, and my head on the ground
And the rest of body’s somewhere in the clouds
I’m coming down, no time soon
Like I’m tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like imma be up for a minute
Uh huh, such a beautiful feeling, didn’t it?
Yup, where your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite

[Bridge]
The musics got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

[Chorus]
It’s taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
[repeat 4x]

[Outro]
It’s your boy Travie McCoy!
Taio Cruz!

Turn my mic up son
Turn my mic up son
Y’all niggas ain’t ready

Yo yo, E, how’s the kite
Rippin’ the mic, hardcore, keepin’ it tight
Sho nuff, roll thick, come, my squad be tough
And I take no shit cuz I had enough
Who makes the dough, don’t act like y’all don’t know
Got things y’all cats never seen before
Ask your hoe, the E go cash to blow
Get it, spend it, with it, fast or slow
Where my dogs at *growls*, hold it down
At the 5-5-9 of the underground (What, what)
Hate me I don’t care
Cuz I been figured out that life ain’t fair
So I’m doin’ it on my own
If I need some help, I’ll call Tyrone (Say word, word)
Def Squad, makin’ ends
Next year comes ‘round, gon’ do it again

Y’all niggas ain’t ready (4x)
\tTurn my mic up some (4x)

Yo, when the sun goes down here comes the moon
Doc let the wolf out, tear the roof out
Def Squad general bring your whole account
I got it in the couch, we can brawl
I clock the squeal, make your block feel
Like hot mills on your chest when the cock still
You know, wavin’ the fo’ with big
Do you know when you fall like bowling pins, huh
Yo, let my dog loose *growls*
You can’t unloose if I came full proof
Worldwide tear, ???
Dope shit, I’m surprised how I do that there
D-O M-O, it’s to put the slug nose to your CEO, then blow
If it gets thick, I doubt it
Long as Def Squad be about it, clubs stay crowded

Y’all niggas ain’t ready (4x)
\tTurn my mic up some (4x)

Yo, how come anonymously, I ka-pow
Rock the rough crowd, me, Reggie, Biggie E and the ???
Smokin’ in the streets covered by black clouds
Hard to the core, with the pow and the wow
Take it to the streets like a thug sippin’ sud
Show ‘em some love before they rip up the club
Catalistic, disaster, catastrophic
Superistic, super-charged, MCs at large
Definition of tradition, before description
Make a nigga go broke, can’t pay attention, listen
We built this empire on rap alone
When the battle and the war, never get the throne

Y’all niggas ain’t ready (4x)

You’re listening to the sounds of WDEF Radio, Def Squad Radio
Where Nasty Nudge, the big mouth
Still in charge and still fuckin’ your man while you bitches ain’t around
Y’all niggas ain’t ready

Well now you say you wanna be loving me
But back in the day I wasn’t good enough for ya
You wanna sleep with me
Back in the day I wasn’t good to love for ya

You don’t know about loyalty
You don’t know how to make a girl feel like royalty
You don’t know about conversation
All you seem to be is a complication

Here you go again boy, stressin’ me out
I ain’t got no time for no messin’ about
Boy, your game is over
You’re a casonova

Well now you say you wanna be loving me
But back in the day I wasn’t good enough for ya
You wanna sleep with me
Back in the day I wasn’t good to love for ya

You don’t know about loving me
Talk too much and I guess you don’t know boy what love means

Here you go again boy, stressin’ me out
I ain’t got no time for no messin’ about
Boy, your game is over
You’re a casonova

Well now you say you wanna be loving me
But back in the day I wasn’t good enough for ya
You wanna sleep with me
Back in the day I wasn’t good to love for ya

Shame on you boy
But if I take you back
It’s shame on me...

[Izzy Ice]
Once upon a time in the streets of the ghetto
Lived a little old lady with the grand baby hello
It’s me, here I am, where I am, there I am
Never knew that soon I was to be the man that I am
I wrote rhymes with my cart and a cap
In junior high, indeed he became Super Fly
Went into high school, soon it became my school
The girls would sweat but couldn’t get me so I drooled
Cause I’m the Golden Child and I have a golden
Stylistic, ??? mystic I’m sophistic with the style
Writing rhymes every day so I could battle
The bums, making em run like cattle, cause down so I can elaborate
On who I am to be in the future
??? has seen more pipes than Roto-Rooter
You get smoked like Camels til you shine like enamel
Leave your head spinning like Dorothy Hamill
Ask the panel, they hide under flannel cause this man will
Dismantle a crew at a candle or two, for Mr. All That

Each verse I construct is a bomb
I’m as calm as Vietnam, my rhymes are fat as Dom
Delauise, oh ??? I wanna kick it
Don’t wanna wait to the Midnight Hour to kick it like Wilson Pickett
Cause I sweats no one, oh did you realize
But I have more moves than a shogun
Warrior, I’m sorry you didn’t understand
Younger man as I result I’m flooring ya
My rhymes hit like a car crash
Stand clear when the man’s here, with your lard ass
With my Jordache, who gets more cash?
I’m large as an oak tree, you wanna approach me?
Now isn’t that cuuuuute!
Not really, I’m sleeping on your rhymes like a silly
Pasta peanut can rock the beat is essential
I make so much music my acapellas are instrumentals
And could you please shut your jawing
Or as your leaving could you please shut that door behind you?
And don’t come back
Unless you’re ready to be trashed by Mr. All That

Now "Mr. All That" is just a title that I’ve earned
We can reconcile after for the fact cause I be wrecking while speaking
So don’t try to distinguish my language
Cause since you’re just a sandwich, I’d rather eat a Manwich
Or a meal, I think it’s time to peel
Cause I heard it through the grapevine
That someone tried to take my reel-to-reel
I got the hand that rocks the cradle, that’s my label it’s fatal
You don’t belive me? Well wait a little bit
So I can do it at my own pace
Hey there’s so little comp I gotta climb up in my own face
Now isn’t that a shame that I man I call Dames
A lame people give him credit but that’s game
My rhymes have thiacin, nutrients also vitamins
Protiens, carbohydrates, I can’t forget the niacins
Take a dosage of my rhymes if you’re weary
If you’re sick just sit and I’ll pull out my dic-
-tionary, cause I forgot the name of the medicine
I usually have an MC a la king with lettuce and
Tomatos and potatoes on the side but it gets me fat
And you gotta be swift to be Mister Aaaaaaallll That

And you don’t stop, keep off

[Creo-D]
Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies

Chorus: Creo-D
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
Everybody
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on

[Verse 1: Creo-D]
Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin’ on
Lookin’ all nice and sweet

Yo, girls that be lookin’ real cute
The way y’all kickin’ them Daisy Dukes

Come on, baby

Repeat Chorus

[Tony Mercedes]
"YEAH, just hit me" --> Afrika Bambattaa

[Verse 2: La Sno]
Hey, you, in the black boots
Knee, highs, with the Daisy Dukes
Lookin’ real fly while in cahoots
In the park, where I can do you
I’m La Sno, here to relate to you
How I started the trend of them Daisy Dukes
Ever since, the summer of the 90’s
Girls lookin’ good, with their future behind, see
Many terms are used to express
We’re talkin’ ‘bout the booty, not the breast
Baby got back, the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo
Please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big ol’ booties
Where I’m from, they call ‘em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks, hangin’ from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it, got it good, just dip the dug out
Them damn Daisy Dukes are turnin’ ‘er out
Say

[Creo-D]
Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies

Repeat Chorus

[Tony Mercedes]
"YEAH, just hit me"

[Verse 3: Creo-D]
Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin’ on
Yeah, they be kickin’ it sweet
With them long ol’ boots on feet
And check out the way they step
Make your brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they’re tan, drive off red
It don’t mean what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin’ those legs in lily white
So it won’t make one difference on you
As long as you’re kickin’ them Daisy Dukes

[Creo-D]
Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies

Repeat Chorus

[Tony Mercedes]
"YEAH, just hit me"
"Hold it now"
"Wait a minute"

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

If you were them, you’d best prepare for combat
Gon’ be a long one, best to bring the bomb sack
These so-called players ain’t real no mo’
Snitch-hatin hustle and still we kill for dough
Real for sho’, I’m knowin that they phoney and faulty
Just lice on my balls, I cut em up off me
Now these jealous muthafuckas want me, ain’t that a bitch
Like I’m a punk and you could play me out, you fuckin trick
Must be suckin on a glass dick
I’m smokin weed, drinkin O.E. like ‘86, raise the dick
Can you see me bout some major shit or is you minus?
Small timers with a bitch-made click of co-signers
Not a rider withcha, think you’re safe, but I can getcha
And do things to ya Lynch Hung can’t even picture
You’se a bitch nigga, and I be livin in new knowledge
Cross me up again, I take your baby girl for hostage

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ridme because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

And I be down for mine, wrote out my gameplan line for line
On how to get the money, same time blow your mind
Incorporated real soldiers from the O this time
Sellin all q.p.’s, whole o’s and dimes
CDs, LPs, now it’s g’s for us
Flip the table, bubble up, cash and weed to puff
Bet I couldn’t serve ya, so I laughed, called your bluff
Give me 12 months, bet you can’t ball with us
Ghettonomics is a major plus, enforced with muscle
Mind on the mega-money, heart on the hustle
Dirty women mixed with jealous friends, nothin but trouble
Got focus, keep your self-respect, and know who love you
You don’t have to be a star, baby, no need to front
Just gotta know where you’re tryina go, and what you want
We dissect and reconstruct the package like a surgeon
Bouncin twice, raise the price, ready to serve ya

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

For certain, I knew when I made it that it’d be curtains
For muthafuckas fakin the loyalty and desertin
Put it down, flashin on foes, when I’m pervin
Not silent, I’m hard to swallow like lead and Bourbon
Nigga feel me like a crack serum, no pretendin 
Link soldiers, uncompromisin, unbendin
Do or die till the very endin
Why do they fake it
Claim to be any muthafucka just to make it
It’s my dream, I’ma take it, seize it, no hesitation
No reservation, finally ready to face the nation
Attackin like a pit was raised, now can you fade me?
Writin bomb-ass shit off of hash the sight gave me
Is it greed got me chasin g’s or just in me?
To feed me and my only seed, so we proceed
All my enemies bleed as I puff up the weed
Forever hustle till we all succeed

I couldn’t wait to get atcha
It’s been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I’m knockin out your car system

(*talking*)
Yeah, flyest dude I might be yeah ay
The flyest dude I might be, yeah
Ay let me go on brush my shoes off real quick mayn

[Rasaq]
Wheels spin around, I got kill by the pound
If I turn up my sound, then it drown out the town
I’m thoed with the flow, I can clown with the nines
Blow green to the ceiling, come down to the ground
Is everybody thoed, or is it just me
I’m as fly as the sky, hell yeah I must be
Keeping G bundles, that’s my mindframe
Karats in my chain, if you thinking I’m lame
Nigga what is my name, Rasaq to the Mayn
Then to the Boy, cause you know that’s my saying
Skills I’m displaying, but the boy still playing
Pull me a yella, high hell Himalayan
Got them pills if you paying, nigga I’m just saying
Hollad at the Wayne, on his cash still weighing
I can shine brighter, when a nigga dark skin
Pull up all silver, in the back of Shark Fin
We don’t step out, naw we just park in
Spark in the parking lot, hit the bar for the Henn
With 50/50 Twin, we with fifty thicky friends
I’m talking dime piece, I ain’t talking fifty men
Nigga I’m flyer, than the feathers on a hen
Partna it’s my turn, so I’m finna set the trend
Gritty cause I want it, so I’m finna cop a Benz
Homie stop playing, hollows cave your chest in
Better wear your vest in, or you gon learn your lesson
I ain’t even worried, bout these boys plexing
Pants in the crease, got the starch pressed in
Putting buttons on my rims, like I went and dressed them
Boy who the thoedest, dumb question
I be stretched in a suite, at the Best Western
Boys plexing, but I’m a fly dude
Even when I’m not capping, man I still sound rude
Shoes brand new, and my money new too
Hit the bar for the rounds, bout ten then we through
Playa I should pull, you should try to pull too
Cause if I pull two, two for me and none for you
Hoes on my jock, till they sticking like glue
Hyper light lens, I’ma pull up on blue
I can’t even lie, fool I know I’m so cool
Cause when I step out, all the ladies going ooh ooh

(*talking*)
Hol’ up mayn yeah, we back in effect you know I’m saying
Royal Green boy, you wanna reach the Royal Green
Call 713-454-4881, and also 832-279-1270 mayn
It’s going down, in a major way boy
The grass greener over here mayn, rasaqboy.com

   
   As the last breath triggers the last beat
   I look to the sky to drown the devilish heat
   I feel it closin’, they’re gettin’ higher and higher
   Each foul flame from the same hellfire
   Only moments passed since I existed
   Perhaps I acted rash, I should have done what they insisted
   I resisted, twisted thoughts ran wild
   I was too mad to be mild, I was too rough to be riled
   But now it’s done, I probably won’t be missed by anyone
   Although I had my fun I’m still on the run
   Where am I goin’? It’s no good not knowin’
   Should be glad that I’m gone because my yellow streak’s showin’
   Thinkin’ have I done much wrong for me to perish
   Or will I have another day for me to cherish
   I have to bargain, see my soul’s on the line
   So I’ll settle for nothin’ lesser than the Great Divine
   
   Verse 2
   
   Friends worked hard to try and save me, why? They didn’t know
   If I was them I would’ve left me long ago
   It’s over, thoughts are trained towards the hereafter
   I look for The Saviour but then I hear laughter
   If I’m to make it through the Pearly Gates
   I have to devise a plan and get my story straight
   It ain’t too late to save my soul, I never lost a scheme
   I’ll talk to God and make him melt like an ice cream
   It seems this waiting is for reflection
   Then when it’s done I’ll go whatever direction I deserve
   But listen, I’ll deserve my place there
   Ok, I’m scared, but I don’t easily scare
   I’ll walk up, knock on the door like I’m the gentry
   Plead from my knee and they’ll proceed to give me entry
   I reflect on all the stealin’, the dealin’, the dissin’
   Hopin’ somewhere up in heaven that my file went missin’
   
   Verse 3
   
   I used to be a big man, like kings respected
   I carried out the sort of things expected of me
   And my posse, bred to be bossy
   Didn’t yield to command you felt the back of my hand, understand?
   I did dope, sold to kids who were thrilled by it
   I was responsible for many who were killed by it
   I didn’t realise then, but now I know
   I didn’t realise then, but even so
   I stole to deprive, scold those who patronised
   Fought for my turf, it was worth it in my eyes
   Cheated, repeated all this day by day
   Until the medic picked me up from where I lay
   Bleeding, but not conceding to the battle
   The darkness teased an unease, light bleeds staccato
   That’s when I knew I had to try it
   Prepare a prayer and pray he’d buy it
   Convince him, rinse him of my dirty past
   Rotten or right I must fight to the last
   Before the hands that pulled me down held tight
   I will repent before the love of life
   Fear cries, I’m drowned and bound to miss
   Valhalla, my seat in celestial bliss
   Infernal heat just like a creature creepin’
   Eternal sleep will be a lonely sleepin’
   
   Verse 4
   
   Father friend me, defend me
   Lend me your faith so that my fate don’t send me
   Down to the gates of Hell
   I did enough time inside a prison cell
   So take me, don’t forsake me
   Shape me from here so that my fear don’t break me
   Keep me from the terror that lies
   Beneath your kingdom, beneath the skies...
   
   Did he buy that? Well did he hear my prayer?
   I gave praise, I’m amazed he’s still up there
   He’s probably sendin’ down a heavenly host
   He’s just too busy to be leavin’ his post
   So I wait for a while but the Devil’s still posin’
   I wave goodbye while the gates are closin’ behind me
   You’ll never bind me or enslave me
   Hurry up heaven, come down and save me.

[Mystic]
Shit...
Make it drop niggaz...
Make it drop bitches...
Make it drop niggaz...

[Chorus]
It can make a tear drop, when the rear stop
After you drank that beer drop this shit here and
Chill with a nigga, blowin’ weed out my mouth
And plottin’ for figures, niggaz and gettin’ my wishes...

[Mystic]
You know the shine that I’m spittin’ is reminiscent
To what ya wishes is and whatchya wishes was and like everyone say
"Monkey see monkey does" that includes drugs or after a bitch in love
When you see me smokin’ I bet you the smoke is buds
Got me paranoid as fuck in a chair like my ‘Cuz
But that ain’t go happen, ‘cause then it’d be a faction of tramatic events
We’ll kill a bunch of niggaz and shit
Usin’ men as guinea pigs, and Ms. King, my Mama
Told me to "Bring the drama"
Dont never let another punk nigga ever crack on ya Mama
Dont let no niggaz bitch you like they is Osama
No offense, but a nigga sick of y’all hits
That’s why I make my own shit, to sound out his
Got me polishin’ my flow after a round with a bitch
Told her that my wrist go be big as Andre The Giants
Cept Imm’a be black producin’ like Andre The Giant
Let it drop

[Chorus]

[Mystic]
...Oh shit the rear stopped
Niggaz is clear for gettin shot, for snitchin ‘bout spots
That Mystie Myst sellin’ drugs nigga, like it or not
These niggaz rappin, braggin ‘bout pitchin cocaine in draws
Good for y’all, but I ain’t fuckin wit that, so I
Stay puffin weed inside of a caddiliac and god damn
It’s f’sho that the mask is black
We sittin in backs, if you plottin to make us starve
‘Cause I’ve starved long enough, I wanna get fat
Sit in the studio wit my new shit on blast smashin chicken and
Mashed potatoes, watchin my kids play wit legos Ain’t no hood nigga takin’

my life on a lay low
So if you die, it’s cause Mystie say so
I ain’t wanna have to mold y’all weak minds like play dough
But I got to show ya what’s up playa
I’m on the watch like Dre, smokin weed like Nate everyday
When you speak it ain’t scarey so watch what you say
I’ma be shittin on these niggaz till I get my pay

[Bridge]
Drop a tear for that nigga ain’t here ( yeah )
Drop a tear for the ex-con wit no career ( we here )
Damn that, we comin’ like fuck standards
Puttin’ a finger up like ‘pac to these mothafuckin’ cameras

[Mystic]
So it’s practically savagery I can answer those questions
But the ones about the body we ain’t fuckin’ wit
‘Cuz we sittin’ in the street watchin’ it buck then skip
Watchin’ some bitches tip a dick, laughin’ and shit
Differences between this shit go further than penis
My brain bigger than yours, plus I been schemin’
In my dreams screamin’, while you fuckin’ dreamin’, so take that in nigga
And it’s f’sho I’ma "Make It Drop" if haters get mad and hate
Give’em a bird a day then hydrolic on they face
See Mystic on channel eleven, insane but still rich
So it ain’t go matter this my, only career bitch
Downin’ Seagrams tippin’ on the back porch
Tryin’ to avoid a felony, or any date in a court
Niggaz put you in the state of inhuman, so I’m tryin’ to do this
Props to my niggaz makin’ movements, I’m self improvin’
Smokin’ to Old School and groovin’...
Be careful of the choices you choosen

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
Whaaaaa, what’s happ’n (alright, alright)
It’s Lil’ B.Gizzle, Tuck (yes sir, Polar Bear)
It’s from New Orleans, AKA Chopper City
All the way to T-Town, you know what I’m saying
And you know how a nigga rocking, uh-huh
It’s real on this end, you heard me uh-huh
It’s real in the field, you know I’m saying believe it

[B.G.]
I’m off the block, niggaz love me cause I keep it real
Hustlers respect me, cause I spit everything that they live
I got a connect with the pills, and the good dro
I get that coat soon as it hit Miami, off the boat
I got a glock I keep it on me, I don’t ever slip
Seventeen ain’t enough, I rock with that extended clip
Thirty minus four, that’s 26 so it don’t jam
Run up if you want, you run straight into that blam-blam
Blucka-blucka this Chopper City, don’t forget it nigga
I live and breathe this real shit, you gotta feel it nigga
I don’t be playing, when I tell you I be thugged out
Mouth full of gold T-shirt and bows, I be thugged out
I ain’t gon change, I don’t give a fuck if I’m Donald Trump
I’ll always represent Uptown, V.L. that’s where I’m from
It’s Chopper City in New Orleans, better ask around
Niggaz’ll tell you, that nigga B.Gizzle hold it down

[Hook - 2x]
You need it, rush up on him
He hating, bust up on him
He plotting, plot up on him
Show mercy, to no opponent
War better for it, guns this is what
Shock him, without a cord
Guerillas, not dinosaurs

[Big Tuck]
Get it how you live, be homeless or pay the bill
Drill a nigga or get drilled, kill a nigga or get killed
Niggaz be hating black, if you hate it you hating back
Stomp feet like alley cats, be on guard for all attacks
Always know what’s up, the best set up’s a yellow slut
If you set up by a slut, don’t be ashamed and chop her up
That bitch was out of line, time to show naked spine
Don’t leave no blood behind, use barets and terpentine
Say ain’t tripping on shit, got teeth that shine and gliss
Watching them watching this, make other teams forfeit
Swear to God I got a lot of niggaz, I swear to God they all gorillas
I swear to God they’ll kill a nigga, they specialize in end a temper
You simple you don’t want none of me, kind of Tuck you ain’t me
You can’t bite no mics like me, fa sho can’t box like me
War we done been in a few, who knew how many minds we blew
Coming straight to the Avenue, you beefing bitch it’ll happen to you

[Hook - 2x]

[50/50 Twin]
It’s like Jeeper the Creeper, my gorillas will eat ya
The feature delete ya, then put you in a box like speakers
Put you in a box like sneakers, if you try to box I’ll beat ya
My house or your house I’ll meet ya, discombobulate your facial features
They gon have to get jumped like teachers, step on you frauds like bleachers
Try to play hard but soft as peaches, your OG’s will prolly teach us
When I display the Mack-90, you gon have to poo-poo
Shit-shit then doo-doo, like you drunk a case of Yoo-hoo
Babies oh boo-goo, ga-ga-goo-goo got a boo-boo
Have control of what you do, or 50/50 will do you
Press charges then sue you, for getting blood on my who-doo
Lick shots when I shoot through, you got that chump now flee-shoo

[Hook - 2x]

[Intro: Yung Budd]
Uh, yeah, one more again
About to do it up, holla
Hahaha, one more time
Let the beat drop
This is something for life

[Yung Budd]
Mami, I’m mellow, love that Accapello
Stay John Blazed, pockets jiggle like Jello
Hello, hello, I’m that fellow
Flow mad sick so I got that cheddo
Call me, let’s fly to P.R.
Hit up the telly, I’ll buy out thee bar
Me’s a star, loves the name
Got mad whips, and I love rocking these chains
I got a wifey though, she’s at home
I’m a playa, can’t help it, horny, he got to moan
So, what you doing out in Rio? Where’s ya horse?
Only pimp out mami’s, rock Chris Dior’s
Said, "I’m here with my man, there he is"
This nigga tried to wild out, "I ain’t fucking ya wiz"
Mami feeling Yung C though, smaller version of Chino
5’8", brown skin, chips like the Rio
She knows, my pockets stay extremely cheesy
Ya girl feeling me, dog, you need to leavey

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
Stop the game...
Uh-huh, cuz I ain’t playing...
Faggot, stop the game...
Uh, cuz I ain’t playing...

[Yung Budd]
I keep my hat cocked, brim breezed up
Iced out wrist that ya homies could snow ski up
P4ers, carry big things like Ne-yo
Tell her hop in they block, incognito
Cats don’t know, what we know
But, they gonna find out when I’m blowing missles like Al ‘Cino
A Goodfella like DeVito, put a Scar on ya face
I spend dough so fast, need a parking space
Place the gates so tight, mami’s call me Matell
Put country music on the street, it better to sell
Ten million sold, got diamond rings
A bad chicked named Diamond with diamond chains
Nahmean? Big up B.K. for real
Come on, son, so please don’t squeal

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
So, stop the game...
Come on, uh, cuz I ain’t playing... (nah, that’s how it’s going)
So, stop the game...
Cuz I ain’t playing...

[Yung Budd]
It ain’t where you from, nigga, it’s where you at
When you rest at my hive, where he gon’ get your gat?
Cuz niggaz know I get more action than Jackson
The packing the mack then
Have the bullets loving your ass, fatal attraction
Hit you in the back, then, slide with Venus
So she can put it on me, like Ja and Vita
Ya everyday Bonnie and Clyde
No coke, no crack, just a little chronic inside
Plus I stay on top of the ride
I got them new rims that keep on spinning even though I stop at the lot
So I ride through the block where the haters rest
The rims make ‘em feel woozy while I spray they chest
Put ya hands up, nah, put ‘em down
I’m a real nigga, don’t fuck with clowns
He’s a circus act, who you smirking at?
I spread ya blood around the world so you could cross the map

[Chorus: Yung Budd]
Stop the game...
Come on, huh, cuz I ain’t playing...
It’s not a game, so, stop the games...
Come on, yo, cuz I ain’t playing...
So, stop the games... stop it, need to stop acting...
Cuz I ain’t playing...

[Outro: Yung Budd]
All the games is for these little guys, stop it, come on
Duck-Lo Productions, doing it up
Buddha Monk, good looking for the beat, dog
Daddy Warbucks, Love Blesser, holla... holla...

[Intro - Birdman - talking]
Yeah nigga
N-O, Philly (Philly)
You know?
C-M-B, one hundred

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
I was piss poor, water used to leak in my place
First we struggled, then we hustled ‘til the paper got straight
Copped weight, plates got scrapped
Then we chopped it up and bagged the twelve twelves, five eights
Twenty four/seven on my Kane shit, +No Half-Steppin+
For protection, kept a weapon on waist
We grind hard, if we happen to catch a charge
Two lawyers, Frank Spina, Lou Savino on the case
They, spank that, then we straight
I’m a neighborhood legend, Benz wagon with the hatchback
That was way back, before the contract
My right hand had a red Ac’ Legend
And we stay smokin reefer, havin marijuana sessions
We had y’all bitches gettin high, catchin contact
Any problem with you guys, nickel nine that
Bring my hood everywhere I’m at, I define reppin, yeah

[Chorus - Freeway]
We from the bottom, now we shinin with jewels
We keep on grindin and we rhyme like we got something to prove
But don’t follow me, follow my moves young’n
Don’t follow me, follow my moves young’n

[Birdman]
Yeah, we from the bottom and we grind with tools
Make money everyday, candy paint with jewels nigga
Don’t follow me, follow my moves young’n
Don’t follow me, follow my moves young’n

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Fresh paint, Pearl 40, honey racks on the Harley
On the grind every day, big mansions and Ferraris
Uptown nigga, where it all started
Big money, big guns out the hallway
Hit the hood in something new, stuntin every day
Blowin purple haze, with a 100K
With a hundred B’s, all stackin cheese
Y-M, C-M-B
With the Louis frames, with the curtains back
In the new Phantom, star light, laid back
Born rich, "Hood Rich", Cash Money, more shit
M.O.B., UPT, spent a mill’ on some keys, candy leather seats
Project life, tats and fleets
Hundred mill’, it’s what we eat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
Put up, shut up, y’all niggaz run up
Tag you with the burner for the +#1 Stunna+
Y’all niggaz never had flows like Freezer
Nigga please, you’ll never have cheese like Baby
Keys to the Phantom, not the keys to the Mercedes
"Last of the Mohicans", I’ll be sleepin with the cannon
I wake with it on and quake it on, whoever’s drawn
You play with it on, I stay with it on
Nigga try me, put the cannon to his wig
If he eatin, I am creepin, bring the cannon to his crib
No doubt, we will go on route
We move out for the money dummy, this is how we live
This is Birdman and Philly Free
We are eatin, gettin money off of words man
Came a long way from flippin birds man
If y’all niggaz hatin, just let it be

[Chorus]

Yo

[Verse 1]
I kills the hoe how I builds the dough
Ed chills the doe and won’t go below
I live my life and I get the type of
Vibe that get the vapors to write
Snakes in the grass make it hard to pass
If they add to my stash then fuck ‘em in the ass
Suspicions of a bitch even if she aint conspicuous
Entertainment fame changed it up that’s ridiculous
I just reminisce on the chick that was sucking my dick
If a bitch wanna get on some other shit
I just call the other chick like *bing, bing, bing*
You know the type that droppin off quick

[Chorus]
I’m killing her on the one, I’m killing you on the two
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kills a G on the three
I kill a whore on the four, open like a door
I’m killing her on the one, I’m killing you on the two
As usual, I kill a G on the three, I killed a whore on the four

[Verse 2]
Check the technique and the style that I’m freaking
High on a weekday, drunk on the weekend
You’ll never know that I fucked your hoe
But if you find out that’s alright though
I’m off to the next state, I got more chicks to meet
But Scott Lark is feeling this way
It’s time to scoop up your hoe and take her to the ‘mo
Then hit the studio then drive around ??my rope??
I caught a full fledged hitting skins missing your
with no permiss-ion, and when I’m gone niggas be all
One and a two, tres, and a four
It’s almost five o’clock and I aint busting no more...
So bring the noise and what the fucking thing you were sleeping over for
And just to stop on the tour
Back to your relationship
I know you’re gonna miss my dick
Although I did explode quick
I’m the hip-hopper, fly boot knocker
to the tick-tocker, you just don’t stop uh
Man...

[Chorus]
I’m killing her on the one, I’m killing you on the two
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kill a G on the three
I killed a whore on the four, open like a door
I’m kills her on the one, I’m killed you on the two
As usual, I killed a G on the three
I kills the whore on the four for all of y’all

[Verse 3]
Well I went up to my girl’s crib, guess what I saw
This cock diesel nigga taking off her drawls
So now you know the flavor when it’s time to flex
That nigga fucked mine and yours might be next
It kind of hurts man, what you didn’t hit yet
Even get vexed when you find that I get wrecked
Scott Lark got your hoe wide open
On the down-low and she be out scopin’
Man, I tell you like this
Bitch, bitch, bitch
I just, give some old shit, get you open

[Chorus]
I’m killing her on the one, I’m killing you on the two
(Bring it back, bring it back)
I stack the loot like a Jew, I kill a G on the three
I kills the whore on the four
Open like a door, door, door

I kill a hoe like this
I kill a bitch like that
I kill a hoe like this, yeah, yeah

Word is bond, all the bitches and the hoes
On the down low, see me on the down low, see me on the down low
Yeah to all my niggas, yeah, to my motherfuckin’ niggas
To my niggas, to my niggas
Word is bond, like that

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this

[Make make make] them bitches roll

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this

You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this

[Make make make] them bitches roll

I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this
I got gold chains, I got gold ropes
I got gold rims, I got gold spokes
You ain’t never seen gold like this
You ain’t never seen gold like this

You ain’t never seen gold like this

[Intro: Polite]
Reporting live from New York City, earlier today
A body was discovered by the Brooklyn peers
The effects of this racial tension seems to be spilling
Into the prison system, coalition fall in the lead of destruction, conversation

[Polite]
Yo, it’s time to start the revolution, they watching me (possibly)
Feds plotting to body me, and I’mma die shooting
The new Huey Newton, I move too strategic
Student of walk’ll seal your enemy secrets
You live for the moment, then die for the future
Corruption, sex and homicide’s all we used to...
(Tensions seems to be uprising, and underworld war has been waged
Coalition seems to be linked to a long string of corruption throughout the city
Federals investigation has been launched)
Yo, king in my right, cuz I was destined to win
Strength recognize strength, it’s the art of war
Study the board, acknowledge what your power hold
Recognize you a boss, and watch them cowards fall
(Earlier today, the attorney general has issued a statement
An investigation has been launched against this coalition)

[Chorus: Polite]
Yo, hat makes this world go round, underworld bosses
Why the poor man struggle to live?
Kids starving, you can see their ribs under they coat
Better watch ‘em, they dangerous when never provoked
What makes this world go round, this world ran by crooks
Coalition, and we off the books
We demand work, you front, your boss gets shook
Know the rules, in the heat of war, lives get took

[Cigar]
Yo, who got the contracts, we taking this shh, throw me the blueprints
Or get your wig shot, stuffed in the block of cement
Next in line, blow the laborer’s union
Yeah, I’m screwing these faggots on they property, like Monopoly
Money, it’s funny, I used to roll with this Italiano
Mafia hungry, schooled me how to get money, yo papi
Molding me, handing me manuevers for quick cash
But I’mma boss in the street, hammers’ll spit fast
I got the feds on the payroll, screw the connect
The black Al Capone, shoot or get wet
It’s all dirty money, my wolves’ll blast for me, yo, it’s like
We built the city while they had plans for me
But I show power, I lock the streets, where the mad hungry
Piranha coalition, shower the block money
I’m taking what’s mines, I’m going out, shooting off
M-60’s, watch how the crime boss go down

[Chorus]

[Polite]
Yo, come on, ya’ll know a gangsta don’t respect the rules
Don’t respect the law, what you expect, it’s war
Nigga creep through the window, never use the door
Last thing you saw, four fifth to your jaw
Go to work with the hammer, like they call me Thor
Black coalitions, specializing in demolition
Speak, this wicked world we live in, to my sons in prison
All my sons on the corner still pitching, get it
One life to live soldier, it’s like a shadow over
Your right shoulder, if you blink, your life’s over
Minute to live, but a second to breathe
Them cowards don’t wanna talk, til them weapons’ll squeeze
(In the world of corruption, money and money
The coalition’s seem to be sending a message
And could not be stopped in their reign to claim superiority
In this crime filled underworld)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Polite]
Come on, work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

* send corrections to the typist

[Hook]
It ain’t nothin nice {*repeat 8X*}

[Ras Kass]
Son I be skimmin through the billboard top for an R&B; album
Wonderin my outcome
Want the fat triangle but I’m real with or without one
Cause I’ma still sport wrinkles on my new jeans
Smokin beadies to the pink stream
On a microphone, I’m like the booty Michael Corleone 36 zone
The homies always told me to be the man, understand
If niggaz is playin hardball, then why the fuck you throwin underhand
See only the small modest mark time
That’s the reason that bustas still sellin nickel sacks and ganja
You two bit hustla, I’m the grown brother like clockers
Went and give you five cents to put cheese on the whopper
So steer near clear a mere near rear bia
I’m rollin with the crowbar clear
Still wearin my favorite suit like I was asshole naked
Now fake it till you make it or take it nigga

[Hook]

[D.B.A. Flip]
My motions in school going through a whole child
Ya pushin rocks on the block cause the spots what ya found
I made my dough and I made sure I kept my name on tight
Layin low in the day and turn the day by moonlight
They out of sight when they go wild
Just to let them ??? service cluck as they stroll by
Lowkey the smokies on my name
Ain’t no slippin when they crippin cause I done peeped game
Now I had closed, but then they ran me out
I sold my last ounce, then I bounced to my baby mama’s house
Kind of bill couldn’t get no kind of deal
Had to be out on them streets, hurry up and make my sales
But now it’s on cause I’m grown and I’m still a G
But it’s ??? I sell my crack by the tracks in this industry
Remember me when you hustle runnin right do or die on the side flip for life
biatch

[Hook 8x]

[Ras Kass]
Now it’s either give me the money, give me the power
Or give me 4.25 an hour, what the fuck you think I’m gone do
To be honest with you, I gonna get mine
Cause I known niggaz thats college graduates that’s broke
Askin for dimes and nickel sacks
Nigga give me that and I give you some
You watch my back I watch yours
I do rap chores while niggaz be looking for the rapture
I don’t understand cause niggaz gots to capture
Your own, now keep your eyes on the prize
Cause Clinton is peril, nigga you might as well be chimpin
I wanna be eatin jumbo shrimp and lobster
I want 200,000 in the bank, you wanna be the imposter mobster
Recognize like Sam Snead, I got ‘em four twins to feed
So make the next man bleed, I just might
Cause ain’t nothin right in my life
God help me, It ain’t nothin nice

[Hook 4x]
From LA to NY, ATL and back it ain’t nothin nice
To all my niggaz and my bitches throw your motherfuckin hands in the air
And keep ‘em there

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don’t rush me
Love is patient, and now you gotta trust me
to take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm
Or an unborn, carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for a start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn’t built in a day
and diamonds need a while ‘fore they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I’m paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste, and she said it wasn’t ready
She stir it up slow, and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I’m just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta start the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses?
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It’s a secret garden in my mind, flower child

[Nitty Scott, MC]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
when you bustling, hustling for the numbers and
you’ll miss the journey if you climb too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need to balance it
I want that legendary like Excalibur, chasing calibers
Liberated as a bachelor, traveler
Never falling victim to these calendars
Uh, rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting all my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I’m talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I’m talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain’t always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low, you’ll notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow, but only little you know
how it still breathe, give me the cheese
I’m resuscitating the game, see me and CPR, my name
is a gun cocked, gun shot, dead and I won’t stop
Gun cocked, gun shot, head in a pine box
with a dozen roses, holeless with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot, flowers on your momma’s yard

[Chorus]

[Nitty Scott, MC]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I’m just a lilac tied to the Earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow

I’m a blue scholar worker studying the art of labor to create
Flavor to relate to listeners, alleviate the danger associated with strangers
Isn’t it strange how we estrange ourselves from our neighbor?
Enables us through music to connect, releasing fluids in our neck
With the rhythmic forward movement of our heads and back again
Indeed as we succeed the pioneers
Maybe give back all that we’ve been taking through the years
I bleed, for what I believe to be the truth
Nurturing the seed planted in the fertile youth
The poetry, hanging from the branches eat the fruit
Pluck the most succulent to suck upon the juice
\xc2\x93So what’s up with you?\xc2\x94 frequently they ask
Been hibernating writing till the last page, ciphering the past days by
Bypassing the lies and the bullshit
Get up off the mic, and save it for the pulpit

Chorus (x4):
In the blue school, class is in session
Ask us a question, cause class is in session

I’m an exile, motherland stepchild, 
Metropolis dwelling middle America’s prisoner of war
Combat the paper till the blankness is gone
Listen now, talk about the beat after the song
Astronomical, cause that is just a modest measurement
Of my ability to represent my family correct 
Because I be about it, ain’t no other way to say it
Discovered my potential when I stayed late to tape it 
In the basement with an ancient karaoke stereo in lieu of a studio, 
We made due with everything lying around
And if I’m not mistaken isn’t that improvisation what Hip-Hop is all about
If you popping at the lip then I will sock you in the mouth
Sonically to render you the opposite of loud
Apology accepted in advance
I think its kind of cool at one point that you thought you had a chance

Chorus (x4)

A veteran’s fate written on pages of mixtapes
I’m all about a government that citizens dictate
Sick of fucking dealing with the presidents mistakes
To sit back and rant is just misplaced anger
So I cradle, pens, from now until the fable ends
Taken friends for granted, but now I’ve got to make amends
Calling out the big talk small walking cowards
High above the ground, yo we shaking down your towers
And demanding our money back, plus reimbursement
For parking and shit, I put my heart in this shit
And all my arteries connect to the amplifier wire
Music make the flames in my inner fire higher
I reinvent the language in the image of a dancer
Contorting where the floor becomes an answer
Blue school graduate dog, after this last verse
When the revolution comes we going to shoot your ass first

Chorus (x4)

(Here we are in this day and age still loyal to the state of confusion. Why
is it only tragedy when harmony unites the people of this nation. We must
learn to break this cycle of hate and disrespect among our brothers and
sisters and we must stop asking the question: why? Start spreading the
message of one love)

Verse 1: J.Flexx

My heroes catchin 3 or 4 thru they corridor
They blast on em, hit the gas on em, last call
A bullet make a life shatter like a glass jaw
Look like the devil gettin just what he axe for when the gas draw
They wanna blame it on the gangs but it’s a bigger picture
cos why we’re steady dyin somebody gettin richer
Listen to what I’m spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain’t all about the red and blue
cos some many’s corporations is gangstas too
They rub you out in a minute gettin greedier and greedier
Buyin out major labels and pimpin the media
Orchestratin beef between the west and east
Kill a superstar, blow up his next release
We got to put them straps down cos if you let them stay dead
Every death in black America is gang related
Yeah

Chorus:

A change is gonna come to our lives (A change to come)
I’m not sayin it’s wrong (A change to come)
We’ve reached a point and we have to decide (A change to come)
if we should go on (A change to come)

Verse 2: Tenkamenin

I’m fallin from the heavens screamin out "Lord please!
Let me go so I can check up on my younger seeds"
To show em right so they won’t reach these penetentiaries
cos over the years that’s what them folks want us to turn out to be, and
just release you
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
hang on the corner, smoke my weed and try to sell my drugs and show no love
In ‘97, all this had to change
So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it’s all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that’s on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
"Please let me make it thru this struggle" even though it’s hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro’s
Keep it up and best believe you, I will finally see it’s gang related
So we best to let the killin cease, now rest in peace

Chorus

Verse 3: J.Flexx

Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
before I wise up and stop lettin the devil tempt me
Usin materialism to jealousy to pimp me
Live by the gun, die by the gun, to put it simply it’s gettin shady
They got me mad like rabies, headed for Haiti’s
Sellin they soul for a Mercedes and fly ladies
All this dirt being done ain’t gang related
We got to take our former glory y’all, reinstate it

(People are in trouble in America. As a matter of fact, people are in
trouble throughout the Earth. We have returned into a force of death and
destruction on ourselves. We were never meant to be trapped in this
darkness, but there’s always light in the midst of the darkness if you know
where to find it. Nothin is impossible. If you know who you were you
wouldn’t wanna be anything but who you are. We have one change but one
cause and that’s to frown one love)

[ Lord 3-2 ]
"We can’t help you, we can’t help you," that’s some bullshit
Y’all don’t wanna hire a nigga cause I’m an ex-convict
Thinkin I’ma steal or somethin in the nature
Or the hoe who work at night, they think that I’ma rape her
Huh, just cause I’m a goddamn Ex-Con
Jobs treat my ass like an out-of-date coupon
Gettin me to go back is the gameplan
They might as well pin that shit up on the next man
On a mission, I can’t do it by myself, though
I need a down-ass nigga who let his nuts hang to the flo’
Knowin my man Lil James would understand
Hooked me up with a nigga from the Park named Peter Man
In no time we bakin beaucoup money
Bitch, I tried to get a job, but they were runnin from me
Another parole visit at noon
Why don’t you motherfuckers give my dick some breathing room
My address changed from my visit in the past
The PO mad as fuck cause I got better shit than his ass
Nosy as hell the honkey picks up my jacket
(Hey, what fell out the bitch, mane?) A goddamn packet
He headed for the phone in a den
I said, "Mr. Parole Officer, say goodbye to oxygen"
( *gunshots* ) Now that’s the end of that
Man fuck that shit, I ain’t goin back

(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)  --> Ice Cube
[ Big Mike ]
Me be on paper, you got me fucked up, G
(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)
Shootin you hoes out the sky tryina mark me a parolee
(Yeah, been lookin for yo ass, boy, you ready to go back?)
(Fuck that shit cause I ain’t the one)  --> Ice Cube

[ Lord 3-2 ]
Now I’m a fugitive again headed for Jamaica
(What about your girl?) Oh my .38? I’ma take her
Cause I don’t give a fuck about a female
I strap some bricks to her feet and let her ass sell
I guess I’m supposed to give ‘em slack, they figure
But when I was in they ain’t even know a nigga
Now I’m on the run again
Tryina keep my ass out the state pen
And I’ma tell ya, it ain’t a simple task
Even laws here in Jamaica on my motherfuckin ass
Like medicine to a cold, a basketball to a goal
A flag to a pole, a dick to a pussy hole
The head nigga in charge they wanna get
Take me back? Nah-ah, man, that’s bullshit
The only way I’m goin back is in a box
Dead as fuck with a pocket full of rocks
(Open the door, you nigger) Motherfucker please
So they bust through the bitch like City Under Siege
They shot, we shot, one of my boys fell
So me and Peter Man break like bats out of hell
Leavin 19 of the 20 laws dead
To be hid away we get away with DJ Ready Red
He know we can’t go out like that
I be good-goddamned if I’m goin back

(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)
[ Big Mike ]
Fuck the slavemaster and his damned penitentiary
(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)
He can forget that shit, there ain’t no motherfuckin catchin 3
(Hehehe, you better go back, boy)
(Fuck that shit cause I ain’t the one)

[ Lord 3-2 ]
Some are on the run, I’m in a track meet
I ainsta be shot, neither to get my ass beat
Neither taxed with a nite stick
Far as I’m concerned all you laws can suck dick
Rollin like a motherfucker hidden sess
Preachers preach and nuns gettin hit in the process
But that ain’t bother me a bit
Still rollin through the Nickel, shootin up shit
Laws still on my ass trailin
But my foot’s in the tank and I’m bailin
Dazed as hell I start rollin up some herb
Then I get an idea, so I pull to the curb
The laws walked up on us with they gats pulled out
Too late, you hoes, AK shots to the mouth
Put my shit in drive and threw away my gat
No weapon and no witness, so how can I go back?

(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)
[ Big Mike ]
You hoes in the courthouse won’t be crossin 3
(Here’s a little somethin ‘bout a nigga like me)
You know goddamn well he planted that shit on me
(Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary)  --> Ice Cube
[ Lord 3-2 ]
I ain’t goin back, motherfucker
You hoes got me fucked up y’all think I’m goin back to that biatch

I’m just looking for consolidaty
Isolated from the cemetery
Cuz everyday another tragedy
Most of homies they ain’t make it past 23
What’s scary is I’m still uncertain
Is it a Heaven when they pull my curtain?
Scared of reflections like a groundhog
Truthfully it seems I always tend to doubt God
Out of place like I’m dislocated
And I’m feeling unappreciated
Finding comfort in this rock and a hard place
At this point call me Judas I betray grace
Bad decision good intention
Bad decision good intention
I’m just looking for an angel
And I’m praying for a savior
They frontin’ on me like I’m rosa Parks
But still I’m focused concentrating like I’m throwing darts
Cold blooded got this ice inside my veins
And that’s reality for me just so I can find a way to numb pain
Forest Gumpn’ from the tribulations
I making friends with satan
I need some medication
Cause death is looking beautiful
They say success is represented at your funeral
Running circles like a rat wheel
Felling invincible I hide behind Achilles heel
Seeking distorted love I’m looking for divorce
Infiltrated by the poison like a gift inside the Trojan horse
I’m Infested by these cockroaches
Leeches
They try and use you cuz they know you chosen
Golden
Ground the path I choose to walk on
Still I’m steady climbing to my pinnacle like King Kong
So insane I stare at padded walls
Climbing mountains but I always seem to slip and fall
Started from the bottom and that’s real ain’t no metaphor
But you won’t see inside my heart core
I’d give all just see the love
Though I know it’s mine it’s fitting like its OJ’s glove
Controlled by imperfection
Seeking for acceptance
Off balance like I’m ice skating
Persuaded by anything that glorifies a lack patience
Living for approval
Dying from rejection
Temporary like the pain of a lethal injection I’m infected
I’m just looking for an angel
Praying for a Savior

[Lyrics Born as Steven]
Aww man it’s been bad man, I’ve just
It’s been so tough on me and everybody involved
And it’s the type of thing that just
it brings everybody down! You know?
And, I tried so hard to change
But just one slip up you know
I know that my habit’s out there right now
doin pushups, and situps, and squats
just ready to kick my ass as soon as I fuck up man
Y’know, and it hurts!
Y’know I went through my money
I went through my mother’s money
I went through my girlfriend’s money
I went through my girlfriend’s ex-girlfriend’s money

Sup ya’ll this is Ebony I’m from a playah’z hole with young lay

(Young Lay)
Now there’s a dope rhyme sale up in this town
Listen to the sounds I bring
I be dropping hoes be jocking like feens
I comes so clean when I spit in his mouth piece
Coming with that young playa shit fools get with or without me
Living life dangerously but hoes be in the nickel mix
When I think I hind of this but silly rabbits full of tricks
But I don’t trip let her be a mac though she ain’t
Baby bought the rules in the fucking dank
Tip toed out the door right after I g’d her
I wanted to do the crew so how the fuck am I going to sleep with her
I liggity loc the side digged her down like I’m straight
I bet that trickity tramp bitch keep me down now I’m back on the set
Kicking up some more though yea hoe that’s how it works
I told her I’am getting paid cuz the game is like some minute maid
I still got hoes to faint
LAY DAMMIT my nigga played the dozen running through her crew
Her sister partner and her cousin
School I though you know in 92 but it’s only buzzing
Then up in 93 in the vidy there always up to something
The po or not got you running way past 94 cuz they couldn’t find me though
Chillin up in my playah’z home

[Chorus 2x]
Make ma ma ney ma ney
Make ma ma ney ma ney
That the way we do it
Off in my playaz home

(Young Lay)
I spit some game at these hoes they can’t get a hold of
I said to be with me I going to need somebody I can fold love
Steady cashflow where a nigga should be getting strady paid
On breaking a bitch and leaving a hoe with some juice and change
You got a job hoe and you know u need to get one
To get with me cuz see I need to get some income
Straight pimp the p, i, m, p, the bitch that be steady pleasing me
Cuz now I’m a mc
I can’t wait got a date in jamaca
Me and the chocolate trip on a trick with some dank huh
I threw my loccest side gruve in and put my dick smooth in
And now she want to plan to move in
I told the young baby like this
I hear that shit she dropping put some heam in the spliff
And quit the panties dropping what do I mean naw
I gots to go back to velliho hit the L’s in my playah’z home

[Chorus 2x]

(Young Lay)
Back in the day I used to be tripping off the messy hoes
Young life been a trip peeped the pimp game
Ever saw the straight up used to check a hoe
Getting it for the means though
Fast talking comment brains full of bomb in
See pencils never come in
Always with that to the gangsters that used to spit rap
And still took heat and ol shcool kick back
But now they living phat growing up off of my shit
Why you g’d l y be you little ol suckas
They can never get enough of this loccest shit
Running up in your bitch niggas scared to get a  dose of this the game
The shit you was on up on but let you tell it
They never knew about my crew and hoe we in the valley
Late night creeping out the back door
Dank box in my demo tape they wouldn’t play me though
I gained publicity now they like to listen see
I turn nuts when I hits the set nigga what
But now I got to find me a bigger cut niggas hate
To see me in triggers got the biggest gut
I pulled the shit now I’m stuck
Yo young lay where you stuck
Off in my playah’z home

Chorus

Intro over chorus:
I ain’t scared to play. Let me see that. What you doin?
Your not playin this game right. You gotta spin it, spin it.
Just like that, spin the barrel. I’ma try it!
Spin the barrel! Watch I ain’t scared. Watch this, watch! *gunshot*

[Thirstin Howl]
Poured blood, ignored love, even Thor trusted a little devil
in all us, the motor that keeps cheatin wives, lawns cut
At a fallen temperature before I’m even warmed up
At the speed of thought, thug niggaz fight for a needless cause
All you hear is "stop the stealing" when nearin stores
Uncommon Valour with the French make players take the bench
Above the rim without touchin the net
Thirsty, greedy, sometimes desperate
When I lock rap down I’ma booby trap the exit
Barracade the entrance, turn demonics screamin into harmless kids
Whispers, no challengers
Winnin the belt, if I say I’m top notch, I’d be just limitin myself
MC’s bore me like elevator music
Street panhandlers with ?three-socket? sewage
All A & R’s named Ufid
If life’s a bitch I’m one of her two kids
A motherfucker, if the show fits
If rap was a school I’d be teachin at Yale’s institution
Brooklyn hardrock, with a toothpick
Threatenin your life and safety with new risk
Scillionaire, after I burn MC’s I give ‘em 
  information on free clinic care

Chorus: All
You get one shot, one chance to bust
Who bust first? first to get slain
Playin Russian roulette
*repeat*

[Mr. Metaphor]
My lyrics sprout like a brussle, son
I get you open like a ?claire-o? mussle, I might jam my knuckle
Break it down raw like Brickface and stuck-o
Eat you like a dick steak you fucko! *echoes*
Whip you with my belt buckle, you wanna scuffle?
Pull your card while you suffer, I bag your bitch like a duffle
And grill you like a ?wild nigga? fall like ?Allah fall?
I remove your tonsels I’m out for kids like youth hostiles
Inhale force fires, blowin trees out my nostrils
Diggin underground like carbon pipes outta fossils
I wet you up like ponchos on a dark, stormy night
And spark forty mics, I beat you up like forty dykes in Brooklyn
You’ll get taken, tooken for every nook and cranny
I’ll stick your daughter and the nanny, take your baby’s candy
Grab the brandy out the cabinet 
Take any found inhabitant and make his mind inadequate
I spit my lyrics accurate, immaculate
Its hard to capture it you don’t got half my wit
You better find an advocate to plead your rapture
I leave your hands in the air, you leave in laughter
Stuck in the intro, I’m on the final chapter

Chorus

[Pumpkinhead]
I play roulette, with five bullets in the revolver
The problem solver, rhyme evolver, descendent of Ghana
Usin the marijuana to blaze niggaz like lava
Hot like sippin java in the sauna
I’m cold blooded like iguanas
My rhyme takes form, cock back the hammer on the biscuit
I make stroms, the weather wizard, hordes to never visit
Heaven’s gimmicks, my arms cross in b-boy positionin
Mix hydro with nitroglycerin
Pose with the mic in the tie hold lyrics hard like pistol whippen
I studied out the nigga mysticism
And still quick to catch you like prince of principal medism vision
I’m about to pull the trigger gotta make a quick decision
The sweat drippin cloudin my wisdom, lost my religion
I guess thats the cost of livin in this world
With no girl, no jewels or pearls
Confirmed my new script, my thoughts is suicidal sick
I pull the trigger all I hear is a click
My thoughts is sick, I pull the trigger all I hear was a *gunshot*

[Building Block]
Then I rise and shine from lies to blind the mind’s eyes
And ties that bind, you’ll find your rhymes are dime-sized
Compared to mine, you got no concepts
Eatin from my table of contents take words out of my context
My language is, like Arabic too complex
Got you mixed like marriages
My songs flex from my larynx, vex ya like a labyrinth
I stab ya with, my daggerith, your haverith
The Block hit, toxic material thats hazardous
Ya bring life like Christ of Nazareth, then Lazarous
Fabulous how I be rackin, presence to rap kiss
In fact this radioactive flows that hold you captive
Tracton’s own home is where this rapper roams
And catacombs, trap your poems and stay witcha like chaperones
Control it with a dart like Napoleon Bonaparte
You get stoned and sparked, bones and burn poems like Joan of Ark

Chorus

[Repeat Chorus]

JON says listen to the context
Nonsense is spitted from the onset
The concept is there is no concept
Honest I’m living to be songless
Pon’drance given where the Conch is
Gone are the limits of your bondage
Taunted by many golden launches
Homage for kids who mind their conscience
I’ve been taught that rhyming
For the diamonds and the platinum
Ain’t the way to make it happen
Cuz the shining is the mind and
Not the climbing up the stacks and
It ain’t the placement on the racks man
Listen to the heart and not the charts bro
Shatter from the start or fall apart slow
That’s the hardest part? I thought so
Practicing the mark’ll put a dagger in the art

Fugitive fingerprints lifted from the sink
Rubber gloves plugged with ink, one would think
The funk of drink isn’t odd, is it?
Escort service is livid, didn’t visit
Dividends raised to midget senseis
Rent’s paid, and French braids for ten days
Feds play the tapes back
Making guilty parties wish that they’d erased that
Infected needle in a haystack was found
Chasin after the help to pat her down
No more cap and gown, the cuffs clicked
Drugs sniffed by trained noses, busted
Searched for hours, no hope in sight
Eyes open wide, seeing a broken pipe
Quite an oversight of the forensic team
Even Cochran can’t defend a fiend, end the scene

It’s no accident that we’ve been put before you
Adamant that what you need to know
Is brandishing your talents like a sword to
Tap into the force and feel the flow
Guardians of positivity and change
Putting on a hellafied show
If the audience ain’t ready for the strain
Then tell me what the hell they here fo?
Though love I curse and put you down
But it’s only cuz I want to see you grow
Wizened in the ways of slangin sounds
So I’m clowning when you stumble as you go
Inexperience’ll lead to wearing crowns
For now, baby steps are how you get around
If you never swim, well then, you’ll never drown
But if you never try you’re never found test your limits

Only double time I’m down with sixty plus a week
Come combust with me, man we crush a beat
So CPR’s a kiss of death
Are you arisen yet, frigid with imprisoned breath
Give Annette my best wishes In Dreams of flicks
Never lending credence to your greed and bliss
Cheeba hits for demon kids, nitro practice
Maestro massive subtract the psychoactives
Knifes and acid leave your promo gear with holes
Lend me an ear I’ll sear the weirdest soul
Spill convos to fist fly friends
And see your life with a fish eye lens
Why mend a bridge over a porn ‘stache
Stitching Ecko labels over you Jordache
What’s the format, pasty as hell
Even Damien said I’ll make your cranium melt

[J Formz]
I said I came in this game with an aim to be famous
I ain’t there yet but I damn sure ain’t nameless
Struggle, hustle, grind, it’s a loop
Keep the game on my mind, use the rhymes to verbally cock back and shoot
Wanna fuck around and get hit with a stray?
You’ll be my bitch for a day and when I spit it you’ll say
"Are you from Wu Tang?"
Nah, why? And his reply was "Cause you god (U-God) in this game"
What else can I say? I can’t help that I’ve slayed
Every rapper that stepped up and fell in the grave
So learn your place and don’t ever step out of line
You can run and hide but eventually you gon’ run out of time
I’m sick of these cats askin’ for 2 for 1
The only 2 for 1 you gettin’ is 2 bullets from a shotgun
Into your 1 body
And have the by standers like "Damn, that was really a killer shottie"

[Chorus]

[J Formz]
Now I don’t know if these mother fuckas feel me or not
But for all these cats that rap now, I’m stealin’ all props
Cause I’m real and you not, I know how it feel to be hot
Makin’ deals for the crop and pop the steal on the block
Now you feelin’ a shot and I don’t wanna deal with the cops
So I peel off the block and ask you "How it feel to get popped?"
Now 2 minutes ago you was runnin’ your mouth
But when I pulled out, you tried to run in your house
You don’t belong
Why gamble with your life? If you’re thinkin’ I won’t strike, I’ll tell you
right now, you’re wrong
Stupid me, I’m tryin’ to help these kids out too
How am I gonna warn you cats what you shouldn’t do?
But cats wanna act hard so send ‘em in
Soon enough I’ll have his boys sayin’ "Remember him?"
Actin’ invincible like I can’t reach ‘em
Sometimes they gotta learn the hard way and I’m glad to teach ‘em

[Chorus]

[J Formz]
Always spittin’, always rippin’, with this shit on the lock
Weather the written is hot or I spit off the top
Just listen, I’m not one of those kids on the block
Who just wishes he’s not the next kid to get dropped
I’m the one with the cash and the drugs in the stash
I’m the reason that that kid’s gotta watch his ass
They the ones doin’ the forntin’, I’m the one doin’ the huntin’
Actin’ like you doin’ sometin’ when you just doin’ nothin’
I ain’t just sittin’ here puffin on a spliff like it’s nothin’
I’m thinkin’ of somethin’, metaphors and some punches
G-Town still here through all the hatin’ and fightin’
But I figure a lot of cats gotta hate that I’m writin’
But I don’t give a fuck cause the more they hatin’ I like it
Cause next time I write a verse I just say it to spit ‘em
So you pussies better think twice before you attack
Weather it be in the streets or on a verse in a rap

[Chorus]

J Formz: Yeah. Dolla Bill, it’s a wrap...Out

(*talking*)
Shit this your boy Z-Ro
Fucking with Mike Dean, at www.thesenuts.net
We ain’t gon sweat

[Hook - 2x]
I hate you bitch, I hate you bitch
I hate you bitch, I never thought I’d say

[Z-Ro]
Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I’m on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I’m trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii’m, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can’t understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride
I was daddy for a while, though I’ve got no seed
But the kids, are my H-E-A-R-T
I’ve been dealing with a lot, so I’ve been losing my mind
Straight up acting before I think, barely using my mind
My freedom is on the line, and my sanity’s gone
You picked a fine time to leave me, now this house ain’t a home
I had no problem being faithful, I loved you so much I hate you
Because you left me, when I needed you the most
So now a bitch, is how I rate you
My female friends, making you wonder
Guilt got you feeling suspicious, from when you was creeping on me
On the under, but even still I held my head
Five kids and I fed em all, with moldy bread and spreads
Them was my motherfuckers, treated em like sisters and brothers
But somehow I fell out of place, fucking with they punk ass mother
I apologize, I wish I can turn back the hands of time
Wishing we could pillow fight, just one more time
But Ms. Ronda, wanna put them laws in my life
Although I’m happy, I never pictured you not at all in my life
Solo that’s how I kick it, the rest of my days
But I wanna thank you for making possible, some of the best of my days
I’ve dried my eyes, now and all they can see is the greed
You can have that jury, broke ass motherfuckers the seventh scene

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I’m on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I’m trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii’m, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can’t understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride

But the kids, are my H-E-A-R-T
I’ve been dealing with a lot, so I’ve been losing my mind

[Hook - 2x]

[Sadistik]
When the weather weathered I just knew it was time to go
I control the world and the bruise on my isotopes
never left, so I took another breath
And this history repeats so I think I can write my own
I can go, to the edge of the Earth
to bury my beliefs that I shed at my birth
Are nefarious and weak so they’re left in the dirt
I’m so very incomplete but I tend to divert
From this sunken lovesick life
I’m rambunctious, sunkissed, tongue split wide
Where assumptions come with unfit times
That encompass, nothing, some just die
With no place, to call a home
Don’t face, it all a
lonely in the crowd face is familiar
If that’s what it takes to be safe from the killing birds
Fly high now while I find out
Why a little bit of liquor can define my style
Everything’s broken and the house is full of mirrors
And this apathy’s a sickness but I doubt that there’s a cure
When I’m drowning in obscure references
in a world where it’s evident the girl wasn’t medicine enough
So I take another puff puff cigarette
Is it because I know that I can never be innocent again now?

[Intro: Demarco]

Pull up! Never said could of...
Made it to the top, then threw my hood up (Eastside!!!)

Fresh out the block, made it to the billboard
Throw my Lamb doors up, then kick a field goal
Still ‘gon ball out, ‘til I let my dog out
Drinkin that Ciroc Redberry ‘til I fall out, Montana!!!

Yeah, I’m ready, yeah

They wan’t me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
With my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won’t let ‘em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I’m ready)

All the stares
And all the glares
They waitin’ on him
And all the weight
From all the hate
It’s gainin’ on him
The intensity as he rises
Nobody can disguise it
It’s like he got fire in his eyelids
The crowd is roarin’
It’s so enormous, his blood is boilin’
His head is burnin’, he’s focused
He wishes they ignore ‘em
Who in they right mind
Want to let his light shine
He ain’t even in his prime
Pressure of a lifetime
He standing steady, hands sweaty
Maybe nervous, but ready
The skepticism lies heavy
He’s bout to make it ready
He got his fam on his back
Bout to carry like Chevy
So much on his plate
He hopes the repercussions ain’t deadly
But he ain’t gonna back down
For what he faces right now
And he knows that he will outstand every
Doubt and turn around
The inceptions are knocked out
There will no longer will be doubt
He hears them boo but he won’t stop til his name is what they shout

They wan’t me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won’t let ‘em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I’m ready)

He’s no longer fearing
He’s swervin’ past ‘em and persevering
The way he’s staring is clearing
All that could be competition
Immediate intuition is winnin’
He’s never slippin’
Been hearin’ them sayin’ that he could be the best that ever did it
Their expectations lie high
So he’s just prayin’
Can I be the best man I could ever be to exceed everything they want me to be
No anxiety, just gonna do me and always proceed for the ones that believe
In the young man that’s dedicated with a potential to achieve
So I’ma keep goin’, keep flowin’, keep knowin’
I’m the dopest
My rhymes are potent
But I’ma need you to know it
I know where I came from but I stay so hungry and focused
Like I was focusin and wasn’t million in one of the closest
Great expectations I got em waiting and anticipatin’
They all debatin’ on if he’s hype or will he be stayin’
So now I’m sayin’, I’m reachin’ to be one of the greatest
So if you hate it take it cause I won’t stop even when I make it

They wan’t me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No, I won’t let’em break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I’m ready, I’m ready)

Staring in the heaven with my headphones on
I can see it in my eyes and know
That I’m the one they have been waiting for
I know my dreams are waiting for me
And looking down ain’t the way to go, noooo

(Follow your dreams, follow your dreams we got great expectations)

Not til’ they screamin’ my name, yeah [x2]
I ain’t gonna give up the game, yeah [x3]
Not til’ they screamin’ my name, yeah [x2]
I ain’t gonna give up the game [x3]

The alias you’ve been living under the mac goes, thhhhhhring

Heavyweight rap, I spit too much for you to swallow
Blap, blap, number one with a bullet

Your stupid ass get, clapped, blap
About my past and my future, you disrespect me, I’ll shoot ya

[Cam’Ron]

[Santana]

So I’m willing to blap, for mister Peedi Crack, listen to Beanie Mac, bitch

[Beanie Sigel]

Run up on you with the harsh grammar, all he heard was the charge blammin’
I’ll stop your memory nigga, put that on my death, got the memory nigga
How could you not remember me, nigga?
Top of the city like wheel pin, Bentley wheeling
Made you park your wheels in, niggaz start your wells in
Death aproaching, can’t you feel the Grime Reaper floatin’?
Closed caskets, the preacher, quoatin’
Scriptures for revelation, niggaz talking shit and got the Devil waitin’
Uh, I’m like this I got the shovel waitin’
You niggaz took it to another level hatin’

Yes, you heard it all from Mac
Niggaz can not see me, and it’s just like that

Ahh yeah mic check 1, 2
Eightball and MJG space-age forever

[Eightball]
It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I’m full of them trees
A dog wanna hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin’ on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin’ machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin’ grinnin’
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin’
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain’t you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil’ something that I really wanna hear, baby have no fear
I’ll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil’ something that I really wanna hear, baby have no fear
I’ll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night

[MJG]
I was chillin’ at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I’m bored I ain’t did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That’s a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what’s up
She said (What’s on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’
We straight ya ain’t gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin’ at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin’ there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she wanna romance, did she wanna hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin’ on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin’ on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I’ma be a lil’ late gettin’ in)
Now I was feelin’ kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let’s me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let’s re-write in the middle of the night

[Hook]

[MJG]
I’m on late night mission top let down
That’s the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin’ ‘ike I wanna take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin’ all the way to the end
It’s just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin’ in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I’m gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin’ in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin’ in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin’ out the few tail I’d like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin’ out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain’t nothin’ shakin’ but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I’m fixin’ to break em’ to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I’ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin’ me off from my flight

[Hook x3]

(where my keys at?)
six tray... 
six tray...
no joke

Six tray, well hey, what do you say today?
some ol’ silly ass fools I’ll spray
now I wanna cruise some schools
like what you can, be cool
fast up Texas ?? fool
blue eyed devil killer
black man, a nine millimeter
in a presidents residence false evidence is evident
black six tray, who
out of shape, out of date girls
nigga’s way cool

Six tray, well hey, what do you say today?
some ol’ silly ass fools I’ll spray
hittin’ switches on Crenshaw
let me tell you what I saw
had a fight, hit a nigga, socked him in the jaw
now my head is swolled, damn this waters cold
maybe I shouldn’t have attacked
nah, fuck that
six tray

We can cruisin’ in my six tray (x2)

g, it all started at birth
I wanted to see how much my hood was worth
was born to be a child of voodoo
do as I do, follow and move you 
to the rhythm blues with a blue-r curse
sunken in rib cage, a point blank range
blow from a twelve gage, better get him a nurse
split second too late, brown hearse
right door second, left door first
I noticed my flaw in a plan
everything was rehearsed
two knocks on the door, but they did everything twice
received the device, two pairs of latex gloves
a scalpel, a rich knife
looked at each other and said let’s get it on
strapped the body down, checked the temperature
to see if it was warm
stick man sculpture on front side
skin splits in two, reveal insides
now it was a homicide
as it drove away, I heard bullets ricochet
and a hell of a skid marks left from the six tray

See ‘em off, give me a call
and we can roam, we can roll in my six tray
????, give me a call
and we can roam, we can roll in my six tray

We can cruisin’ in my six tray
We can cruisin’ in my six tray
Anywhere, anytime, any day
We can cruisin’ in my six tray

yo, so if you ever, if you ever
see a tray rolled up with the lights out, 
smoke coming out of the window
you better lay the fuck down and run
this is a six tray

We can cruisin’ in my six tray (x4)

nigga is you smokin, do I look like a mutha fuckin dope fiend
now this shit’s gettin kicked off

so more words is passed

I dashed too cuz murders like the livin hell
I put the lead on ya, an risk 25 wit an L
instead of bein a down low nigga, hang on no coat tails
rig-ups, big licks an fake dope sales.

When I was 5 years old I was told there was a road

an yay is for metallions
niggas smilin in my face to get the safe code
I lace hoes

federalis beat yo ass up in the alley
nigga the jar was shook up, until the caviar was cooked up
(Whalla)
"There you are, eh Mr. Creamery ya think ya slick

Nigga, it’s called the drought season

Verse 1 *(Choppa Saan)*

I know a girl named Renee from around the way
she like to do it all day sippin Alizae
brought her back, from Atlanta, GA
posted up in the Bay she say she do whatever I say
got a cousin named Shanee who loves to play
doin it "My Way" like Usher Raymond
a bad chick
from the Camen Islands
profilin, stylin
bout to have ‘em both wowin
smilin at the ass
in high heels
I sit back
an watch ‘em peel off they clothes
they wanna serve me like Vogues
in a sideshow
the main shows are high an dope
remote controled like Tyco
"Bad" like Michael Jackson
stone cold mackin
lights, camera, action
they got me laughin, cuz I’m high
and I’m filmin low budget
and I’m rubbin on a stomach
Renee lovin it
Shanee suckin her lips
rubbin her hips
talkin bout call up some mo friends
aight, I’ll hit Mr. Taylor in the Benz
tell him "Once again it’s on, I got to turkeys in the ozone gettin it on, 
come on homes?"


Chorus *(Choppa Saan)*

I know a girl named Renee from around the way

(Bound to get lucky!)
She got a cousin named Shanee who loves to play
doin it "My Way" like Usher Ray

Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)


Verse 2 *(Mr. Taylor)*

I love a girl like Tish, that works the twist
does the twist
make a brotha yell "Baby girl don’t stop that twist!"
watch her ass clap as she shake it from the back
I hate when the tush looks like it’s been mushed
I give the girl a push
if not, she have ya spot smellin like the "Dock Of The Bay"
front the girl off, an send the girl on her way
no B.S. dout
but Dorthoy used to work a playa like straight on out
you swore you had a date with hope
but I couldn’t cope
cuz the broad needin major Scope
and a halitocious and majortroticious a playa couldn’t focus
pour some brew an cut like hocus pocus
"Who beeped me?"
Can it be who stay in apartment "C" remindin me of Tooty wit the bodacious 
booty
know me as "Pooky"
wants to swoop me an bob her head on my Suzuki
Now why’s that?
Cuz Mr. Taylor knows where it’s at!


*(Chorus)*

I know a girl named Renee from around the way
she like to do it all day sippin Alizae uh!
Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)
She got a cousin named Shanee who loves to play
doin it "My Way" like Usher Ray
all day
Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)


Verse 3 *(Choppa Saan)*

Everybody know how we do it in the Bay
big flossin an grindin, everythang all day
the playas on the turf
the girls in skirts
gold diggas in the club puttin in work
store clerks actin like jerks while we flirt
shootin the lip
wit this tight lil chick
will mommy help this little Filipino trick
that I met on Reno-Novado
playin Keno drinkin Vodka out cans
stop ???
when I feel that I got ya
an I’m still watchin
we both jockin
she was not too spoiled ridin, forget, forgot ‘em
I hollerd at that ass an I kept mobbin
"Baby keep it poppin", is what I hollered on my way out the doe’
I take a shower
hit the airport in a Supersport
ballin on the court
hit a triple double
an I quickly go for broke no joke
ask my playa folk how burn rubber leave ‘em smoked
man I’m from the "O"
from the "O".


*(Chorus)*

I know a girl named Renee from around the way
she like to do it all day sippin Alizae uh!
Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)
She got a cousin named Shanee who loves to play

Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)

Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".
(Bound to get lucky!)
Sittin by the "Dock Of The Bay".

When I was twelve, while checking the mail
I was admirin’ the car of the man next door
And thinkin’ to myself, man, one of these days
I’m gonna have me a house like that, with a big red door
And his yard was mowed, and his grass was green
And the driveway was edged and all the shrubs were trimmed so perfectly
I had a crush on his wife and I played ball with his son
I pondered how much money he made, went inside and turned the TV on

And he was layin’
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say

I was watchin’ TV, havin’ one of mum’s famous rice crispy treats
Watching Tom & Jerry, I heard a car, horn beeped
I ran to the window, his wife and son were home
With bags of stuff they had got at the mall
I went in my room and got my glove and ball
I leapt up the steps and asked his son could he play
And his son looked at his wife and his wife told his son I guess it’ll be ok
That beautiful woman, she walked in that beautiful house
When I realised I forgot my hat I said I’ll be right back and turned around

And he was layin’
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say

There was screaming, there was crying
There was silence, I thought I was dreamin’
And the sun was shining, it was a beautiful day
His wife was talking to an officer, through the noise I heard her say

And he was layin’
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said

And he was layin’
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said

And he was layin’
In an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said
He had a smile on his face, his final offer
The steam on the mirror said, I got one more thing to say

Forever N Forever - FNF U-P
 
[Chorus]

[Verse One]
There’s no back up nigga
This is the last plan
Stuck in a tunnel like a CAT scan
And planted in city barren desert, it’s a flat lands
African misplaced
Catch me up on stages, one fist raised
The gas can on my waist, the match poised to strike
A tongue forked with the poisonous bite
The poison ivy with the cordless mic, see
Jean’s the dawn before the atomic lightening
The spawn of everyone who never liked me
(I’m bi-polar)
Born to fight me in the morning I’m losin’
But when the darkness moves in who’s to win? I’m more than likely
Abuse highly, I bruise lightly and move swiftly
If choosin’ sides I’d advise you to fuckin’ move with me
Your steps shitty, you doo doo
I step pretty, my two shoes equipped with two razors that eject quickly
This isn’t riddle rap, it’s just a little harder
So put your thinkin’ caps on, nigga, I rip smarter
S. Dot Carter song, cover a rap lover
I’ll jack a fuckin’ beat from your mother
I trust none of ya
I’ll pull the ground from under the front of your Hummer
Let it roll back til the phone crack some of your bones black
I hold back nothin’
I’m told that, you chose frontin’
There’s no bluffin’, I’m so bold I rock gold nuggets with no budget
That’s tucked in another chain
Shit, 1999 and some change, I give a fuck

[Chorus] [x2]
Oh Lord
Why did you send, the darkness to me?

[Verse Two]
Brace yourself like a plane crash stance
The words ‘break dance’ all over your face and hands
And I’ll be damned if you motherfuckers think you’re advance
Makes you better than me, better change those plans
This is your introduction to new thinkin’, a new inning
I’m through sinkin’, I swim through it, I’ve been doin’ it
Since ‘95 pursuin’ it
9 to 5 with a 24/7 nigga, think of booin’ it
Jean ruin rap dreams like a teen losin’ and screwin’ in the backseat
Quittin’ school, pregnant from doin’ it, I’m
So calm and collected, but so drama conflicted
This life’s trauma made a horrible sickness
So I spit somber and liquid grammar
Lip with the humor and mixed with the tan
The wicked stamina to consumers
A storyteller with a story
Everything I’ve been through with
You can’t ignore me any longer
Never confuse it with
Anything other than rap music
That new shit
Clap your hands to it or clap your man to it
Or get mad, you can’t do it
I’m damn foolish you’re damn clueless
Who put you onto Jean?
Your man knew it

[Chorus] [x2]
Oh Lord
Why did you send, the darkness to me?

[Dana Dane]
That’s right party people, Dana Dane is back!
Hurby, behind the board of the twenty-fo’ track machine
Makin sure the beats come out clean
As I tell you this tale of a Christmas scene
It all began in a far off land
Do you know the Drummer Boy? Well I’m the Rapper Man
I wandered and wandered with no main course
Drawn to a campsite by some strange force
Now in this camp lived three wise men
They said, "Dana Dane where have you been?"
They said that they had been expecting me
Told me to kick off my sandals and relax my feet
We started to talk, a lot of time was spent
Tale of how emcees wouldn’t be content
‘til the Christmas spirit, was gone and demolished
And I was the only one who could abolish their plan
So I took a stand!
But they said I must journey across the land
I said listen my friend, I’ll be glad to go
But the sand out there is worse than snow
The first wise man said "Yes, that’s true"
To protect my feet gave me Bally shoes
The second wise man said "Yes, you’re right"
and gave me a Kangol to shade my eyes
The third wise man leaning on a cane
said "Take this mic rapper Dana Dane!"
He said that the mic would help my words
of Christmas cheer be clearly heard

[Dana Dane]
Well I started my journey, at the first light
I travelled, the desert, for a fortnight
I sighed, I tried, the North Star my guide
Pulled my Kangol over my eyes
Took off my Ballys, dumped the sand on the side
Put my Ballys back on and continued my stride
Off I went, through the sand and mist
Takin all types of chances and all kinds of risks
It was Christmas Eve, time was growin short
Then I came upon the place that I had sought
Went up to the door, straight in the palace
Faces were filled with contempt and malice
Up on the stage, what did I see?
That’s right party people - a sucker emcee
Went up on the stage, plugged in my mic
To the sucker emcee I said "Good night~!"
Off he went, he was steamin mad
Talk about relief?! The crowd was glad
I said, "Have no fear - cause I am here
to wish a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"
I continued on, they began to believe
and the Christmas spirit, was soon retrieved
The fingers were poppin, the house cold rockin
Talk about starin?! Girls were cold clockin
Mission complete, I was on my way
Girls in back of me screamin "Dane please stay!"
But I couldn’t! Cause I had done my thing
And as I walked out the door I heard them all sing

[singers]
Sucker emcees, you better watch out!
All emcees, you gotta watch out!
Dana Dane is coming, to town

Dana Dane is coming
Dana Dane is coming
Yes Dana Dane is coming
to town

[Chorus] - X 2
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that

[Hi-C]
I’ma kick one for the treble, two for the bass
I think it’s time for me to slap the snot out ya face
Not with my fist, this time with the beats
I’m tricky, I’m the trickest so I always give treats
Niggaz that’s tweakin’ I’ma reach out and touch ya
Catch ya walkin’ to your car, jump out and cut ya
I’ll stick ya like the butcher, the ex drug pusher
Got in the rap game, to give himself a name
(Now demon used to do me, not gon’ do it no more
God forgive me for me sin, me tryin’ to come up and score)
Hell yeah I want more of the fat funky stuff
They call me Mr. Big Nuts and I can’t get enough
of the lips, the hips, the tits, the backs
A pack of Lifestyles and a big bud sack
The boots, the loot, the tracks that’s fat
Ey yo check it out black, I got it like that

[Chorus]
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that

[Hi-C]
When it comes to gettin’, I gotta get it good
And I’d like to say peace to all my niggaz in the hood
Take me to the swap meet, it’s time to get dressed
I want a t-shirt and some khakis, can’t freak with the Guess
Then I’m gettin’ hungry, wish I had some hot wings
A green Gatorade and a bag of jelly beans
Fuck the jelly beans, I want a peanut butter Twix
The sugar keep me hyper, I need another fix
Later on at night I wanna go to a club
Dip in through the door and get a girl to give me love
Baby it’s a fact that I give love back
While you’re layin’ on your back, this is how I act
Baby let’s chill ‘cause I think I’m in the mood
And after that move (uh-uh-ooh!)
When I’m in the sack I never ever cut no slack
Ey yo check it out black, I got it like that

[Chorus]
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that

[Hi-C]
Hey, before the term is up and I’m through with the gut
I gotta fade the funk to make the girls shake they butt
After this verse that I burst I’m dippin’
Back into the hood to catch a knucklehead slippin’
But since I got time, there’s no need for rushin’
I got at baby girl and the trick still blushin’
Ch-ch-ch-ch, all up by teeth
Ch-ch, she can’t get enough of the beef
So hey, I’ma keep feedin’ it to ya lady
But don’t get addicted it’ll drive yo’ ass crazy
(Hey baby I’ma get you sprung
Soon as I bag your hunny bun, now let me)
Snatch off the wrapper, eat it up, toss it up
If you allergic to the stuff it’ll make ya throw up
Never slippin’ but I’m dippin’ and I’ll soon be back
Come check it out black, I got it like that

[Chorus] - X 2
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that
Tricks on my dick ‘cause my shit so fat
Now nigga don’t ask why, we got it like that

[Big Steve]
Testimony recited off paper
Players take a listen begin the capers
Deep into the mind of a young black baller
Heavy shot caller
Slipping in your crib breaking you off the hardest
Before I start this arsenal of plain fuckin terror
I be the coldest nigga in this rap era
I dare a muthafucka to, (whut) come test
I release shots in tyrany to your chest
Explosive the dossage to your brain
You listening maan, peep the game
Once again it’s on from dusk to dawn
Nigga we ballin, p’poppin, sippin lean when I’m rocking
Thangs never stopping with me and my click
Check my hoes and regulate my bitch
I get deeper than a mind can get sometimes
Lord forgive me I’m getting blown off mine
See I’m just a 22 year old deciple
Looking for the land of riches cuz thats vital
Whose ya idol Granpappy Mafioso
Creeping through your back door nigga if u don’t know
I can go toe to toe, blow for blow
With you weak minded niggaz and ya broke rap flows
So for sho, verbal assault be the hardest
Death can be the only way u can part this
And my part has just begun
I’m high in Texas where I learn my hustle from
For real though, just chill hoe if you boppin
I love them thick yellow bones that be shopping
We hip-hopping, dropping them plats on the shelf
You gots to keep it real nigga so don’t do it yourself
And let me and my click stay grinding
Waitnig for the day when the rolex start shining
Keep reminding cuz Woss Ness go coast to coast
And Pap-daddy be your muthafuckin host
With my lace game I tell it only how I see it
You want the real well so be it you can feel my testimony
My Testimony, testimony, page one for real

[Hook 6X]
Shit just keeps on passing me by

[Intro: Woman]
The same murder
You made our streets into what these people call the killing fields...

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
The motherfucking dust kicker
Who can you trust
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, Before you bust
My name is spoken on the tounges
Of so many foes, Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks
I don’t even go!
Now how the hell do you explain
My claim to fame
From doing flick, To bustin tricks
Out the fuckin frame
Got these bitches on my jock
Niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckas got to duckin from my smokin glock
And bustin niggaz asses just to stay alive
Skinny assed nigga watchin bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I’m livin
I’ma hustler buckin bustas till they die
Now it’s on in the ghetto
You ain’t heard
Niggaz got they AK’s headed for the burbs’
Aiming at the skin head bitches let it rain
Givin them a wet welcome to the house of pain

[Chorus]
In the city, where set by the challenge of racial tension of many levels
(echos)
Where the level of violence is higher this year than last (echos)
Our city is a warzone...

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Yo I’m hunting down this nigga
And he knows so he’s stressin
He better count his blessins
And get ready for this lesson
Cuz Stretch gonna teach him
When he reach him
With the mack,
And lay that ass down on his motherfucking back jack
Slack is something that a nigga don’t take
His mom’s run the church so i’ma see her at his fuckin wake
Make way!
The nigga payed me the other day
I’m walkin with my son
And the nigga had somethin to say
Hey! the nigga tried to diss
Boy he got it twisted
He shoulda watched Amerikaz most
I’m listed
For killing motherfuckers like him
So i’ma bring him to the house of pain
And kill him with a grin
Flim flam God DAMN
I’m not the one to choke him
And smoke him
i’m gonna smack him with my fuckin gun
Son you make your last mistake
And i don’t know your name
But welcome to the house of pain

[Chorus]
In the second such case in recent memory
A Bronx woman saying target a murder
In the shooting death of her daughter over a crack habit

(Biggie coughing)

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
Huh
The country bud got me chocking
I’m on a mission til the point that motherfuckers think i’m smoking
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie
With the eight shot flip
Got a extra clip for that extra shit
Don’t you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling
Is all the part of drug dealing
A born gangsta
My daddy was a thug
Had a 38
With a hollow point slug
So when he licks shots
Niggaz drop quicker than a Bootlegger
Sells his Liquor
A little nigga tryna squeeze 22’s
In my Reebok shoes
Payin dues while kids was on there one’s and two’s
But
Now i’m much older, colder fuck a holdsta
Got them Mack 11’s swingin from my shoulda
It’s a damn shame, I gotta put my momma through this strain
I’m living in the house of pain

[Outro: Various news reporters]
He reportedly tried to hide behind the parked car
And then  pulled his life
Before he was killed

Some hostage in Brooklyn threatened with death...

They were kidnapped and held to rest and threatened with death

They hurt us, humiliated us, took us for granted, stole from us...

[Slush "The Villain"]

Now just imagine when the orgasims kick in

[Chorus]

[Slush "The Villain"]
To all them girls that used to diss me

Prepare for the battle, prepare for the war

Your life’s on the line so I’ma take yours
So who wanna blood dance with me?

Cold blooded killers in my LockDown click

Street Fighter 3 like this scar on my arm

Yo make your first move, so what’s in gon’ be?

Yo rock what you got. Block what you shot

‘Nuff warriors here to fight, choose one
The best of the best will be the champion
Whose world is this after all?
Capcom living with LockDown forever y’all
?????? sees the violence and death
?????? so ain’t ready yet
If a pack they ain’t ready step up with all you got
With the fighters who ain’t ready take your regular
spot
So what? Come down before it’s too late to stop
Tryin to front like you was kids of the block
Step too close kid you might get shot
Only one master’s goin straight to the top
One false move your whole game gets blocked
Only one master’s goin straight to the top

Yeah, yo
You’re about to get your life with something you wish
you wouldn’t
It’s too late, you gotta borrow what you wish you
couldn’t
Pass the first stage, you thought you could live it
Now you just realized you never could survive it
Dealin with cold blooded assassinators
Decapitate your body give the food to alligators
You needa put your power over here it’s much greater
It’s either you push start or try again later
It’s all about the confidence bet they don’t cater
You got no time to talk to the player haters
I guess on ?? kid will leave your body critical
Talkin bout real street thugs and big criminals
Now you’re helpless all the way to the finish
Where you can practice, come back and get with it
You can’t bite my hits, the sky’s no limit
Anything distant yo it’s Infinite

Make your first move, so what’s in gon’ be?
You’re trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3

[Chorus: 2x]
What kinda woman you is, what kinda man you like
What kinda shit you like to do to make you feel alright
What kinda car you like to drive, what kinda job you got
What kinda shit you like to buy, what kinda fit you rock

You go to school or you finished, drive a beamer or a bentley
You ratchet all alone or you just home independent
A business or a dentist, a dancer or you be trickin
Not a big difference I just love women who tryna get it
From the bathroom, to the living room, to the kitchen
She be cookin she be cleanin hold it down when ya up in prison
Apartment, condo, or a house, how you livin,
You stay up in the A so you like to shop at Lennox
You keep yo mouth closed cuz you don’t like em in yo business
you in love with just one nigga, no they got plenty
You faithful and you taken you don’t like fuckin with many
Like a nigga in true religion jeans don’t do the dishes
Drank ciroc or that goose, a photo or a coupe
Ain’t even gotta tell her she bad know she the truth
Facebook and twitter she still do it bigger
ain’t even gotta trip worry bout nare nigga

[Chorus: 2x]

You hate hoes in yo business huh
playin on phones like children that shit be sickenin huh
Yo man broke as the fuck you independent huh
you tell em fuck who you want
you don’t be trippen huh that’s what I’m talkin bout
I just like a woman like to keep herself together
It’s sumthin bout a woman who suck it and suck it better
Hands down you ain’t fuckin with her cuz she better
One of them girl rappers got a bad bitch swagger
Like a nigga in the streets don’t like puttin up with his shit
think he fuckin with a hoe he might be cookin up a brick
Keep yo friends out yo mix, they’ll fuck up your relationship
I call her trina when I’m leanin cuz I patient sip
when she ride it like my fiyah cuz the way she dip
Don’t get mad give her a kiss like the way she trip
When I’m rockin the stage she rep my single
With me put a cup in the air if you single with me

[Chorus: 2x]

[Chorus x2: Future]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Fuck ya dead homies, run ya bread homie
Got some lead for me, I’m on Artesia
Parked in my Beamer bumping my own shit
I’m focused, they stuck on that dull shit
Livin’ for that True Religion is broke shit
I can spend that on a Mac with a long clip
Fly in that Benz but you hide in that Focus
My nigga just focus, I’m tryin’ to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner gets stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to domin’
That’s somebody’s son but a war to be won
Baby either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab
So I shot at him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin’ in public

[Chorus x2: Future]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
What means the world to you?
Is it a fast life, money and clothes?
Probably fuckin’ these hoes
And what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won’t hug your bitch, when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shootin’, no practice
Been tourin’, whip foreign, coupe crashin’
Still bangin’ 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police" they won’t catch me
My feature too pricey, don’t ask me
Go hard ‘til Goyard on my baggage
He mad we won’t fight, I’m gon’ tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clappin’
Kids crying, still snipin’, no lackin’

[Chorus x4: Future]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
I don’t have a reason, oh but I
I’ll get in your mind
I keep you loaded and ready right here beside of me
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on you
I’ll pull up on your mind

(Intro)
Love ‘em all
Haha gotta be one of them Baby Blue joints
Turn it up a notch
Let me see them speakers rock
Choclair featuring Mr. Mims
Aiyo Mims, whos this joint going out to?

(Chorus)
This is for my street misses
The one’s who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my jeep misses
This is for the haters (woooah)
The ones that floss with no doe
We loves them all you know how we love ‘em all

(Choclair)
You know we say we wanna do is bring it to the streets
And realize that its too far
So wanna bring it where they are where they are
You all niggaz at home doin’ dishes with their ma (yo)
Or back playin ball wit pa’ I don’t hate
But its love and im only gonna roll with real thugs
Who show love to niggas who came from nothing and rose above
Who broke their balls to be a star
Now they shine bright (no the stores got a brighter light)
See it’s funny to me when people wanna go bad-talk-me
But in a few years they be puttin’ chips in your skin
To get your ID
Yet you suckers wanna hate on me? (get your priorities right)
I don’t fight I sit back with Cogn-i-ac
Spark the Cohiba bright, give you more
When it’s a Sauve Dawg thing you been looking for ???
Chocs is the funk that’ll stank
That pumps your radio
That pumps the G’s into my bank
Take your whole 4, fuck the plank
Wookie niggas try to step up but Chocs he pulls rank
Chop you on tour, take your rewards
Your uniform’s plain, your stripe’s been torn
Reppin’ for the T-O-R-O-N-T-O T Dot O Dot Dot (fades into Chorus)

(Chorus)
This is for my street misses
The one’s who like to creep misses
In the back seat of my jeep misses
This is for the haters (woooah)
The ones that floss with no doe
We loves them all you know that we love ‘em all (yo yo yo yo yo)

(Choclair)
I’m just trying to live
Only take what you trying to give
I won’t wait, I’ll just take for a ride in the 6
I won’t wait, You ain’t the only one I’m tryin’ to hit
Plenty other chicks eyeing the whip (you know)
I’m gonna take ‘em and scoop ‘em up
Especially when the roof is up
Either hop in the coup or truck
It’s all the same just dont play no games like
(Sean I really don’t do this much)
I’m not a brandy man
I’m in your dreams like candy man
Plus, I only touch girls named Candyland
When im in candy land sweet enough to eat it up
Like candied yams, call me handy man
I never take chickits to tandy land
I never Hawk chicks like Atlanta man
I’ll take a girl out on a family plan
Thats why these girls can’t stand me mannn (fades)

(Chorus - repeat 2X)

This is for my ballars my hustlers
My my my brothers who like like my sisters
Who love it beneath the covers
For my thugs my soldiers who try to get them rovers
Who won’t stop for nothin’ you want hits we bust ‘em

(Mr. Mims)
Now being the type of man that I am, I just
Don’t coo wheather you come through with a crew
Makin’ noise so they boost ya
Cause niggas just cruise for a loose
Cause they think what they drop is the shot like a shooter
But I ain’t what you used to
I’m out for millions like I’m Brewster
T Dot T Dot
Watch out, the heat that we bring, Sauve Dawg spread your wings

(Chorus - repeat 3X)


(Outro)
Mims yeah private party 2
What’s up y’all, It’s gotta be Kid Kut the voice of the vibe
Check it out, the party’s jumpin’, ladies bumpin’
Fellas is havin a crazy time
So drop us a line at www.babybluesoundcrew.com
Cause you know we comin’ to your town to get down
We get down c’mon (baby blue dog in backround)

[Chorus 2x: Mr. Sancho]
Do you remember (member)
When we used to be down (be down)
Together as one for some fun
Then I’m down, then I’m out

[Verse 1]
Come on baby let me see you lick the tip
Gotta be a little wet before I’m in the clit
I got your top down baby, squeeze them tits
Cause I want a little bounce when you wiggle it
Shake it baby cause I wanna kick it and I made it
Where your honey bunny be, he won’t hate it
He’ll just wanna play with it
Blow you out like a candle stick
Cause that’s how it is in this biz
Fulfillin’ women’s fantasy’s and movin’ to another trick
I know how it is in this biz
And ridin’ with no jimmy ‘cause I’m cautious of another kid
Easily she’s movin’ south, easily she pulls it out
Easily she opens her mouth, I gladly let it all out

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
How many licks does it take till you get to the cream
of you dreams? Do you know what I mean?
In between the sheets producin’ all this heat
Making you for weak, going at it for a week
You scream, so you thought, sittin’ in the dark
We about to embark, but don’t love me from my heart
is small, don’t abuse it or you lose it
Don’t get to attached and don’t get shot like you did
Only suffer, make your life tougher
And you’ll regret hookin’ up with this thugsta
Think of me when you take your back seat
X is the best in the west girl you gotta confess
Yes, I relive all my stress
Comin’ back for more, put your heart to the test
Nevertheless you gotta address mami your blessed
And you know I really love it when I bust into your chest, yes

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Many gorgeous ladies on these Diego streets
Hey pretty Mexi come an kiss me, come an roll mami
Cause I’m a soldier see come and bone mami
Roll up and blow some tree’s, that’s all it’s gonna be
Don’t get mad homey, cause your hyna looking at me
Chose me over you and it’s plain to see
You better stop asking question’s cause I’m not here to threatin’
Your relationship cause I’m teaching a lesson
Sometimes I don’t know what to do when your not by my side
Sometimes I don’t know what to do when I can’t see your face on my mind
But I do know what to do when I need some bump and grind
Gotta take a trip to your house when your honey’s out
So that I can hit and split, put it in you and out

[Chorus 2x]

I’m the product of a by-gone age
back when the fashion was high-top fades
the motif was cocaine, rope chains and gold teeth
808 dope beats, kick a box - no seat
5-star rims, jet black tints
windbreaker suits, windmills, backspins
Carharts, Timberlands, and Motorola pagers
Starter jackets: either Georgetown or Oakland Raiders
Lunchroom freestyle battles, high-schoolers
fadin’ off of OE or Crooked-I coolers
Mexican bags and mescaline tabs
Brand Nube’s at the Muse so we catchin’ the PATH
Back when underground radio kept North Jersey bumpin’
Teddy Ted and Special K, Kevin, Keith and Dirty Dozen
Who could be on BLS
who’s king of the mixtapes?
Red Alert on KISS-FM cuttin’ like a switchblade
Take a look around, Great Adventures of Slick Rick
Funky Technician, Strictly Business
I would say that things ain’t the way they used to be
but fuck that - them days are gone now and ain’t never gonna come back
I ain’t got no jewels or ice, I’m played out
I spit ‘cause I’m nice on the mic, I’m played out
I didn’t blow up overnight, I’m played out

(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

I’ve been doin’ it since back in the days, I’m played out
I’m not up on the latest craze, I’m played out
I’m still strugglin’ to get paid, that’s played out

(**scratched** )My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Yo, It’s a known fact
Foul Mouth Jerk’s a throwback
Still stuck on that old rap, the pro-black
now somebody give my broke-ass a soul clap
Still walk with my hand on my jewels, holdin’ my Bozack
Only smoke Sess, Cheeba, or Buddha-bless cause I’m def
dumb, hype, chilly and super-fresh
kickin’ the ballistics, drop science, and flow the funky shit
I don’t holla at bitches, man, I kick it to the honey-dips
with the lovliest, girl you know my flavor
fuck a cell phone, hit me on my Skypager
so I can hit the skinz, I got somethin for ya kittycat
latex for safe sex, pocket full of Jimmy hats
Smokin’ on the nicklesack
In my fishin hat, if it’s not my shearling
I probably rock a Triplefat
I can tell you on my tip, ‘cause you know what time it is
I’m clockin’ crazy dollars, so I push the flyest whips..
Naaaaaahhhhh
Ya’ll suckas can’t fade my Cross Colours
so step off before I catch wreck and cause ruckus
I’m jettin’, I’m proofin’, I’m ghost, I’m Swayze
I’m peace an’ I’m Audi 5000, Baby!
Got gold and platimum plaques, I’m played out
I’m lucky just to be on wax, I’m played out

When I rock, man, I stick to the facts, that’s played out
(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Don’t got a single that’s hot in the club, played out

I ain’t a damn pimp or a thug, played out
I’m just glad not to be locked up, that’s played out
(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Still got the boombox that only plays cassettes

Still bumpin PRT, Kris, Kane, Finesse
Chub Rock, King Sun in my tape deck
still watch New Jersey Drive on VHS
still got that ol’ gold in the chokehold
still rock a b-boy stance in photos
still playin’ Tyson Punchout and Tecmo Bowl
Ain’t got no Sean John, Phat Farm or Esco clothes
Got my Champion hoodie, still wear Girbauds
Rock a Ewing hi-tops, got two pairs of those
Still rock ‘em untied with two dumb fat laces
Still hit 48 bars, no hooks or catch-phrases
Real kool kats still dance when I rap
cause I go back to the wall, it’s wack to do that
so fuck anyone who says that I’m past my prime ‘cause I get better with age
like a glass of wine, but still I’d be rich
if I had a dime for everytime, I wished I could go back in time
with my fattest rhymes and make the platnium mine
but I still probably wouldn’t be satisfied
I’M PLAYED OUT!
I’m literally played out

(**scratched**) My life is played out... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Damn right you’re played out!
You better put some fuckin’ spinners on that song or somethin;
Jesus Christ dude! Why don’t you take your broke ass back to ‘93
and do a St. Ides commercial or some shit...?

Played out motherfucker

[Verse 1: Dominator]
You got the makings of a lover, mama make me wanna studder
I wonder what your body looks like, under the covers
You’se a big flirt
But you ain’t no hoe
I see you peeking out the window
At my carton
Call me, confess a feelin’
Don’t be afraid
The love I give to you will make you do what I say
Anyways (Anyways)
I’m always free on Sundays
Eating hot menudo, cool though, stumblin’ down the hallways
Orale
Baby girl, you know my-a stylo
We do it with class, y yo no soy un chavalito
Give me a minute
No, give me twenty-five
I got my homie Capone-E, outside, in the ride
We gonna roam the calles
For a little while
Bump a few oldie rollas
And make the heinas smile
Then I’ll be back
To make it with you
Make it hump all night
Play the game, but I’m no fool

Chorus: Dominator
I wanna make you say, "Yeah-i-yeah"
You’re beautiful baby, one of a kind
And everything will be ok
We’ll be together forever, just you and I
Can you make me say, "Yeah-i-yeah"
Cause there will never be another for me
I wanna be with you always
Cause you were meant for me
I’m dreaming casually

[Verse 2: Mr. Capone-E]
Don’t trip, mija
It’s all said and done
Now when Capone-E comes through, I’ll be the one
Don’t cry (Don’t cry)
And listen to this rola
I’ll be right around the corner, so look over your shoulder
I told ya
You’re the one for me
Kick it back with Dominator, I’ll be home around three
Sincerly yours
Bumpin’ The Commadores
Like the escorts
I’ll take ya on my tour
Flight after flights
Without no fights
Eatin’ all night
Company ain’t no price
I love the way that you
Talk to me
I love the way that you’re still calling me
Baby please
Trust is number one
Now when I vuela the girl
It’s all about fun
So as I cruise
Don’t go away
Trust this gangster and this gangster’s here to stay

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Dominator]
She said she’s shy (Shy...)
Cause it’s her very first time
She thinks I’m fine
So tonight’s the night
I’m might
Light up a candle
And turn off the light
Mi amor, mi cholita
She puts up no fight
Firme, suave
Long black hair
Down to your back, make a vato wanna stare
Finally
Under the covers
I love you mija
You got the makings of a lover

Bridge: Dominator
You got the makings of a lover (Makings of a lover)
You got a star that’ll make a man to walk a mile
Just to see you
Or just to hold ya hand
Spit game to ya
I’ll make you understand

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Capone-E]
That’s right, mija
This little song’s for you
And no matter what I say
This gangster’s here to say
Sincerly yours
Mr. Capone-E
Oh!

but I ain’t stuntin that - I gotta keep it movin

[Chorus - Blak Jak]
You can find me in the club, posted in the back
rollin up the purp, and I’m sippin on the Yak
and I’m just bobbin my head - bobbin my head
(bobbin my head, bobbin my head)
And you can catch me in a whip, cruisin with a chick
with the top let down, ridin hard gettin litted
and I’m just bobbin my head - bobbin my head
(bobbin my head, bobbin my head)

[Verse 2 - Blak Jak]
So now I two - step groovy, lookin like a playa

the club scene packed, niggaz steppin on my feet
young girls on the flo’walkin out to the beat
and you know niggaz on the lean, rockin with the snap
why the G’s at the bar bobbin heads to the track
crew thick in this bitch - got my goons right beside me
I just came to chill so you know where you can find me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Blak Jak]
And you can catch me in a fly whip with a bad bitch
ridin through the hood, gettin that corn bread and cabbage
I gots to have it I’m tryna live lavish
I’m off in Miami - spend money like it’s a habit
let the top drop, while the wheels turn
down on south beach let the reefer burn
bumpin Trick Dolla"Only In America"
gas on my chest so I’m comin thru ya area
music too loud, couldn’t hear what she said
I ain’t Shawna but I too was ‘gettin head’
and if I had some I would shake my dreads
but I don’t so I’m in the drivers seat, bobbin my head

[Chorus]

.
.
[Leem]
I’m sick of bein nobody so I pull a jack move in a hurry
Got my name on the board, now these niggaz know me
as the one who can get the job done
Anyone that’ll step will regret that’s a bet I’m a threat
to little wannageez and they families
Liftin weight with them cooked up ‘caine keys
I see my niggaz on the streets runnin backwards
Tryin to get what we cain’t, cause we captured
Late night deals goin down, watch it pop
I couldn’t see myself gettin dropped for a rock
So I’m forced to choose another hobby
I keep on searchin for employment, cause slangin ain’t for everybody
I got dogs that can make thangs happen
We roll slow, lookin for niggaz who nappin
I’m strapped and we cappin and ready to blast
on the first slippin nigga cause I’m sick of bein last

Chorus: repeat 2X

It ain’t no room for mistakes in the streets, watch yo’ back

[Mad Doc]
The good old days, vanished right before my eyes, check my new disguise
in a WORLD of psychopaths and compromise
Learned to shut my fuckin mouth while I’m watchin scenes
and let that fool weigh himself on them triple beams
That blind rage got my back fade
But maybe this whole new world of jackin, will introduce a grave
I don’t know but all I see is struggle
Every road that a nigga crossin, seems he’s causin trouble
I keep a hard frame, but never losin my game
in these streets, a nigga broke with a cracked frame
For my brothers sellin them sacks, keep sellin on
Cause I know, all you want is livin better homes

[Leem]
It ain’t no room for mistakes in the streets, watch yo’ back
Cause niggaz are gettin served with the backstreet gat
It’s a fact that I lack qualities of your insecurities
Niggaz how you figure you could fuck wit deez?
It’s the G’s that I stack that I wish that I could
It’s why I keep strivin and strayin from the good
So should, you have, to hustle for your shit
Remember there’s another nigga strugglin to get
higher than you, he’s flyer than you, he’s tryin your crew
So whatcha gonna do?  Thangs done caught up witchu
Now you’re faced with a cocked back twenty-two
Can’t escape, so the slug penetrates you
Slowly fell into the devil all you hear is screams
Niggaz dyin for they backstreet fuckin dreams

Chorus

[Mad Doc]
They got me stressin, got my lungs filled full of smoke
Smoke sailin through my body like a sailboat
Captain of the ship so let it float
And on the backstreets a nine is what we tote
Like monkey in the middle got me squiggin on them weak vibes
And time, keeps on tickin in my head, bout to pop my mind
Gotta get with slower jobs cause we lower class
Still they broke nast’ fearsome niggaz, fuck they ass
Fool move on, just float on, just move on slow
We buildin with the fuckin GODS, I thought they knowed
Hate to break the black thing while I’m slangin ‘caine
So I remain cold in my mind and watch my aim
Fiends gettin blowed out they frame, slain
And watchin em fall like a tragedy, it’s sad
But I can’t stop the fuckin mad in me, it’s bad
I’m raisin gotta have my money flowin like a river
So if you a victim better float like a bobbin nigga
It’s ninety-fo’, hope you struts from them green tips
And I done blasted on a nigga, let the blood drip
Trapped in this fuckin game amazin puzzles
I got a ten and a NIM with a fuckin muzzle
My mind’s flickin to the silent rage
of the backstreets I pray for the grave
for the luxury of a suite

Sacala, que ya viene, esa nena, nena linda..

Sacala, que ya viene, esa nena, nena linda..

Anoche te vi bailando solo
Sin una mujer que te acompane
Pienso que eres un cobarde
Por no pedir la mano para que baile

Sudaste, te intimidatse
Cuando la viste ni te arrimaste
Mientras que tu piensas y dudas
Maria baila con un cualquiera...

Sacala hermano ponte a bailar mira que te llama maria...

Pidele, pidele la mano hermano
No tengas miedo, no seas cobarde
Si no la sacas a bailar
Otro vendra y juntos se van
Juntos se van, juntos se van
Otro vendra y juntos se iran
Sacacla hermano ponte a bailar
Mira que te llama maria..

[Chorus]
Sacala hermano ponte a bailar mira que te llama maria

[Chorus]
Sacala, que ya viene, esa nena, nena linda...

[E-A-Ski talking]
Hell yeah...
E-A-Ski, CMT track...ha ha ha
Yeah Bullys Wit Fullys part 3
Messy Marv, Guce, Fillmoe’, Hunters Point, it don’t stop, let’s go

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
I’m switchin’ lanes with them stunnas on my face
Chop in the trunk, wally on my waist
Back in the game nigga feelin’ like Mase
Red J Jonas with the red shoe lace
Deuces on the load, rocks in my load
The ice in my mouth keep my Nextel froze
Have you ever seen a scrape with the Lamborghini doors
Bitch I thizz and play with my nose

[Guce]
The girls, the girls they love me
It’s the project lover
But I’m gang banger, and a drug smuggler
Gucey Guce, dope boy with the cake mix
I’m naked with it in the kitchen doin’ late shift
See I been bout it, other niggaz rap about it
If you got it cuz, then blood better ask about it
We in the drama, bangin’ the hammers, orangutans
Goin’ bananas in the game, throwin’ up the gang
Clyde Carson \xc2\x96 Chorus:
When I roll up, streets show love
I just wanna be on the block with my thugs
I just wanna sit in the drop on my dubs
Open up the doors and turn the beat up, cause
I’m from the ghetto baby, I’m from the hood
When in my ghetto baby, I know I’m good

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
These niggaz got toolies but that ain’t no heat
I’ll slap one of you niggaz like a E-A-Ski beat
I had these Girbauds on full bout a week
Ya boy look grimy but the money look sweet
You got me fucked up, bitch this the Bay
Me and every niggaz do this shit all day
I’ll lay everybody down in the room
But whatever I do I’ma stay a tycoon

[Guce]
Aaaa....
What you know bout bricks and traps
Bullys Wit Fullys is a gang in all black and strapped
I’m not a rapper, I’m a street nigga
I’m so hungry with this heat tryin’ to eat nigga
Real talk we in this bitch buyin’ out the bar
Talk shit I’ll make this cold iron hot to yo jaw
Represent gangstas, two step hustlers
Hands in the air you gettin’ cookies on sight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Messy Marv]
Stunna on mine, and all on a hoe
Richmond, Vallejo, the City, and the O
Gang dog Blood, oh what you didn’t know
Good weed in my mouth, mac on the floor
You ridin’ with a star, bitch feelin’ like whoa
She feelin’ like stay but I’m feelin’ like go
And I ain’t got nothin’ against the new bay
I used to ride through with Fab nigga back in the day

[Guce]
You already know Bullys Wit Fullys is so hood
Guce and Tay now we got Mess, the nigga so hood
Pill Music got you sort of like some wet wet
You in the club gang bangin’ throwin’ up ya set
Me and Mess dog runnin’ the game
600 back to back dog huggin’ the lane
Yeah this .50 Cal., make it worth ya while
Everybody goin’ dumb off a half of pound

[Chorus]

[King Mez]
This how you end it
 
Uh, a young King, always I had known it
but didn’t know what to call it, maybe I telephone it
I just knew that I was different, wasn’t livin for moments
{?} Gotti’s tone, I ain’t, nobody’s clone
I mean, I want that throne, it ain’t gotta be the main one
Just as long as don’t nobody livin got the same one
So I keep utensils closed, my pen is my brain’s gun
Momma told me, "When you ‘bout yo’ business, boy you bring one"
So, this is the close as you get to seein me unprepared
Because I won’t be, so lyrically tryna fold me
My writtens is called a fractional, slippin is called subtraction
My mission is causin action, these country niggas is slackin
Yeah, do all that crackin when they was callin ‘em wack
And cheatin all of his raps and distraction writin in classes
Now you see how they actin, see and feel all that passion
All them cameras flashin, couldn’t even imagine how I feel
...Growing into my title
No way, from any rival, they auto think of survival
Because they know that I’m libel to hop up on tracks and embarrass ‘em
Faces be avacado, honestly homey I know
If you ain’t got no pain, you will not understand like I do
I won’t do this in vain, it ain’t no blood on me and my crew
I won’t be part of chains, I’m too intelligent to follow
I got heart, you niggas hollow! Just call me Rollow
 
[Phonte]
Yeah...it’s Phontigga
King Mez, waddup? Young Khrysis on the beat
And nigga, I cut yo’ shit in half ‘cause I ain’t feel like waitin
 
Uh, wack verses, I don’t own one
Bullshit is not in my possesion, and that’s without a question
Word to Kweli and Khrysis dawg, +I’m On One+
Sprint like a Kenyan, I’m in it for the long run
Ask me for your opinion, we all got a strong one
I’ve been livin with ‘em since I made song one
back in ‘99, but for praise I do not live
Spit it like Yoda, a FUCK I do not give
I’m on a high still, I’m overpowerin
Phontigga towerin, all over you niggas like the Eiff-el
I will kill this, still it’s rap niggas
claimin they sick with no symptoms of illness
You clear for work, hoe nigga, go and get a job
or hit the net and cry about it - fuck it, get a blog!
I be sangin but with rap, shit I’m still involved
Make ‘em say, "Chu’uch~! ?Mostenveur? Synagogue" 
This is what I’m in it for, I can taste the dreamers
I pace the ring, gettin ready for the title, wait-
I’m co-starring, sparrin with King Mez 
I show love to the young Gs’, they help me stay in fightin shape
North Carolina is back on the bih’ness
‘til all competition get back on the benches
Take off my Fedora, put back on the fitted
Like this y’all, this fall, I’m back on you niggas!
Eh-hahaha, yeah...

[Jarren Benton]
Hopsin put me on in this bitch, I wish you the best fam
I was thinking ‘bout murking the whole staff of Def Jam
Niggas sleeping on me like a muthafucking craftmatic
Counted me out, guess these faggots bad at they mathematics
Cursing God like "why the fuck You take my brother?"
Prescription pills to coke, guess I love the feel of these uppers
Arguing niggas cause Pac wasn’t in my top five
You don’t fuck with me hoe, you die from carbon monoxide
Fuck the small talk, my blood pressure boiling
If I wanna shoot this shit, I pop this pistol at the toilet
A new year, fuck this nice guy shit
If you ain’t rocking with my clique, nigga bite my dick (blegh)
And Lord knows I keep something by the torso
As long as my [?] fuck y’all award show
Praying on my downfall, want my soul to leave the earth
Put a hole in a nigga’s chest just like a Yeezy shirt
I’mma feed the needy first
Ill nigga, need a nurse
I ain’t forget you bitches just spat on me when you seen me hurt
Hey we done been to hell, I’m wishing my niggas well
Threw my nigga something on his books when he was sitting in jail
Time flies like looking good, nigga [?]
Cashing checks doing the Soulja Boy, nigga youuu!
Niggas dying over repping they turf
Never know, so I’m praying with my Tec in the church

So they praying on my downfall
(Nigga praying on my downfall)
Bout to knock a nigga crown off
(Knock a nigga crown off)
Oh Lord I wish a nigga would
(Wish a nigga would)
Cup of Henny got me feelin’ good
(Got me feelin’ good)
Oh what a feelin’ dog
(What a feelin’ dog)
Bout to count a hundred million dog
(A hundred million dog)
Throw it up
Niggas reppin’ they turf
Never know
So I’m praying with my tec in the church

[Locksmith]
I was told to bring a tec to the church and a bible to the trap
The only method that’s vital for survival is a strap
My little cousin was murdered I was stifled by the act
So when these niggas yap about violence I’m biased to they raps
I’m here to rescue you
[?] spilling out of your breaths of truth
Only benefits who is honest, that’s how you execute
Watch who you pillow talk with, that’s how they retribute
These bitches use social media like a confession booth
Stay to myself, tread light, and keep my standards up
I was in a space financially where my hands were cuffed
I was in a space creatively where I had enough
Started releasing the music I made for myself so now the fans rush
Sunday mornings at St. John’s in Bay View
Young adolescents distorted we had the same view
Dice games in the basement repping our turf
Bumping Strange, you could say we had a tech in the church

[Jarren Benton]
So they praying on my downfall
(Nigga praying on my downfall)
Bout to knock a nigga crown off
(Knock a nigga crown off)
Oh Lord I wish a nigga would
(Wish a nigga would)
Cup of Henny got me feelin’ good
(Got me feelin’ good)
Oh what a feelin’ dog
(What a feelin’ dog)
Bout to count a hundred million dog
(A hundred million dog)
Throw it up
Niggas reppin’ they turf
Never know
So I’m praying with my tec in the church

[Joyner Lucas]
Okay, I’m ready to die
Brrra, you waving that tec in the sky
You ready or not?
I enter the block leave all of you dead in a box
Who the fuck is you, Pac?
The fuck is you Biggie? I never get love from the city
I never got shit, just a couple a titties
A couple a pennies and plenty of haters and tricks
Go fix your mouth before you get back handed
I’m from a bottled of rap planet where these hoes think I’m half-Spanish
The truth is I’m an Afghan, I’m half-black but I act frantic
I grab Xanax and pop Vikes and then make a crack sandwich
I’m mad at you
You would never keep your word, you’re such a crook
I can’t trust you, you’ll say anything for a couple bucks
That’s fucking nuts
Word to Karen Civil, you fucking slut
You’s just a thot and your mouth is as big as your twat
I know who is you not, fuck you and that Louis you got
With my money taking vacations and sucking noodles and cocks
They got proof you a fraudulent fuck with a Vince Carter neck
Crooked weave and some funny tits
And the face of a lumpy dick, my nigga fuck this bitch
Shit, I hope my 50k was worth it
Or your pimping days are murdered, you done bit the blade on purpose
I know this gon’ make you nervous
Who the fuck did you encourage?
Hillary Clinton ain’t gon’ like this, she’s fanning next to a serpent
I’m standing next to your merchant
Writing curses in cursive all over your fucking hearses
Get froggy, you’s just a hermit
Bitch go get your fucking hair did
How old is that shit?
I should wrap my dick around your neck and keep choking that shit, bitch

[Jarren Benton]
So they praying on my downfall
(Nigga praying on my downfall)
Bout to knock a nigga crown off
(Knock a nigga crown off)
Oh Lord I wish a nigga would
(Wish a nigga would)
Cup of Henny got me feelin’ good
(Got me feelin’ good)
Oh what a feelin’ dog
(What a feelin’ dog)
Bout to count a hundred million dog
(A hundred million dog)
Throw it up
Niggas reppin’ they turf
Never know
So I’m praying with my tec in the church

[Mnmsta]
now it’s mandatory that I touch bases on this subject
and I don’t really care who gets offended or upset
about these females and their attitude towards us
some act stuck up, others try to ignore us
but me, I ain’t with that funny style shit
when it comes to these hoes I let ‘em know from the git
I ain’t trying what you want or you say that you deserve a
bitch slow your roll before you go any further
the name’s Mster, baby and I’m smooth as silk sheets
game comes out the mouth everytime that I speak
so back up, cause all I got is one thing in mind
if you ain’t on top, then I’ma hit it from behind
Cause I been macking hoes since day one, get the picture
I holla at your homegirl if I see she’s thicker
that’s the problem oh hell I’m just tryin to kick me a fact
save that attitude for someone else

[Mnmsta - chorus]
Cause I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
you need what?
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
check this out
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
say what say what say what
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
whatever
bitch, I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
yeah, I did what?
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
you seen me with who?
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
anyways
bitch, I ain’t tryin’ to hear that

[Mnmsta]
there was one female in particular that really pissed me off
so sit back and listen as I start this one off
her name was Erica, 5’4, brown skin and thick
she had the kind of body that I’ll never forget
it was on when we hooked up
she told me come over
sled to her pad and drama’s all I told her
shoulda known better, she was one in ammount
that’s why anytime I hit, when I was done I was out
a few months passed by and I had to pick and choose
words grand to my other hoes so I coulda lose
but trying to fuck mines off
but you better think again
Cause I’m quick to bust ya bubble and start macking on your friends
I’m on point with my game so what’s oughta twist me
the way I put it down, trick you always gonna miss me
so keep that in mind before you think of getting near that
then save that drame for somebody else

[Mnmsta - chorus]
Cause I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
I don’t know her
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
don’t ask me
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
what phone number?
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
uhm
bitch, I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
who seen me?
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
wasn’t me
I ain’t tryin’ to hear that
anyways
bitch, I ain’t tryin’ to hear that

[Mnmsta]
yo, the moral to the story is, trust no hoes
I treat ‘em like ants cause they comes and they go
so with that in mind day nothing they can tell me
it’ll take more than just trying to overwhelm me
Cause I see right through ‘em like my vision’s X-ray
game’s on deck, all I do is push play
so peep this, as I run game like a sport
and hit more holes than Tiger Woods on the golf course
from the thickests to the air ones
light skin to dark
gotta hit it in the bed, in the ride and in the park
Cause some of these racks tend to think they all that
tryin’ to talk shit I’m talkin’ mines right back
so you can shake if you want cause I ain’t the one to chase ya
get an attitude then I’m quick to replace ya
all they want is something from you
there it is dary
the money for their nails, to go shopping or their hair
but fuck that, hook me up with something for a change
or my other hoes will do it for me and they won’t complain
so I’ma sit back with the beer and the sack
and don’t be fucking up my high with your drama
Cause I ain’t trying to hear that

New face, new identity, Scaramanga Shallah
Fresh out the Swiss clinic, word up
My man Goldfinghaz hit me

[Chorus]
Fame, name changes depending on the route
Shipping it out, sipping the stout, winning no doubt
Rocking Helly Hansen, golden Polo, Roley swollen
Nolan, holding new cards, shining iced jewelry
Only get from Wu Wear, Nike and Polo matching
Over fat beats, Scaramanga Goldfinghaz stay doing damage

Yeah, my team gleam bally, sheen rally to get beam badly
Lastly after we blast self-esteem had me at mach ten
Asking the ATM for the jacksons, action, foyer mayhem
Like judge well in the club, fell in love with the triple dice
Scara’ iced down like a pharaoh, reading moves like tarot
Precise, getting narrowed down selection, fuel injection expedition
Follow a legend, key low, cee-low seven in a row
Won eleven kilo, reload then man the nugget five pound
Emperor royal crown, rugged sound dominator
Honour divine faces, a line of nine dime Asians
Work cut down as lines you rhymed stone ages
Fine tones blazes, shine all places like World Trade Center
Pearls blazed in em, girls play in em
French cut, curls, braids I hit em, waves go for
Hurl venom, I spit em, rap excelsior [???] get loafers 
Go for soft Dior sweaters, arson with letters
Varsity larceny sparking these Berettas

[Chorus x2]

Niggas slow up, see me getting finger rolls
Roll with GP 30, see a murder with a street blower
The deep throw up inner consciousness, tribe and shit
Keep the .45 live, divine Mecca, Scaramanga wet a letter
Dial \xc2\x91H’ for homicide, bombers glide in a downer ride
Shine, apply side to side, E&B; poison the Hennessy
And enemies bend with these, smoother professor maneuvers
Under pressure blue coupe millennia, E-NY to Virginia
Took many a pot sale, armed well so spark well, links
Shine like ice rinks, tight rings with white Nikes and light minks
Sue the ninth finks, blew the right wing off the propeller
Of the cinderfella, your shit got more illusions than Penn & Teller
Perhaps I’ll flip a Stella, well off like [?????] shorts get sawed off
That’s why they got caught off guard without their rods
You out of luck, pah

[Chorus x3]

.
.
[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Maybe, maybe it’s the money, baby, or maybe not
Maybe I fell in love with ya on the spot, never lie
I keep it G, I told you that there off the top
Maybe you never met a street nigga thuggin’ on the block
I ain’t fuckin’ with no thot shawty
Powerball, this your shot shawty
And if they hatin’ let them talk, shawty
And I been drinking too much, and it got me thinking too much
You in my head [?]

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I say boy you done did it
Love how you kiss it
Ooh you can get it
I never felt like that before
Ooh, you the realest
Yeah, I admit it
All in my feelings

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, the wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin’
A little cocky, I can deal with that
Cause you put it down and I need lots of that
Is that your phone? Where you at?
Give me rounds, I need all of that
You ain’t even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
Now is you tryna take it down or nah?
Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it’s the liquour, maybe it’s the song
Don’t know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it’s the bar, maybe it’s the car
Don’t know what it is, maybe I’m in love

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
In the club twisted, reminiscing
Boy, I can vision round two
It’s me and you and I’m winning
There’s no competition, boy, you about to

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low?
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those
Cause you you TMZ, you Sandra Rose
That’s little sis, I’m big bro, let’s go

[Intro/Chorus]
Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me freak-freak like me-me
Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me, freak like me
Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me, freak-freak like me
(La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la)
Freak like me, freak like me, you a freak like me
Freak like me
(La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la)
You a freak like me, freak like-like me
Freak like me, freak-freak like me

[Santigold]
Sitting pretty on the top watching all you wantin money
Take over, take over
Do you know where you give up, when you fear my voice on TV
They over, they over
Got money, money, money goes, turn it up and turn it down
Coming out with nothin ooh, tell me when you hit the ground
Just this once I let you go, ‘fore you walk you pass the ground
And you don’t know, oh no no you don’t know

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
What you want you’ll never stop, guess that means you made it honey
You’re famous for what? It matters more that
You look good in Photoshop, you’re still tan when it’s not sunny
Keep flyin higher, {?} as a tiger
It’s funny, funny, funny though, now we buy it by the pound
Comes another puppy ooh, give a smile and turn around
How far will you let it go, it’s a game of pleasure now
And you don’t know, oh no no you don’t know

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
If you will, there’s no need then to lay down
Why could you not stand, take a chance now, oh

[Chorus]

(Verse 1)
Moment of silence for the champions
For those who make goin hard a lifestyle
Never wait for nothin, gotta get it right now
I’m in the spotlight when they turn the lights down
Only the champs win the hardest in the twelfth round
I love the fourth quarter, I love the ninth inning
I love game seven, bring on the competition
Cause in my heart; can’t nobody do it better
Can’t slow me down, won’t stop me; never
I’m so Cassius Clay, I’m Tyson in the crown
You don’t leave with it, I’m Barry Bonds with mine
I beat the buzzer baby, my stroke is hole in one
You see the checkered flag? Finish, now here I come
And I ain’t gotta brag, I let the trophies do it
Around here we the best, now come and hold me to it
I specialize in everything that can’t be done
Ain’t no more talkin ‘bout it, moment of silence for the champions

(Hook, Unidentified male vocalist) [ ] = Ron Artest
They say we warriors, they say we did it again
[Hands high for the champions]
We are victorious, we only in it to win
[Stand up for the champions]
No surrender and no retreat, we take the battlefield over every time
[Aye, clap yo hands for the champions]
We came, we saw, we conquered everything in sight
[Moment of silence for the champions]
Ayyye yo, aye yo, aye yo
That’s the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
[They screamin]
Ayyye yo, aye yo, aye yo
We run the town here, can’t you tell when we come through
[They screamin]
The champions
[Cause we are]
The champions
[They screamin]
The champions
[Cause we are]
The champions
Can’t nobody handle us
There ain’t no competitors
No wonder why we are
We are the champions

(Verse 2)
You read the newspapers, you saw the magazines
You got the internet, but you ain’t gotta Google me
My name is up in lights, my face is well-known
You see us, Superbowl; dancin in the end-zone
You see us takin shots of vodka out the stainless cup
You see us runnin out, tellin ‘em what the? Fire it up
And in my heart; can’t nobody do it better
Can’t slow me down, won’t stop me; never
I’m Dale Earnhardt, I’m so Micheal Phelps
So many gold medals, too many title belts
I started off state, and came up from there
Now I’m the world champ, and reppin everywhere
Call me incredible, work that pic impeccable
I did it for the decimals, and now I can’t let it go
I specialize in everything that can’t be done
Ain’t no more talkin ‘bout it, moment of silence for the champions

(Hook, Unidentified male vocalist) [ ] = Ron Artest
They say we warriors, they say we did it again
[Hands high for the champions]
We are victorious, we only in it to win

No surrender and no retreat, we take the battlefield over every time

We came, we saw, we conquered everything in sight

No wonder why we are
We are the champions

* send corrections to the typist

[Verse 1]
Listen baby, sometimes I know I be playin
but set aside the bullshit, I’ma grown ass man
Whats to understand that I love to fuck
Can I hit it from the back or put ya ass in a buck?
Screamin Shawty what’s up, are we fuckin’ are what
We ain’t got nothin to discuss I’m simply tryin to bust nuts
The temperatures risin’, We reachin the bed
Ya eyes begin to roll in the back of ya head

[Verse 2]
Bangin’ Headboards, The loud noise, The sound of you screamin
Turn me on cus it sound like you singin’
Sayin my name constantly, Sayin’ daddy keep fuckin me
Get it how you want it long as you keep lovin’ me
Put ya thing down
Boom the bedroom do it right
And it jus might be a long night, Alright
Now be Quiet you don’t want them to hear us outside
let me get on bottom while you ride

[Chorus]
Bedroom Boom, (Thats whats goin down tonight)
Bedroom Boom, (Let me do ya body right)
My bed will be boomin’ for you... (boom boom)
Bedroom boom, (All between the sheets baby)
Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy)
My bed will be boomin for you

[Verse 3 (Avant)]
It feels like heaven when were off in this room together
I Can hear the music playin, then I hear ya voice sayin
"Ohh daddy now jus give it to me right there."
"Ohh baby, Take a handfull of my hair."
Cus you like it rough (rough) can’t get enough (nough)
Cus I’m the type of nigga thats gon fill you up, like a cup
And make this love thing overflow
I won’t stop until ya body’s tellin me so
Sheets gettin’ sticky from the strawberries and whipped cream
If these walls could talk they would say this is one hell of a scene
Now you movin ya body jus like a gymnist
From the bed to the dresser, All type a’ crazy shit
Case is tellin me stories, Body’s hot and so horny
Hittin it from the rear, Wanna wisper somethin in yo ear
"I’m gonna love you all night... I promise."

[Chorus 2]
Bedroom boom, (Bedroom boom!!)
Bedroom boom, (I can hear it baby!)
My bed will be boomin’ for you, (We’ll be Fuckin all night, yes..)
Bedroom boom, (Hittin yo body!)
Bedroom boom, (Like boom boom boom!)
My bed will be boomin’ for you
(My bed will be shakin’ til’ the screws come loose, while I’m off in it)

[Verse 4]
Boom goes the bedroom, Behind closed doors
And the bedroom depends on how far things go
You move slow or move fast when you off in that ass
But you hittin’ that mothafucker like everytime yo last
Spread yo legs like a bald eagle, Work that back
Move like a snake when you do dat dat
Now be quiet, You don’t want them to hear us outside
Let me get on bottom while you ride

[Verse 5]
You hotter then the eye on the stove
(Yea) Temptation got ya outta control
(Mmm Hmmm) You tremblin’ like you out in the cold
You screamin’ you can’t take it no more
Beat the pussy so bad we done fell on the flo (Can you believe it?)
Throw our clothes in the kitchen and in the garage
All this love is waitin for you like I’m El DeBarge
See my dick stay hard. (Oh) And its gon stay cocked
(Yes) If a bitch fuck wit me she gettin her cherry popped

[Chorus 3]
Bedroom boom, (This is serious business, Baby)
Bedroom boom, (What goes on in this room, So what baby..)
My bed will be boomin’ for you, (Say Boom! boom!)
Bedroom boom, Bedroom boom, (And it feels amazing!)

[Verse 1]
A yo the road I travel is full of hard times and hard rhymes
Lost souls with strong minds, Visionaries have gone blind
Politicians that love crime, Missionaries missed the warning signs
On this road I travel, I had the long nights with tears
God whispered to me have no fear
I’m perfecting the path, putting pieces of the puzzle together
You and the rats won’t struggle forever
On this road I travel, I heard the drums bang in the slums
While the hustlers be bangin they guns
And the poor, they just begging for crumbs
Some preachers still begging for funds
Outsiders catch a vibe when they come
On this road I travel, mysteries unravel
Cases get caught by the thunder of the judges gavel
From nine months to nine years
Sometimes my only peace is the pen and the poetry of my peers

[Hook]
Yo it’s like a heat wave
Beats Blaze
We write to the rhythm the street plays
We told you pray for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning
Yo it’s like a sound storm
Crowds swarm
We got them worried from the bury to California
Prayin for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning

[Verse 2]
They call me Raphi shock stopper. Lightning bolt blocker
I’m a grown up. Blown up head bubble popper. Tightrope walker
Not the typical belly flopper in a record pool
I say, "Don’t play doormat!"
Get your back up off the floor and act like it’s your crib
Flip the script and steal the show. Grand theft ad lib
I’m a hybrid wiz kid amid the greats
Shoveling through record crates and I got what it takes
Don’t wanna babble. I want to be the one who educates with class
Speak a lesson quick. Fast enough to give you whiplash
You’re still throwing out that lip trash?
Now you’re about to crash
From cell blocks to bell rocks, my clientele jocks
So ask any one of the many what they thought
There will not be those who left untuned
Some diss, some jock, some listen, some talk
But all of them felt something about the groove
That proves that I’m certified top notch
A West sider knight writer, I ain’t a baywatch

[Hook]
Yo it’s like a heat wave
Beats Blaze
We write to the rhythm the street plays
We told you pray for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning
Yo it’s like a sound storm
Crowds swarm
We got them worried from the bury to California
Prayin for the morning, but you didn’t heed the warning

[Verse 3]
I write rhymes to the lights of the city while I’m floating down the freeway
Inhaling dirt through my lungs push auto replay
Words are coming at the speed of sound
Cali quakes when Big Shame and this kid from New Breed’s in town
And the world feel the after shock for all them cats that forgot we make the planet rock
It’s lonely at the top that’s why we came with the clan
We knew from Tunnel Vision that we had the master plan
It seems to me that a responsibility’s on my back
To bring back a respect for this art
So we do it from the heart
That way, a light can shine
Plus, I rhyme to find some kind of divine vent for my rage
This cage-like white rage might seem suitable
Heinous crime for a dangerous mind isn’t do-able
So kid, got a beautiful floweth over my cup
From Mission Park to Cali
Quakin’ forever shakin’ it up

I have got a special hat
Mmm-mmm

Woke up this morning, feeling super
Where’s the butler?  Pass me the butter
My muffins are freshly baked
Wake up, then I stretch and shake

My life, well yes it’s great
Like I live on a slice of special cake (Mmm)
With a load of ingredients
If my home is my castle that’s most convenient
Because my home is a castle
And I laugh at the top of my turrets

My drawbridge is over a moatfield
With tea and I’m far above it
I just love it, this life of mine
Like everyday is a private shine
Lighting my way through the unsightly times
To the stage where I find that the mic is mine

I love it, to see the friendly faces
View as strange as my fan bases
I love them almost paternally
I have an orang-utan serving me
Is that so ecentric?
Invention just makes me open-ended
So if you’re special but no-one’s said it
Shout with me "It’s all so splendid"

It’s splendid
Yes indeed
It’s splendid
I’m really pleased
It’s splendid
Well isn’t that nice?
It’s splendid
So sing it twice
It’s splendid

Yes indeed
It’s splendid
I’m really pleased
It’s splendid
Well isn’t that nice?
It’s splendid
(ha-ha)
[man and woman sigh]

That took it out of me
Where am I again?
Oh yes, there we go (aaahhhhh)

The fresh smell of a newly mowed lawn
First cup of joy on a misty morn
When you sip from a dark brew
In a sharp suit watching cartoons
Your very own baby
Flame haired ladies
Lovely roast hen with Yorkshires and gravy
Or a ride where you scream for joy on a steam-powered flying machine
Or a scene from your new ambition played in the present tense
Or some sentiments sent from a loved one to end offence
Or eleven pence paid for a Marmoquin 
Sitting at a bar with a glass of Pimm’s
Getting what you want for your birthday
Or watching the Las Vegas Mermaids
Sitting in a deck chair listening to sea
Or listening to me
Knowing that you said what you said and you meant it because everything is ever so 

It’s splendid!
Yes indeed!
It’s splendid
I’m really pleased
It’s splendid
Well isn’t that nice?
It’s splendid
So sing it twice!
It’s splendid

Spit again is on yo set, on deck
Sound Bombing three with my dudes
Mr. Choc, Big Cyphs (rob ya all day, yeah, what)

[Verse 1]
Lord some boy gon’ get dead tonight
Licking pussy oh boy didn’t I man? 
oh boy one, test ten if he come try
Many Morroco suffer, many Morroco die
Semi-autos to stutter bucka, bucka, bbucka 
Calling popo for cover, rhyming with Cocoa Brovaz
Pure murder since the day of discover
One-of-a-kind never find another
Spit rhymes like no other
Sick line grip chrome nines with rubber
Get high in public, ride in trucks puffing
Slide in clubs scutting, whore hunting, start buzzing
‘Till sun grows something, google on something
Ya’ll lame like ruffin’ sexy something it don’t nothing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
(Fire Bun) man I deal what the fuck Rick
Mack 11 on ya now ya traffic touch with
Ya gun know check the steal on ya guns
With the world wide champion killer sound
Yeah yeah boy, who you wanna rump with? 
So you can call the police on some clap shit
You ain’t gangster I live by the street code
Been told never let beef grow old, get rid of that
Like prince crime pistols muzzle’ em up
Half of a man on the dash, trucks guzzle it up
Like I’m highway hustling hazing it up
Star and Buck ain’t the only niggaz heatin’ it up

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
It’s like murder (scared boy gangster run away)
It’s like murder (informer boy informer)

[Bridge 2] x3
No, no, no don’t take from now and then
Can’t test the sound, so boy we run you outta town 

[Verse 3]
Lord some boy gon’ get dead tonight
Grimy of the never since I been out the light 
In the eyes of the media, fuck’em yo
I’m still out in public taking the dough
Got a fiend for the right guard with hands like apes
For the strips from the plate gorilla smack ya face
Rhyme a day no rhyme but it’s nine to spray
Keep a safe full of bail money just in case

[Verse 4]
The routs we take have us on the run from Jake
The rules we break keep us on the move for cake 
Niggas can’t wait to hate, DJ’s dub my plate
These days the PJ’s ain’t safe
Weed smoke clouds my face, whores be crowd my space 
Twin fofo’s ‘round my waist, Keep a extra round to waste
Some x some haze, Smith and Wesson ga ga ga threat ya stage

[Chorus]

Savage on the beat
When you listen, you got to pay attention
And pay attention, got to listen

Let me tell you a little something about me
DCF 31st EZT
I can’t stand a old pussy ass (), especially ratting ass pussy ass ()
Transform to super nussie, rob a bitch
Building houses with them other niggas bricks
the last straw, so now it’s time to knock your ass off
Sneak attack, try my best to knock your back off
I talk shit bitch, because that’s what I do
Hiding in yards, playing Peekaboo
You know the routine, not gimmicks
I tried to change but I guess it’s just in me
Lortab and xanax bar
Lortab and xanax bar
Bitch niggas can’t stand me
everybody eats, I keep it trill with my family

I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing

Nussie gots to go (what?!)
nussie gots to go (what?!)
That boy acting bad, he gon’ ruin us for sure
I’m a gangster times ten everyday
Riding around town, bumping Morisday
In ‘89 I was slinging powder packs
scored an oz and i paid a stack for that
7grams 250-300
drought season, head first slinging dummys
gold teeth with the champaigne glass
(), call me anything but broke
bad bitches with the jerrycurl juice
In her ear she bust a new orleans hoops
go to jail and your partner make your bail
wasn’t no such thing as, ‘I’mma tell’
if you ratted, you die the same day
pull off with my pack, you die the same day

I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing

Parish prison, been there, done that
I’d rather that, than that black cadillac
I gives a fuck what you say about me
Because I’ll make you shit in ()
I’m different
aint nobody like me
aint nobody like me
DCF, ceo and the audience
Got plenty sense, but sometimes I get retarded
and ball like the man
Don’t show me shit, because I’ll call Diablo to double back and hit the lick
Call me mister Really be Doing Them Things
Really be jacking, really be () them great big ol things
I told you pay attention when you listen
and when you listen, pay attention
I hear you pimping, you paid, you straight
Yeah, I know him, he real... fake

I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don’t believe you bitch ‘till you kill something

You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing

Uh, Big Breed
Flashin’, flashin’

Flashin’, flashin’

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x
Smokin’ ounces of the good weed, we ball like dat
Hoes just love to page me, they call like dat
Drinkin’ nothin’ but the Henny nigga, y’all like dat
Don’t fuck with one of us cause see, we all like dat

[MC Breed]
Why I oughta! (Don’t do it dawg)
Fuck it, I’ma go there
Evidence of my residence is nowhere
I’ll look for the address (what) I ain’t impressed
I’ll address you like "Bring somethin with you"
And "May the Lord bless you"
For real though, skills grow outta control
Forty beat him by the big bop four they done fold
Leave the bank account (why) but the safe work cool
And outta Flint and act the fool
I put it down for the record so you can sweat me if you wanna
Smell of the aroma, marijuana, uh, dig it
With the hammer cocked knowin’ ya fuck
While to hit the block, pushin’ rocks
With niggas I don’t know and they might be cops
Aww fuck it, my kids gotta eat
Tonight, tommarow night, all next week, feel me
To wanna stop me is to kill me, I’m hoppin’
If they probably send the best feds to drill me, motherfuckers
Cause I’m clean when they see me on the streets nowadays (why)
Cause nowadays niggas are warned and chains
That nigga gone blow, I seen him at the sto’
Tellin’ them motherfuckers to get down on the flo’
You know how this shit go, before we hit the do’
{*gun clicks*} just so end up by the .44
Drama, and that’s just why your mama can’t stand me
I go to Ghetto Theater’s to get my Ghetto Grammy

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x

[Shoestring]
Motherfucker, you be lyin’ put you on a strecher
When them thugs test that ass, bitch they couldn’t catch ya
You was runnin’ for your life, prudent and prime gurdle
Even seen it on the news, you didn’t miss a hurdle
You’ve been scooped by a grouch, you got busted balls
And that mess you used to have, now it’s pussy walls
So save that killin’ shit you talkin’ for them outta states
Cause in my city and yo’ city, bitch you known to break
So who the fuck you think you foolin’ you’s a small baller
Shoestring and Ghetto E the fuckin’ shot callers
Niggas dacin’ in this shit like dope fiends
If you beef, or have some killers on your fuckin’ team
Cause if you don’t motherfucker then you ass out
You let ‘em get you for your goods and your glass house
But you rap about you bustin’ niggas in they chest
And rollin’ niggas up like onions or buddha zest
You big ballin’ like a motherfucker let you tell it
It’s a pussy in this bitch and a nigga smell it
You wanna fuck me, motherfuckin’ nigga catch these knuckles
You played out like the motherfuckin’ hang buckles
Shoestring loose in this motherfucker bring the drama
Got no love for your ass nigga, fuck your mama
So when you see me put your back up against the wall
My name is Shoestring bitch, I’m known to ball
Big ball, is what I do!

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x

[Ghetto E]
{*yawn*}
I woke up, pissed some herb, jumped in the shower
Told my niggas to come and scoop me in an hour
It’s summertime, eighty-seven degrees
In the candy coated Cutlass on gold-D’s
Hit the switches, saw some bitches in short skirts
Spillin’ Remi, fuckin’ up the Nautica shirts
But the Planet Rock Sony system was poundin’
Throwin’ gang signs, mean muggin’ niggas and clownin’
Smokin’ Killa, my nigga Breed broke out the stash
It’s a party at the beach that we ‘bout to crash
Mad bitches at the beach, I felt like I’m dreamin’
Sun-rays hit my diamonds and got ‘em gleamin’
Volleyball in the sand but we ain’t playin’
Only came to eat and drink, cause that’s how we layin’
Five o’clock beach closed, now we just lerkin’
No more Remi so we started erkin’ and jerkin’
Still early, eleven-thirty, time to hit the club
Club jumpin’, DJ bumpin’ that "I Don’t Want No Scrubs"
It’s delicious, gettin’ kisses from every ho I see
‘Til they close we poppin’ Mo’s in the V.I.P.
Head to Hunter’s, dressin’ sleppin’ to watch the QB’s ball
On the stage bad bitches doin’ the booty-call
Tellin’ bitches if you come with my clique you screwin’
(Ay, so what cha’ll doin tonight)
Breed tell these hoes what we doin’

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x

[EMD]
Yeah, what’s up man?
[Kangol]
There goes that girl they call Roxanne.  She’s all stuck up
[EMD]
Why you say that?
[Kangol]
Cause she wouldn’t give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said "Hello
I’m Kangol from UTFO."  And she said "So?"
And I said "So?!? Baby don’t you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I’m Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I’m concerned ain’t nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I’m all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn’t be upset
Cause I’m not a gambler, I don’t bet
I don’t be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo."
I thought she’d be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I’m a sinister trap
I thought it’d be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that’s what I get for thinking, ain’t that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain’t comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she’s an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I’d bang Roxanne
Chorus:
Roxanne, Roxanne, can’t you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
[EMD]
You Kango, I don’t think that you’re dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn’t need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she’ll take to my rap, cause my rap’s the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn’t like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she’d love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she’d name the baby Harry
Her mother’s name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it’s scary
So isn’t not every, her father’s a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn’t voluntary
His daughter’s name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It’s only customary to give this commentary
Some say it’s bad, some say it’s legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You’ll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That’s what you get, it happened to me
Ain’t that right Mixmaster I-C-E
Chorus
[Kangol]
You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you’re educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can’t resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she’s a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I’m the debonoir Doc
I said "I’d like to speak to you if I can
And if I’m correct your name is Roxanne."
She said "How’d you know my name?"  I said "It’s getting around.
Right now baby you’re the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief."
She said "I’ve seen you before, you look like a thief."
I said "Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that’s not my style, that crime I’m not related
As far as I’m concerned I’m too sophisticated."
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said "You call yourself a doctor?"  I said "This is true."
She said "Explain to me really what doctors must do."
I said "This is very rare because I don’t say this every day
There’s a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you’ll see me and you’ll know you’re again
There’s enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body."
She said "Ooooh, that’s very unique."
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date
[EMD]
Did you take her to the beach?
[Kangol]
That’s what we planned
But she stood me up, Roxanne, Roxanne
Chorus
[Kangol]
And here’s our gameplan
[EMD]
The beat is here, so we will reveal it
[Kangol & EMD]
And if you think it’s soft, then Roxanne feel it!
[beat boxing and scratching]

[Chorus]
"Oh you"
"I’m comin’ for ya, comin’ for ya"

[Verse One] [Sunspot Jonz]
I’m comin’ for ya
A motherfuckin’ black warrior
Don’t need no Battle Axe, Def Jux, Stone Throw ya
Don’t want a brother
I’m comin’ straight for ya
Slappin’ bitch lawyers and promoters on the foyer
Balcony, you gon’ never stop me
Cock D, straight destroyed everything
Profile on this aisle
Live baby, get down
Like Columbia, high jack a stupid bitch now
So walk man/Walkman, like the plank’s made by Sony
Or any other pirate
Drop ‘em to the sea
O-R-E-Y
Breathe cause I’m so fly
My nickname’s Boeing 
Ride till I die
Collide on ‘em right, make ‘em feel blue note bitch
La la la la
We do this every night
We a team
Cut so supreme
Fake fools go last like we Capitol’s yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse Two] [Luckyiam.PSC]
Effect is on
Lucky I’m a son of uhh
Back to kill it
Naw, I didn’t call her a bitch, time to get it
I’m comin’ for ya
Runnin’ under bridges they burnin’
Can’t stomach bullshit, can’t be concerned with
None of that
Nonsense, options, I’m crossin’ T’s
And I’s/eyes be PSC on that hot shit
They make me nauseous
Guard up, cautious
Mashin’ through a gang of these punks like a mosh pit
I need profit
Props can’t feed kids
Cops don’t want peace down where we live
We live day to day to day like day day’s on eighteens
We still keep ‘em clean like Friday
Next, next next time I’ma beat ‘em up my way
But rappers can’t chunk ‘em 
So momma just punk ‘em
On some King James, take the lane, just dunk ‘em
Put ‘em on a poster
Lucky’s comin’ for ya
Brushin’ off the parasites, hangin’ on my shoulders
Playin’ real life Punch Out with promoters
I try to show this
Get my motherfuckin’ money
Fork it over

[Chorus]

[Verse Three] [Murs]
I’m comin’ for
Runnin’ for, gunnin’ for
Whatever for, editor of metaphor
Competitors, I’m your apex predator
Comin’ for ya, got ya number, like the creditor
I said it’s war and nobody drew down
So I laid ‘em flat like the perm on Dru Down
Who now?
Who’s gonna step up?
I heard Murs got a brand new bitch
Shut up
Pelican mouth on a hummingbird ass
Mouth wrote a check that your butt can’t cash
Flash forward, you see you can’t beat the odds
Living Legends, you can’t defeat the gods
Believe in yourself, don’t deceive yourself
Make a plan, stick to it and receive the wealth
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse Four] [Scarub]
Life’s a gamble
Without Casino, street rules
Good Fellas, like Al Pacino
And these fools?
Keep laughin’
But I ain’t no comedian
I ain’t no ? though
Y’all don’t wanna see me when it’s stand up comedy
Becomes gut bustin’
Knock out punchline, to me slap or crushin’
Keep actin’ funny with me it’s gonna get hilarious
Explainin’ to your family what happened through parodies 
Like ha ha, half chokin’, part crazy, y’all silly
Dead serious with a smile like, "Naw really"
In Living Color and I’m A Get You Sucka
Major Payne like Damon Waynes 
And y’all Dumb and Dumber at your funeral
Def Comedy Jam
I be like, "Thanks for comin’ out y’all.
God Bless, good night."

"Oh you"

[Intro: Ghostface Killah (El-P)]
Yeah, nothin’ but fly beats runnin’ float
Around here and shit, about to pop off all (from outta
the robes, to the new world)
It’s about to pop off, (Ghostface and Lazer Face
And you never this shit before) Hide ya face, yo
I told y’all niggaz it’s about to pop (hide ya face)
Here we go, come on man, New York, we got y’all niggaz up top

Yo, this is Ghostface/Theodore, I’m magically suspicious
Police try to get money, and sell my pictures
To the star ledger, (tell ‘em), inquirin’ minds wanna know
How Pretty Tone get robes as soft as snow
Where the bird go? That shit flew south for the winter
Why my piece hold the face, the size of plates at dinner
Was Masquerade a true story? What happened to the Clan?
Did I really dodge death? Am I true Ironman?

[El-P]
Yo, this is Lazer Face, El Produnctive funk, plus you’ll dance this
I leg sweepin’, runnin’ man stance, with my commandment
Spit that, hardly arty, semi-retarded and grawnny
Ungodly stoppin’ me, put holes in your body heat
Bang, avoid your imminent, fuck with coat hanger
That lick off, of the set of altercation without anger
Was that the shit you running with? Equip this with a pair of scissors
Cook coke with a Brooklyn word poet, with Tony, the Iron Wizard

[Chorus: El-P (Ghostface Killah)]
You be lyin’ to the fans on your tape (hide ya face)
Cuz radio don’t play you, doesn’t mean that you great
Baby, less talk and shit in my face (hide ya face)
Muthafucka, we hold the legendary breath that we take
You ridin’ dirty when your man, had the plates (hide ya face)
Wear your seatbelt, and make sure to keep it light on the brakes
You been crafted by the United States (hide ya face)
You wind up gunnin’ out a chopper, another man and his hate
Oh break... (hide ya face)

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Oh shit, when the beat gon’ drop?
Fuck it, I’m gonna get big money, here we go nigga

[El-P]
Embarresed her, bastard bet, the colamity, rap knowledge
Or fever, amonk liquids stickin’ ya character
Plannin’ obitueries, with a cralon cepter
Last of the unforgiven, spittin’ insanity lectures
From where, from the era of the Dapper Dan tecture
I’m fully pullin’ on loosy nukie, from the BK sector
Oh was that the shit you runnin’ with? Yeah, bitch with a broken caraproder
The eyes on both, of the male room supervisor, of my last job

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, it’s Tony Starks, the Wallabee clarks, the fly minks
The first nigga to pop, them yellow bottles for drinks
Big links, only built for D. Coles, I peep hoes
You god damn right, I fuck fans, and get G. robes
And spinnach, bread like the Pillsbury dough
I got a red nose pick, with the high pro glow
My hydro flow? I got it locked, but y’all don’t know
Watch when your enterprise go public, and Starks just blow

[Chorus]

* "Silence & I" only appears on promo review versions

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yo I mastered the flow
I know death more than Lazarus know
And me defeated isn’t frequent like Nazareth snow
Hold ya urn into the air so ya ashes can blow
Put my burner in the air so the pacifist know
That I ain’t scared to start a revolution
Another fixed election another injustice I’ma execute ‘em
Land of the free, home of the bravest
Who you think the victim who you think the fuckin’ slave is
People on the grind working for minimum wages
Working nine to nine and seein’ the minimum paper
Not to mention the inadequacies of welfare
And the lack of a proper universal health care
They don’t know about the common man
They care about distracting you and hope that Israel’ll bomb Iran
I got a bomb in hand, and it’s for George Walker
Meet ya maker motherfucka meet ya lost father

[Hook: clip from Mobb Deep]
"It’s gangsta how we rock, while you watch
Attracted to our style this is how we get down....."
"Big jewelry and big guns
We get busy it get grizzly"

[Verse 2: King Syze]
This is concrete rap Q-Dimension pavin’ the way
It’s a sacred day waiting for my patience to pay
I’m a horse that grazin’ the haters sayin’ all that
I’m the evil that’s born when someone good passes away
I’m both good and foul things
The love and hate an unwanted child brings
Right left life death the stress of the trial brings
The best of the wild kings that’s us
This is smoked out rap get high angel dust
Roll with niggaz that be payin the dues
Playas that don’t give a fuck if they lose
Live they whole life drainin’ booze
Doc already told me is it rap or smoke
Is it bars of death for life or a whole in my throat
Hardheaded, livin’ my life regrettin’ shit
That next shit Syzemology the new testament
Do this for my niggaz call me the fan
Yo I do this for them haters sayin’ my songs don’t bang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
If this industry’s a movie I’m the starring actor
You’re an assistant for the intern at the back of ?gaffer?
But I’m only a rapper standing on two feet
Backstage with four whores on all fours
And that’s on all tours
How more can I spit a punchline and an ill statement
And keep your attention span on my records for entertainment
No explainin’ it, you do the math I did the math teacher
Miss Anita spread wine under the gymnasium bleachers
Fucker, don’t matter which homes speak
Cause we got pistols with barrels longer than Big Bird’s beak
Plus the creamy white powder yeh we sellin’ the milk D
My audio be to raw for children it’s filthy
I never leave the crib without a pack of now and laters
I pack now and blap later
And ain’t a player you can find rollin’ down the strip with hundred rounds in clips
Packin’ macks in the back of the Ac on some Big Pun shit
When you hear the click ya click run quick dick
Transportin’ handguns in mini-vans that’s the pistol whip
Celph Titled the gourmet chef ripple effect an
Inconspicuous spit will catch ya mens when I’m spittin at ya

[Hook]

What ya want girl, what ya need girl
Here go, come on, don’t act like that

I’m so dizzy, my head is spinning
She’s so fine that it should be a sin, hey, hey
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin’ knockin’ but you won’t let me in, whoo

I be dog-gone, hell to the yeah, you fine as a camel hair
Ain’t near a mammal anywhere Danny compared to you, boo boo
I know I’m country, but you want me to touch you don’t you
Wanna get raunchy don’t you, why don’t you call me
You built like a Barbie doll because you so dag-gone fine
This old mind of mine twist all kind of ways
I’m catching vertigo from a girl that’s so voluptuous
Plus striking, damn near venomous
And I’m liking the way you looking lady
Somebody cooking the right meat and potatoes baby
I’m feelin’ the way you fillin’ up that skirt
Stoppin’ traffic, droppin’ jaws like bad habits
When you walkin’, dag nabbit
You so purdy and I’m dirty, dirty
And it hurt me when you’re flirty
And all nerdy but you’re sultry
Giving me goose bumps like poultry
I ain’t chicken though, you stickin’ close to me
Could be a beautiful thing fo’ sho’

I’m so dizzy, my head is spinning
She’s so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin’ knockin’ but you won’t let me in

She got me crumbling, mumbling
Stepping on my tongue and stuttering
Hovering, wondering, you know I got that junky loving
Give me some rubbing, it ain’t gotta be hard
I just wanna mow the backyard
You know my thought, don’t try to dodge it
I’m not here to take anything, I just wanna make a deposit
Don’t be scared, that’s just my beard
I know I sound kinda weird but I’m fond of your rear
Don’t scream my ear, you remind me of my girlfriend
And her girlfriend, come on girl let’s have some children
In a whirlwind, you got me spinning like a 45
I feel like a tractor trailer rolling over on 85
I need eighty wives to keep up with my eighty lives
Everywhere I go I’m still the new guy with new lies
Let’s go mami, time to get busy
I’m taking five dramamines just in case I get dizzy

I’m so dizzy, my head is spinning
She’s so fine that it should be a sin, she’s so fine
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin’ knockin’ but you won’t let me in

You bangin’, sugar booger, I know I’m just one in a tonne
A young son of a gun, just wanting some of you honey
And I ain’t got much money, I know I’m fat but I’m funny
And I’m a hard worker and I never give up
I do whatever it takes just to live up to your expectations
No sex (what) well then I’ll be patient
I really hate to toot my own horn but a ooh gah
But it’s looking to me boo like you need a new guy
What you want, a Late, a ham on rye
Girl I’m just trying to get in your bloodstream
Like E Coli, you so fly, you got the pelican flyin’
Just tell me what I gotta do to get a thigh
A breast or wing or something
Up above of all the pumpkins, what am I a bumpkin
Straight out of Atlanta, Rehab or something
I just wanna be with you, lay up in the hay with you
Say hey to you, you know you could do ? together

I’m so dizzy, my head is spinning
She’s so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin’ knockin’ but you won’t let me in

I’m so dizzy, my head is spinning
She’s so fine that it should be a sin
Good Lord shorty, sure looking sporty
I keep knockin’ knockin’ but you won’t let me in

What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot
What ya want girl, I got a whole lot
What ya need girl, I got a whole lot

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

[Intro]
It’s all there!
It’s all there in those books on the shelf!
Supression breeds violence!
You see that kid? Last week he just wanted to get laid
Now he wants to kill somebody
You should have let him get laid!

[Trademarc]
I want rage splattered on the front page
I want everybody’s focus left hopeless
And their two hands grabbin every paper on the newsstand
And the press’ll be impressed with my home-shot clips
Readin letters out a journal as I sit and confess
I’m more like the rest than you realize
More like the ones you idealize
More like a martyr who just couldn’t bother barterin
or followin the hollow when I see lies
Three guys, one plan
Kill everybody you can, no discretion
Strays spray each direction hopin for a fresh connection
Opening the flesh of every classmate, love or hate
I’m obsessed with the blast rate, stressed from peer pressure
I measure my success in deaths
I guess I’m more or less a mess, the mass media
will have me lookin like a random animal in tandem with the rest

[Chorus: Esoteric]
You know they say the most silent might be the most likely
to have the most violent psyche (yes)
The most quiet type usually the wired type
The shoot ‘em up bang bang dog nighty night (die!)
Killing’s cool with me, you will need a eulogy
It’s time to take this mass murder to a new degree
A hale of bullets pierce everybody’s skin (but what?)
But killin you then killin me, that’s a win/win

{*scratched: "I’m down to start a riot in a minute"*}
{*"Buck buck buck! Cause I don’t give a motherfuck"*}

[Trademarc]
And I’m blessed with a grim grin
Killin you and dyin is a win/win
It sinks in, I think when
It must have all closed in at once within a couple months
We were armed and ready now I’m sittingcalm and steady
So deadly already it’s like I never miss
Kill with no prejudice, no known nemesis
Like I didn’t exist when everybody sat around and reminisced
I barely ever made the list
I was quietlike, not the riot-type amiss
My wrists crack from the kickback, a double fist
of knickknacks but now I sit back, think of my friends
Think of my family, think of the end
Think the message I send will blend well with the war on terror
In the weather, ten o’clock news is the ten o’clock blues
I laughed and the blackness consumes my views
And move on through the darkest hues

[Chorus]

[Outro - samples James Nichols from "Bowling For Columbine"]
Cause certain people, said
I’m a radical, I’m a wild man
I got a gun under every arm
Down every leg and every shoe
Every corner of the house
If you say anything to me I’ll shoot you! Ha ha
If people find out how they’ve been ripped off
and, and and enslaved by the powers that be
They will revolt with, anger~! Merciless anger
There’ll be blood running in the streets

* Black-Ty is the rapper and Tyrese is the singer
 
[Intro: Tyrese + Black-Ty]
Oooooh, ooh-hooo yeahhhh, ahem
Ay play that back one more time (okay here we go)
{*knock on door*} Ay who dat?
  It’s Black-Ty!
What’s goin on man?
  I gotta holla at you about somethin
Give me one second
 
[Black-Ty]
Nah, you been ignorin me for years
I wanna talk to you right now about my rap career
But I’ma take you way back to when you first start rappin
‘Member you was in the rap group Triple Went Pack
 
[Tyrese]
Mannn I don’t wanna talk now I’m in the vocal booth
Tryin to get this song done like I’m supposed to do
I need you to get up outta here
I don’t wanna talk to you about no rap career
 
[Black-Ty]
See, that’s the problem, we don’t share the same vision
I’ve been tryin to think of what to say to make yo’ ass listen
But nah, every time I bring up the subject
You comin back at me talkin R&B; shit
 
[Tyrese]
Cause I know hip-hop, is a dangerous game
I love hip-hop, but I don’t want that thing
All my concerts, got girls in the audience
I don’t want nobody tryin to take my life and shit
 
[Black-Ty]
Yeah right, you know you wanna get back on the mic
Cause every time you on stage singin you cuffin the mic
Tellin your fans to put they hands in the motherfuckin air
And wave ‘em side to side like they just don’t care
 
[Tyrese]
But the rap game to me seems shady
All them diss records will probably drive me crazy
All the ladies give me love when I go to club
I don’t wanna have to keep my eyes out for no thugs
 
[Black-Ty]
Aight, I admit it, the rap game’s a little shady
But they ain’t gon’ ever dance in the club to songs like "Sweet Lady"
I see you pop bottles with top models and then you go to the floor
You dance to e’rybody’s shit but yours
 
[Tyrese]
Mmm, nigga you startin to piss me off
Won’t you climb back in your box, Black-Ty get lost
I can’t believe you send that ‘bout my song "Sweet Lady"
Please leave me alone, you about to drive me crazy
 
[Black-Ty]
Man you trippin, it’s way cheaper to make a rap album
Ten to fifteen thou’, you payin 100 thou’ per track
And you don’t wanna rap nigga?
Put out two or three albums and go platinum nigga? Damn
 
[Tyrese]
Mmm, man I’m not listenin to you
I love R&B;, this is what I do
R&B;’s the reason that I’m drivin that Bentley
House on the hill, bank account got plenty
So nigga don’t talk to me, about R&B;
when every rap nigga out tryin to sing
 
[Black-Ty]
Yeah that’s true, but I ain’t gon’ ever do that shit
I’ma call a R&B; nigga to sing that shit
Matter of fact think about it, me and you can be on the same record
Me on the verses, and you can sing the hooks and shit
Man, I guarantee we’ll win a Grammy with that
That’s on me, we’ll shake up the industry with that
 
[Tyrese]
Probably so, but no, I don’t wanna do a song wit’chu
Cause I probably never ever get along wit’chu
Who do you think you are, talkin to me
Nigga get up outta here ‘fore I call my security
 
[Black-Ty]
Call ‘em, I don’t give a fuck, we from Watts, remember?
I walk right past the sign that said ‘Do Not Enter’
Matter of fact you a singer, why you need security?
Ain’t nobody even after you; you Hollywood dude
 
[Tyrese] Nigga hold up, I got a phone call comin through
 
[Tyrese Gibson \xc2\x96 the actor]
This is Tyrese Gibson the movie star, I make more money than both of you
While you talkin rap and R&B; dude
Everybody that, raps or sing is makin movies
 
[Tyrese + Black-Ty] Why is that?
 
[Gibson] Cause ain’t no money in the music industry; one!
[Tyrese] Uh, damn, did he hang up the phone?
 
[Black-Ty]
Yeah the nigga’s Hollywood, he’s gone
Like I was sayin, I just wanna get at you about some business homie
 
[Tyrese]
Ooooh man I don’t wanna talk to you about this shit no more
Please get out of my vocal booth and walk out the door
Who do you think you are talkin to me?
I’m a singer and all my fans love me
 
[Black-Ty]
I ain’t tryin to stop you from singin R&B;
I been in a little box for 12 years, I just wanna breathe
Let me out please, I guarantee
that everybody in this industry gon’ wanna do a song with me
 
[Tyrese]
Awwww damn, let me think about it...
Awwww damn, I’m done thinkin about it
Hell no, hell no
I don’t know if I’m ready to let you out (let you out)
These niggaz might not understand what you about (you about)
You might be cursin and callin women out they names
It might be disrespectful to my whole fanbase
 
[Black-Ty]
Nah man, I got a whole lot of respect for these hoes
I’m just fuckin with you nigga, for real it’s a joke {*chuckles*}
 
[Tyrese]
Nah man, I don’t really think this shit is real funny
Because of my fans I made a whole lot of money
I was able to travel around the world and shit!
Five-star hotels with black cards and shit!
I know I never won a Grammy, so what?
Everywhere I go my fans show me so much loooove
 
[Outro: Black-Ty]
Fuck it, pssh
Guess I ain’t gon’ ever be able to get through to you
I don’t give up that easy though
I’ma get at you tomorrow
Go ahead and finish your lil’ R&B; song punk
{*door closes*}

[Z-Ro]
Since I been out by myself, I keep that bitch Nina with me
If you my enemy, you don’t wanna be the last nigga that seen her with me
Z-Ro haters be making my attitude, rude
Fuck around and get stole on, if you fuck up my moves
Dude, finally I found myself, I had to stop
Blowing that kick em cause eventually I would of drowned myself
Already need a anger management class
See if a busta cross me, it don’t matter the situation I damage his ass
Soldier that’s what I be, so bitch
Why you trying to play me like a H-O-E
Turn me loose so I can make it to the T-O-P
It’s like I’m in a bucket full of C-R-A-B’s, but I keep climbing
And I keep on rhyming, while they be bumping they gums
Looking at my diamonds whining and blinding, no dumping they guns
Cause they can’t see me, bitch I’m invisible to the hate
Thugged off in my kitchen, cutting chemicals in my cakes

[Chorus]
Talking down on me from a safe place, now I’m in your face
What you gon do now
Barrettas and Rugas on my person, they would do ya if I burst em
What you gon do now
Mo City my block showing no pity for cops, if you trespass
You done fucked up now
No busting in the sky first one through your thigh, second ones a chest blast
I done lucked you out now

[Z-Ro]
Niggas be cool in my face, but hate behind my back
Talk down on me in front of me, but not behind my gat
I bet you won’t do that, I bet you scared of that iron
Perpetrating like you a gorilla, selling drinks in line
You ain’t never seen the Pen nigga, the penitentiary
They talk rehabilitation, but look at what it did to me
I smoke mo’ and sip mo’, than ever before
Motherfuckers be on my nerves, so I lean on that dro
Trying to keep on dropping a bomb, on the bitch-made
Don’t be looking surprised, y’all made it this way
I got a Vendetta with lifts, that be trying to sink me
Sending police after me, and trying to link me
To aggravated robbery, and strong-arm jacking
Trying to throw me off my note, so I can’t do no stacking
Johnny Cochran over lawyer got me out on bail
Looking for niggas that was plotting on receiving my mail

[Chorus - 2x]

{Master P talking}
oh yeah you see this soldier thing we take this thing serious
you gotta be real to be a soldier
you gotta keep it tru-eal
Ghetto Commission, Mystikal, and Master P
this to all the soldiers out there and soldierettes

Chorus:
I’m a soulja [soulja]

to put my name on the wall

{Mystikal}
even if I gotta shoot to kill on the battlefield

im black and N-Oed tired of selling boulders
trying to keep it real still represent my soldiers
started from the bottom finished on the top
the wars not over cause the struggle don’t stop
bullets in the chopper food in the pot
money in the bank and weed in my sock

{Commission #1}
see a coward dies a million deaths
but a soldier dies once
see don’t blame No Limit fool

and the army had said

I made a couple of boulders
now every ghetto kid can be p

{Chorus}

{Commission #2}
now  im a marked man cause this flame on my arm 
and the tank around my neck
wasn’t expected to progress
now I hold the industry hostage
see its famed Ghetto Commission 
TSO till I die
my family consist of outlaws 
and riders who ride
im a soldier living this soldiers life
flashing my ice
when if I get killed on the battlefield
then bury me with my steel and my mic
ghetto born ghetto raised
so I use my ghetto tactics
nine times outta ten 
it results to the second lines and closed caskets
in the steel tank I ride
from the Westbank to the billboard spots
loved by few hated by many 
but we still wont stop
climb from the bottom to the top
role with the platinum and gold
a commendation from the colonel
but still I  gotta  trunk of soul

{Chorus}

{Commission #3}
im a black dicabileras
Spanish for cowboy
a no limit soldier
that’s rowdier than wild boy
I keeps a 4-5 in a holster
with a rifle across my shoulder
im a ghetto vet with a killer click
that wont hesitate to smoke ya
its Ghetto Commission till I retire
im living larger than a sire
no limit symbolizes gas
and they done mixed up with some fire
peep that flame tatted on my arm
wont play when they causing harm
we irresponsible for our actions
you niggas duck and warn

{Commission #4}
I got a price on my head 
because of the gold around my neck
and the tank on my chest
resting on my arm is a flame
I lost ride on the desert plain
made famous by wanted posters
keep a pistol in my holster
cause the laws are getting closer
role as  a No Limit soldier
on our way to the bolder
with blood on my hand
from the last man to take a stand
against me and my clan
we wanted, dead or alive
believe it or not
they jealous of our billboard spot

[Verse One: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to need you
To write you and read you
To see you is to want you
to somehow confront you
But I know the dangers
of having what my heart beats so much of
I know the dangers of love

[Chorus: Phonte]
My sweet marzipan
You come as fast as you can
of love’s sweetest candy, why waste it? 
You might not taste it again

[Verse Two: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to fear you
I’ve got to be near you
You shook me, and saved me
with love that you gave me
You gave me a reason
to get up in the morning
You gave me a reason to smile

[Chorus]

{guitar and horn solo}

[Verse Three: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to love
Place nothing above you
You have me, you hold me
You bought me and sold me
But I know the dangers
of having what my heart beats so much of
I know the dangers of love

[Chorus]

[Magnolia Slim]
Pass me the weed and give me this dollar so I can snort this dope
And when you roll it right, roll it so it can go up my nostrils
Shit I get hostile, change my whole fuckin’ way
Walkin’ through the whole project with a AK
But ya can’t see me, I’m camouflaged down
When I shoot bloody bodies, they fall to the ground
You facin’ death, when you fuckin’ ‘round with my kind
Shit I can’t die, soulja sign stuck up on my mind

[Rome 1]
Man I pull up to the lot with my system crankin
Niggas posted up just smoking and drinkin
Ghetto queens wearing Apple Bottom jeans
Some of the phat asses that I ever seen
She working with a machine
Shawty got a whole team pulling up in a hummer limousine
Nichole, LaShawn, Aisha, Keisha, Refeka, Precious nice to meet cha
Your body’s stupid in LD’s classin
Its fly and its night time and you wearing sunglasses
Now let me see your eyes girl
Damn they hazel
Now lets take a ride girl
Tell your homies well be right back
Damn you just wanna up and leave like dat?
I just wanna get to know ma
I got a few things I wanna show ya ma
In my car

[Chorus]
In my car
Don’t look to hard cause my jewels might blind you girl (hmm hmm mmm)
Kick back I ‘m caressing on your thighs, that’s right
In my car
Its so many things I wanna do to you (hmm hmm mmm)
Stop fronting you kno you want me too
Ya know ya do
In my car

[Rome 2]
We can hug, we can kiss, we can touch, or crush
Forget about the club
I hope you not in a rush
You make a nigga wanna sing R & B again
Telling me how you was an IMx fan
Your body language is hypnotizing
Jeans so tight, how you get those thighs in?
Ankle bracelet and you got your tongue pierced
You got a sexy voice
Damn you so fierce
Your heads stroking my leather interior
On the real, I’d love to be into ya
I mean literally
Cause visually
You killin dem Be
And I know you feeling me
Work a blind man fingers to brail
Whatever goes down between us I wont tell
It’ll be our little secret
On the low we can get on some freak shit
In my car

[Chorus]
In my car
Don’t look to hard cause my jewels might blind you girl (hmm hmm mmm)
Kick back I’m caressing on your thighs
In my car
Its so many things I wanna do to you (hmm hmm mmm)
Stop fronting you kno you want me too
Ya know ya do
In my car

Isn’t it strange how princesses and kings
Can clown their capers in sawdust rings, just like
Poor people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Each must make his life as flowing ink
Tumbling back on a stepping stone, just like
Poor people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow

And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Look where the rain is fallen from the sky
I know the sun will be only missing for awhile
And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow

And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow
Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow
Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow
Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow

("Soul, soul-soul, soul-soul")
Yeah, it’s E-V ("How, much can you get")
Evidence, CookBook ("for your soul...")
Uno Mas {that’s whassup} let’s go!
("When you rock and roll")

[CookBook]
Honies know that money is the thing that they want
And brothers that money is the thing that they want
And both’ll hit the block and try to hustle it up
In the club sellin they soul ("when you rock and roll")
Brothers’ll fight for the ("money, money")
That dough’ll make the closest friendships start to feel funny
Your homey that you run with starts to hide certain agendas
Suddenly the great pretender ("when you rock and roll")
Yeah, don’t even bring it to the world of rap music
When we’re broke it’s buddy buddy, money comes you start to lose it
Your group starts with a dream to hit the scene and change things
Behind the scene they fightin ‘bout the same things ("when you rock and roll")
You can’t survive without that ("money, money")
Record companies give little but want everything from me
I signed it like a dummy, now I lost my control
Gave away my soul, just so I could rock and roll

("How, much can you get for your soul...")
("When-when you rock and roll")

[Evidence]
Hit the road, pack my bags, say goodbye
You know heroes get remembered, but legends never die
So I never say never, and never ask why
they pay no tolls, I guess that comes ("when you rock and roll")
Right, doin shows now there’s ("money, money")
Last year you was dumbin out, broke and bummy (crazy)
They used to want advice, now they tryin to son me
It’s funny how the tides change, y’know? ("When you rock and roll")
Cash in pocket, big bank, money fold
Accounts drained, but keep a green gangster’s roll
They keep they thanks and they praise on hold
Takes for granted no matter the debt never owed ("when you rock and roll")
Small change or big ("money, money") cha-ching!
I’m broke they don’t call, I got loot they love me
I know both sides of the fence; some days I feel like Mike
Other days Evidence is rock and roll

("How, much can can you get for your soul...")
("When-when you rock and roll")

[Uno]
Yeah, every day
Another day, another rhyme, flippin pennies to a dime
Over ten plus years been tryin to earn my shine
Make moves, stay ahead of the game and stack dough
And keep your business on point yeah ("when you rock and roll")
Everybody want that ("money, money")
Survival of the fittest and I’m tryin to stay hungry
Keep the work ethic up, nothing’s given, nothing free
If you got a lot to lose, then don’t be an emcee
This industry will pimp you out like they own the block
If your stock don’t rise then you might get locked
Doin time cause you signed, your career’s on hold
Live and learn or get burned ("when you rock and roll")
Whack emcees makin ("money, money")
You can find me in the lab, doin work, livin grimy
Nothin shiny on my neck but I got mic control
And that’s the only thing you need when you
("When you rock and roll") {*echoes*

Big city lights, little indignity
Hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don’t get some liquor I’ll hurt you
I’ll knock ya dick in the dirt bickerin worse than that bitch in that Snicker commercial
A mixture of Stifler and Urkel
Hangin from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building cause we’re tearing it down
Security get out the frickin way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it’s loud
I swear only thing I hear is the sound

A pasado el tiempo y an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes y nuevas modas
Pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena
Alegrias pero tambien tristezas
Amor pero tambien odio y este que te habla ha caminado por sombras
De valle de muerte conociendo las dos caras de la vida
Y recopelando episodios por episodio para traernos este dia
Y sembrarlos en tu consiencia
A pasado el tiempo y an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes y nuevas modas
Ayer estuve muerto y hoy vivo

[Chorus 2x]
Miden mi lenguayo aquel que habia muerto  de la tumba salio
Y ahora contra ataca con lo que aprendio
La voz de la experiencia con potencia regreso (LISTEN)

Dia a dia canto mi presar y represento
Dia a dia tengo a todo el mundo mas adentro
Dia a dia tratan de quedarse con mi asiento
Pero dia a dia se que sigo siendo el mas violento
Porque los violentos somos los que arrebatamos
El reino de los cielos donde nunca nos tiramos
Los que creamos musica madura y expresamos
No es necesario pare que aprendamos y asi que estamos(LISTEN UP KID!)
Sabes que le que traigo en accion mirando bien atento cual es tu reaccion,COMO SUENA!
No es solo por la satisfaccion si no por la batalla contra la distraccion
Ra -pap-pap-pa, quita quita la risita -sita que segun la mensaje que te ajita-jita
Asi ke dime dime antes que opines-pines canta algo que no solamente rime-rime AH!
Raperito que ya acabas de nacer AH!
Que es lo que pasa que no te puedo entender AH!
Que por el lado a quien queres aconsejar AH!
Y por el lado me queres asesinar
Ni\xc3\xb1o funny canta solamente por la fama y por el money
Aprendete mi lirica mas tirable como el Broni
Alimenticio como el cereal del tigre Tony
Y agradable como el honey
Abre los ojos y averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo
Todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran
Regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan, OK!!

[Chorus 2x]

Yo lyrical traqui trac, no traten de enga\xc3\xb1ar al mundo
Y diciendo mil palabras por segundo
Porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer
Algo especial pero terminan igual
Repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones
Se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones
Buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo
El fracaso esta automatico, maniatico rebelde y mas clemente de inocentes
Si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente
Porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica
Pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica
Ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto
Pues regresa con el muy largo YO!
Y uno arrancando la semilla que no crese
Y poniendo en su lugar la que no carece

Frittirta el rapero llego el trero te di un HIP-HOP PAPA EL ESH SHU PAPA
El que returtalo junto furtalo demonstrandome como el aguila que yo vuelo
Contaminando con el virus de mi bula muchas filosofias pero si con la palabra
Creando como trueno que extremese
Graduados de la academia de propisio 3-13
Solo dice ser poem maestro de ceremonia y todos siendo
El nuevo de PC check the flei VA! SHO!
La de Merci si le pone action, dale paso al rey de reyes
Cuando llega tu section!
Repartiendo las buenas nuevas de Salvation
A lo unico que le queda de la generation!

Yo tengo un enemigo que me quiere aplastar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Pero cada vez que puedo voy a intentar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Agresivo vengo yo con el sonido destal CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Con el permiso del papa ya no me puede imparar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA JEE!!!
Tengo para la presion, brega con la situacion habla con el corazon
Lucha por la bendicion,vela por mi condicion porque la drogadiccion
No respeta posicion tanto como tu educacion
Habran paso al novato,asme caso tu forma de expresarte para el mundo es un atraso
Tu musica nos habla de aprender a dar plomasos
Mi musica te ense\xc3\xb1a a madurar y a dar pasos

[Chorus 2x]

I thought I had competition but they really wasn’t.
Was it an ill u sion,
the way my bug shit seemed to bruise men?
Yo, I kill ‘em with my weak raps.
You heard Casual’s new shit?  
Man, you need to peep that.
Super EP, 
we treat the trooper to.  
There be no nigga alive I can’t beat,
but Snupe find me, 
and who’ll try me,
I’ll stomp ya.
T-more said, "Casual’s a monster."
I use my mutant powers on niggas shootin’ sour rhymes.
Hiero it’s our time,
so start to panic, cause doper there is.
Niggas perish tryin’ to compare their’s to this weak shit,
but it really ain’t happenin’.  I start slappin’ men, 
tell ‘em I’m the best and they react with friends.

[CHORUS:]
"This is how we rip shit. (repeat)"

Incorrect, when you wreck rhymes,
then respect you collect all the time.
I’m your mentor sent for your entertainment.
Kid, you’ll get your brain kicked,
stop tryin’ to do that strange shit.
I’m 
rockin mics like cocaine dime
when you jock you slow-brain,
I muster strength to bust ya with,
bust your riff, that’s a no-no.
Yo peep my promo, 
see how the flow go.
Surprise, 
I chastise and devise
a flow you despise,
I’m the assaulter 
who’ll alter your brain
when I clipped your sensory nerves
we fence to be heard.
Bubbling buffoons get bombarded,
but they don’t come hard with 
beats, besides that blundering bulllshit.
I pull kids back, I’m snatchin’ 
progress, catchin’ calamity, 
the famine G’s, the ones you not matchin’.
And that’s on the real, I repeal steel 
for any contendant 
I send it,
because I intended to wreck shit, 
collect clits
and disrespect kids.  
Then I’m headed for the exit.

[CHORUS:]
"This is how we rip shit.  (several times)"

From my standpoint,
I can point and pick you out,
kick you out, 
you slick, 
you doubt my skills,
where he stood he lies still, 
decayin’.  
These guys ain’t playin’
when we tries to slay men.
Leave or recieve the cleaver
that’ll relieve you of your life.
Battle me and that’ll be your downfall.
I surround all MC pests with the best 
skills.  
And still you do not be fresh.  
We testmicrophones with prolificness,
and if it’s a doozy, 
well 
I shouldn’t be choosy.
Just, ripping at will, 
I’m stripping the skill
off the run of the mill MC.
My whole goal 
is to control your brain.
I take the flimsy, 
and make them practice
so they come back with some harder shit,
try to follow the flow 
and see how hard it gets.

[CHORUS:]
Yo, this is how we rip shit (etc., etc.)

[Del]
You wan lock horns, just cause you got scorned
wanna get your plot on? D got forms of
warm receptions, important perceptions
so foreign projections in the projects, keep me
protected, cause secret objections we greet with
aggression, we teach em’ a lesson we breach the
deception, we eat ya’ for breakfast complete the
suggestion, defeating oppression the weak will retreat
with a weapon, if the walls will cease
then I’m all for peace, that’s my core belief
so why would I wanna war and beef, I don’t need more to eat
so I don’t horde the meat, the lure of the streets
is sure to keep, weak motherfuckers trying ta beat
motherfuckers I, seek and disrupt the frame of mind
that’s corrupted, skim haters of they grim nature
strugglin’ to get paper while they spit vapor.....

caskets, cremated to ashes
in this disastrous, world war of the masses
remain passive or aim and blast it
the past is, gone it’s the war of the masses

[Virt]
as we checking out of the second millenium
hear the reckoning beckoning
prefects are involved in religious lecturing
infecting in the peoples mind, evil festering
questioning they lessons and they ride on you like
an equestrian, psychotic off anti-biotics
and chemical bi-products the medicals try on us
I promise that every word is a comet
a bom for the congress, who claim to see beyond Nostradamus
you can rely on bibles if you need a guide to
provide you with vital knowledge thats born inside you
my haiku typhoon remind you
false idols blind you, crucify and bind you
why do the mass of us not see cash we lust
half of us need dough but people slash they cut
then pass the crust, most leave little for those after us
from ass and nut to ash and dust

[Hook]

V: The mercenaries we sent to retrieve the verse of aries
cursed to carry dead weight on our backs like hearsts that bury
D:Jerks immersed in the worst affairs we could describe
the impact of lies on earth is scary
business to witness, but Del and Virtch are very
revolutionary
V: Immune to any torture tactics
practice to beat the system lilke victims of an abusive family
D:Then who can we trust?
V: few if any
confusion led me to abuse the henny
but then the music let me see that there was
better ways to use my pennies
D:using various options, choosing every concoction
cause losings an illusion I foster
like who is your partner, he doing the cha-cha
I see through it cause I do what I got ta’
V:the fluid we author, for your mind shine
lucid to oculars, and magnify the truth like binoculars

Cig: The following is a true story...a story about love and heartbreak. You
put your neck out for somebody and no matter what it seems like in this life
you get fucked in the end. And no matter how hard you try, no matter how hard
you push yourself, it’s never good enough. And after all the sacrifices gone
within the blink of an eye man, I thought it was something special, now you
made the worst mistake of your life, bitch

[Cig]
It may come as a surprise cause people don’t realize
What actually takes place in peoples lives
My father collapsed right in front of my eyes
Held him in my arms, prayin’ to God he hears my cries
He’s in the hospital now while she’s tellin’ me lies
Like "I need a break Chris" and I’m askin’ her "Why?"
You think you know a person till you realize their disguise
I’m told my daddy’s comin’ home, this was our goodbyes
Who knew this bitch would leave me when I needed her most
And who knew when it was rough this bitch would turn into a ghost
See, scars run deep, and no, they won’t mend
And no matter how hard I try I get fucked over again
You need time to yourself? Well here’s some to spend
But I found out you’re in a club while I’m cryin’ here again
No dad, no guidance, so tell me this is how it ends
And this fuckin’ bitch told me we’ll still be friends!? Yeah right!

[Chorus]
Words don’t explain what it means to hold you in my arms again
Words, words cannot say I love to be with you in every way

[Cig]
The words, and I quote, "Ill always be there for you"
Let’s be true, the only person you’re there for is you
And no one should have to go through what I went through
You’re selfish, you even believe your own lies is true
And who was there when your parents kicked you out? Me
And who was there when you cursed your best friends out? Me
And who was there to buy you presents just to make you happy? Me
And after all of this, this is how you fuckin’ thank me?
Your sorry’s belated, I hope you fuckin’ die!
So you could feel the pain that I carry on inside
I wouldn’t talk to no one and all I did was cry
Blamin’ myself, askin God "Why, fuckin’ why!?"
Why I get out of bed? Why do I even try?
Nobody understands me, this life’s one fuckin’ lie
Lie in your own blood, you drove me to this
Say goodbye to the world, I’ll see you in hell bitch!

[Chorus]


[Jamal]
You know who the fuck I am nigga?
Yo yo yo yo all the way motherfuckin live
from Newark, New Jersey nigga, like that y’all
Mally G represent like that y’all
Def Squad represent like that y’all
And we got the Funk, Funk Doctor Spock

[Redman] Funk Doctor Spock, up in your spots
[Jamal]  Reggie Noble
[Redman] Funk Doctor Spock, with Jamal get wreck

Verse One: Jamal, Redman

Aiyyo, let me light the sky with the funk, and I
leave motherfuckers shook like dice, with the ice
grill, uhh I gets down like that
All these MC’s get dropped to the mat
Me, I fade em all it don’t matter what they status is
Who they run wit I show em all who the baddest is
I’m just a nigga representin the block
Comin live and direct when I rock I let the tune knock
uhh, through your motherfuckin speaker, now watch me freak a
flow with no limits fuck the mimics and the gimmicks
A lot of niggaz wanna test my steez
I don’t trip I maintain then complain on CD’s

Aiyyo, check out that new flava in your ear that amaze ya
I make circuit breakers get hot as Asia, or cool as glaciers
I counteract like macks and blow tracks out the wack
and turn MC’s into little bitty artifacts
My ghetto tactics might backflip a medic
And if I let it, my ‘matic, catch diabetics
Now who’s fuckin with the, R-E-D, in 3-D
For G-P, I beat the piss out of you real easy
Yo fuck this that and a third that’s my word
while your vision blurred you swerved and crashed while I wrecked your nerve
The baddest motherfucker since communication
I make the hardest MC, bumba like Jamaicans

Verse Two: Jamal, Redman

For all of y’all I drops the off the wall style
Absolute wild child demolish any juvenile
Philly representin peep the way that I be rippin
on the M-I-C spittin rhyme shit then I’m dippin
on a one-two breaker, funk fade the off
with the bump rump shaker, niggaz get tossed
Def Squad represents like this for the nine-five era
Insane creations are terror

Dynamite disco Denny devestating Dynamic Duo
You know, I be breakin five-oh, down to two-oh
Test my skills if you will if you real
Benadryl couldn’t cease my mental ill disturbed skill
Feel this wrath of the psychopath Shaft
I make crack addicts wanna take drags off my funky ass
Now I’m itchin, for a pitchin, who’s the batter?
Then I put you in bodybags like two six in ‘Vada
Some say I’m sharper than the knives of Baroqua
I mark the wall like M.J. but two shades darker
Funk Doctor Spock got your block on lock
I call myself the Sooperman from all the cock I pop
Check the synopse, hah, I get wickeder and wickedest
Smoke so much that the dreads started givin benefits
(Fuck the bullshit, get the cash, no hesitation)
And it’s the two niggaz droppin insane creations
Like that y’all
It’s like that y’all (like that y’all)
The bom-ba-zi got me high (like that y’all) --> 4X

[Jamal]
To my peeps in Queens (to my peeps in Queens)
It goes like that y’all (and ya don’t stop)
To all my peeps in the Ill-Ville Town (in the Ill-Ville town)
It goes like that y’all (and ya don’t stop, hoo-ahh!)
To all my niggaz in Jersey (in Jersey)

[Chorus] 
Somebody say yeah (yeah)
Somebody’s gonna die tonight, gonna die tonight 
Say yeah (yeah)
Somebody’s gonna die tonight, gonna die tonight

[Wish Bone]
If it’s like that, fuck that give ‘em what they want
Let ‘em feel that, pap pap, throw him in the trunk 
Bye bye and you can die, and so can I 
If you wanna live just walk on by 
Some don’t make it 
Bone Thugs, nigga what better show some love
Originators of that shit, you can’t fuck with 
I got my dollars, you got your dollars we can ride 
And it ain’t about money, we can all get high 
Shut ‘em down, make em feel it come around my way 
Shut ‘em down, you don’t really wanna come and play 
The thug shit I spit, I live 
I’m a real thug nigga, put it on my kids 

Chrous

[Unforgiven] 
We tear the club up all night
Spit that raw shit to make the rowdy thugs fight 
Wreck cars like rock stars 
Recognize the backstreet creeper 
Ready for war my partner Wish got the street sweeper
Shut it down, hit the ground run for cover 
Unforgiven smash hip hop clutch burn rubber 
California spot us on the low up in the Hyatt 
No phone calls just thick broads no ??? for satisfaction 
Hit the block for action 
High paced, no escape, stomp out with duct tape
Heavyweight drink yak straight to my chest break
Marinate leave it to the golden state, dumpin’ 

Chorus

[Unforgiven] 
Tryin’ to keep my composure 
Off the Henn’ and the Doja 
A step closer I’m goin’ over 
But I can’t fold the street tactics when I roll
Equipped to explode if you don’t know then Mo’ 
Floss got the Yak, Wish in the cut 
I only roll with villians that’s down to give it up
Accumulatin paper, but twenties raw shit and major
A lot of bustas talk the talk, but ain’t got the heart to start it 
Leave bodies spread apart in- 
The city where I come from 
Leavin broads tongue struck 
Messin with my money, get wrapped like a mummy 
Make ya nights sunny too much heat 
Bless the streets 

Chorus til fade

[Chorus x2]
It’s the Cyde that you feel still
When you’re sexing
Getting hyper, trying to chill
Clean you in thrills, collect mils
Leaving suckas at a standstill
Instead of going out we’re going uphill

[Imani]
Yo, we come tri-annual, haters check your manuals
Pharcyde beats are labelled as \xc2\x91highly flammable’
You’re running loose like a wild animal
Lawless, thinking you’re flawless
But they bought this from Hawthorne to Hollis
You’re too faded, you can’t do what we created
That shit is way outdated, they can’t contain or explain
The way we come with a real flow, we still glow titanium
Hitting you hard in your cranium
You look like you need some wheat grass
Some calcium or some Java juice
What’s good for the duck duck goose is good for the gander
Take a gander, fuck the red tape and the propaganda
The real shit is rare like a panda
We’re trying to expand on the previous
Trying to get the shit together like staples or seams
Cause niggas got dreams

[Chorus x2]

[Bootie Brown]
When I hear a tight beat I get anxious, ready
Like fifty niggas out the County at a Luke party
With 151 Bacardi and a stick of the stickiest
Meticulous when it’s got to represent us
I can’t trust in no kay, come with it or forget it
We move on to improve on and keep warm
While suckers only want to get a slap of reality
And some change, they call us strange
But worldwide we range coming to a city near you
Pharcyde here you entrancing, memorizing
Stem realising, instant malignment evil
But we’re cerebral, I know it’s torture to await
The reemergence of the Cyde
Banging in your club, tilt and your ride
Trying to bubble like peroxide
And heal the wound of the hip-hop neglected
And keep working to perfect it

[Chorus x2]

[Slimkid3]
You’re too near me to hear me, cross-eyed to see clearly
Side winding like a snake and yet you try to steer me
Veer me into oncoming traffic, hold up, dearie
You’re looking kind of leery, I’m trying to stay cheery
While you’re tired and weary, unable to stay stable
Unable to keep afloat, unable to rock a note
So you bring a good friend down by the throat
And most of y’all bite on anything like a goat
And when you’re hot you’re hot, when you’re not you turn cold
Lack of understanding what that provokes
Not loyal to the movement of the militant folks
But you’re good at blowing smoke up my ass like I love it
Glad to rise above it, I don’t need this shit
Too many jackasses to deal with
Like pleasure isle, we lace the mic with style and finesse

[Chorus x2]

Promise me, that you will always be my queen
I need to know that Yeeaah
Promise me, that if I couldn’t buy you things
Like your sugar jewels - you won’t care
Promise me, that you will never leave me alone
If my records ain’t hot next year
Promise me, I’ve Done been with some Chicks
Before But It Wasn’t Sincere
Shorty please promise me
If you true boo, show it
Say you going, no where
‘Cause Some Chicks Be phony
So I’m asking..

I’ve been with Plenty girls (Uh huh)
Baby actin’ thirsty (Uh huh)
Seen me on the stage, the jewels, the feet?
They don’t really care about me
And then I met you girl, Just Like I Dreamed Youd Be
Girl, you are my lover, my homie
Girl, I mean honestly; can you promise me

(Promise me)
That you won’t even take it there
Hit up the courts; want half my shares (you know)
You won’t listen to your girlfriends hating
You’ll listen to me girl first please
You’ll Hold Down My Back, Girl Handle That
And if you need a stack, I’ll give you that
Once I know you got love for me
You gon’ get some things that these chicks won’t see (no)

If you true boo, show it
Say you going, no where
‘Cause Some Chicks Be phony (Uh)
So I’m asking..

I’ve been with Plenty girls (Uh huh)
Baby actin’ thirsty (Uh huh)
Seen me on the stage, the jewels, the feet
They don’t really care about me
And then I met you girl, Just Like I Dreamed Youd Be
Girl, you are my lover, my homie
Girl, I Mean honestly; can you promise me

A man can’t fall in love out here anymore(no)
Cause some girls ain’t seen to what they seem to be (uh huh)
Cause they’ll do anything for money
But they ain’t gettin’ nothing from me
But you seem real to me
Can you promise me?

[x2]
I’ve been with Plenty girls (Uh huh)
Baby actin’ thirsty (Uh huh)
Seen me on the stage, the jewels, the feet
They don’t really care about me
And then I met you girl, Just Like I Dreamed Youd Be
Girl, you are my lover, my homie
Girl, I Mean honestly; can you promise me

Chorus: Phiness

We came here to party, join together everybody
Let’s celebrate (it’s a party goin on)
It’s a holiday (it’s a party goin on)
We came here to party, throw your hands up everybody
Let’s celebrate (it’s a party goin on)
It’s a holiday (it’s a party goin on)

[Vinnie]
Once again, it’s on, it’s been awhile since you heard the style
Yes it took a little time but now we worth your while
To all of you from my crew who been waitin so long, this
track caps off at that official Naughty bomb shit
The Ill-town party rhyme sayer
Depletin MC’s like the ozone layer
May acquire my desires and like vintage wine
we shall sell no rhyme, before it’s time
I’m, the Nineteen Naughty Nine MC
Microphone controller, master of ceremonies
So remember why you hate me
I’m Naughty By Nature you’re Severed By Association
Which meanin that you FAKE ASS NIGGAZ who connected to them
SNAKE ASS NIGGAZ, don’t come up in my FACE, ASS NIGGAZ
You try to keep on rhymin like you didn’t know
Naughty By Nature came to save ya from them BULLSHIT shows

Chorus

[Treach]
The Feds pick up the balance, watchin everything that we touch
But yeah I see the D stuck in the V-S-E-and-G truck
They watchin us, plan on knockin us, threw binoculars
My nigga I connect the bottom LOCK to the top of us
You take the topic, ain’t no profit
But give me a picture, and a compass, and I’ll do a Nostradamus
Find that ass on a quick spot, catch you slippin
like ice and silk solks, the cover of your album
be the back of milkbox
See I’m an iffer hit a shitter like an old timer
Momma, I dig a vagina like a gold miner
I’ma, rebel rhymer time trauma minus your momma
equal a lot less drama, let me talk to you mami
Maybe you could come to Dirty Jerz, New Jeru, witcha crew
You bring that ass, I’ll bring the brew
And hit some Thug Passion, and roast some D
From incense to hash’n, niggaz HOT, talkin bout crashin

Chorus

[Phiness]
Do we (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Do we
Do we, dumdum-dum-dum-dum-dum

[Vinnie]
So yo the moral of the story in this game called rap
Either we all gon’ clap, or somebody gon’ get clapped
And I’m not down with that, sure as my name’s Vin Rock
In ‘99 I will officially re-open up the block
And dedicate my life to preservation of hip-hop
I’m tired of seein the people of my culture gettin shot
And now I must step up because I know that’s all we got
I must do it, pursue it, before all the maggots make it rot
Hip-Hop, it ain’t gon’ die, it’s gon’ diversify
And as long as I’m alive, I’m gon’ promote the I
And no matter how many people try to use or difuse it
It ain’t nuttin like hip-hop music!!

Chorus 2X

[Phiness]
Do we .. doo-wee
Do we .. doo-wee-yeah..
Do we, dumdum-dum-dum-dum-dum

I squeeze and then pass it off to Dreez

If you can hear the spitz, beleive me it’s poppin’ mayne
Hair pin trigger on a chopper mayne
Just shine my rangs and fat chains
Threw on my shades like Johnny Fontane

Shit, I’m still standin’, it’s real as rappin’
My ice cold fits with skills to match it
It’s spitz like this gon’ call it quits
Blow zips, split that, then swallow this
I’m high and tech, space age no games
Mile a minute, stay paid always
Box of bleezey’s, lot’s of weed
The more Hen, but then again cop a please like

[Andre Nickatina]
Man God gimme G’s on the double, all through the wire
The bullets start to sing like a quire
The syle rotates like tires on the count of three
Blue suade, Wu-Tang Wallabees
I’m so fresh to death, you best grab your tech
It’s like Fred G. Seffer when he grab his chest
For live to bit, cause I’m known to spit
Man something said I fold and crack your whip

[Equipto]
So stack your chips immaculate
Not long ‘till I master this
Study the game, is money the same
Headed to the point, where nothing’s the same
Count your pesos, spread out all on the table
Every single pimp in the Bay know
You take it serious to break a bitch
Go hard if she lace your bitch, like this

[Andre Nickatina]
Bigger, stronger, faster, better
But lighter, than a, pillow feather
Spit’z that a stop a bull six shots
That connect all dots and a rock your knot
Parade my game through the town, have another round
Look at how the God get down
Kamikaze shots at your fortune, here’s another portion
Them hot little thangs be scorchin’
Spit a little, spit a lot or not
In the rain them thangs that go pop
Bring me back uo in the drop, roll up the pot
Sly like the fox, spin like a top
Dip up the block, and I love to shop
If you aint’t gunnin’ for me freak then bitch why not?

[Equipto]
Not no Cris’ gon’ get me tipsy
Di it like Cruise when "Business Risky"
Stayin’ all high and I fly like frisbee’s
But you can try chirpin’, my circuit’s busy
My purpose to show that I’m worth a milly
But don’t go bad like Whitney
I like Whiskey, all in your liver and kidney’s
On the hunt to bump me a Britney
I put her down right by Disney
Layin’ demand I’m like "What is it"

Special dedication going out to Frank Ski and Lorrenzo Ice-T
And if you’re with me, if you’re with me
I need some help from the music, from the maestro, check it out
Somebody make some noise in this joint man

This is to listen to, so ask not a question
Not to be taken as a simple suggestion
But a warning, to whom it may concern
If knowledge is the key, then I think it’s time you learn
For there is not the problem
So leaders are acknowledged, I don’t follow them
I turn into another degree
And find the D-O to the C and growing like a tree and
Causing much destruction cause I’m crushing
Complimented much, yeah, but never blushing
Hard like a criminal, and I’m subliminal
In my own right I’m dope cause it’s original
Funky, unmistakibly so
When the vocals are done, then you know
It’s all a matter of setting a date
For America’s most complete artist, but wait
Make sure that you keep the facts in mind
Don’t mess with The Great, cause the D.O.C. is like a nine
With a voice, telling you the bullet’s direction
I’m talking murder, but that’s another section
I need to explain by keeping my composure
There’s no jerking a sucker when he knows your
Nothing but a villian, and you’ll kill him
So he’s in fear, but there ain’t no need in spilling
Your guts to a nut, no, I am not your equal
Meaning your equivalent, I’m all like heaven sent
I got it together so clever no one could sever
Remember this forever

\tNo one can do it better (Repeat 3x)

Knowledge is the key, and hard work is the fee
For me to be The Great at the start and remain to be
A threat, til the opposition is warned
As long as a song, cause I was born
With instincts to kill, a grave mentality
Over the edge and you say you want to battle me?
At your own risk, approach and be hosted
And in the end you may win or be roasted
But seeing that it’s part of a game, you think if you hang
Close to The One and you’ll claim, but that’s lame
And I’m "Damn, another loser"
Without an apology, so next time I’m a use a
Little more force to get the message across
It’s the D.O.C. on the boss
Creating, demonstrate some realate to easy listening
But here’s a christening of what you’ve been missing
An exhibition, a hip-hop introduction
Smooth lyrical gab and I do the conducting
Drop it on a rhytm, suckers face it
But new to the masses, it’s like I’m starting classes
Better bet I understand the direction
That I’m going, in fact when I’m flowing
The news is a constant change from one minute to the next
I’m different cause I always show flex
And it’s essential, that’s why I got it together
To the letter and

\tNo one can do it better (Repeat 3x)

I need to make it understood, the D.O.C. is not a hood
Not at all, even though I carry a weapon when I’m stepping
I’m not a murderer, not in the sense that you’re a customer
I buy in the system with suckers smoothly bust them
Opposition is taken and that’s a quote from the D.O.C.
And the Doctor cause this ain’t no joke
So if you smile, here’s the outcome:
Your teeth are gone, your mouth is numb
Don’t get involved, unless you’re willing
To risk murder by mic when they’re illing
You gotta be weary, watch for caution, yo be warned
By Dre and out the project born
Capable in any and every
Cause yo I get heavy, when introduced to a medly
Such is the case before the bass started womping
I had to hook it up with the boys from Compton
Searched and found the sound and accepted
The job of making L.A. well respected
Of course with the help of the gang that’s Ruthless
Peace to the homies as I do what I mean and
MC Ren is in the house, Ice Cube is definitely in the house
DJ Yella teach Yella cold with the hoes
And Eazy E is stupid chilling cause he knows, yo
No matter who’s badder I’ll be the dopest forever
By kicking lyrics so clever that

\tNo one can do it better (Repeat 5x)

Time is dedicated to say peace to the homeboys
My homie Laylaw, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Eazy E
DJ Yella, Fresh K, MC Smooth, my homie T-Low
And of course without a doubt, the one and only
My DJ Dr. D-R-E most definitely in the house
Peace to those homies and I’m outta here

There is no way to write it... there is no way to fight it
And I kick and scream but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to hide it
Like fire in Freetown you begin to light it...

[Chorus]
Aha aha aha
Sidii hogasha roobka
Ah ah aha you shine down upon me
Aha aha aha Sidii hogasha roobka aha aha aha you shine down upon me

By some higher order you keep getting bolder...
By god or by country you kill like a soldier...
By some riddle you sung little but scream mighty stronger
Like fire in free town you old magic spoiler...

[Chorus]

You place pins in my ribs and ask me to lie down
My pain is your pleasure but pleasure is all mine
You lend me your false ear and I lend you my false lines
Like fire in free town I’m fueled by your gold mine

[Chorus]

There’s no way to right (or write) it, there’s no way to fight it
But I kick and scream and but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to fight it
Like fire in Freetown you begin to light it

(Fire, fire)
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
(Fire, fire)
She always come find me she know where I roam
(Fire, fire)
She know where to touch me to turn me to stone
(Fire, fire)
She come like a storm and she rain on my lawn
(Fire, fire)
She know where to touch me to turn me to stone
(Fire, fire)
She always come find me she know where I roam
(Fire, fire)
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home

Yo, yo you can let the magnum bust or puff bags of dust
If you mad at us, watch that ass get crushed
Now ya screamin’ why did the blood have to rush
It’s a bunch of thugs after us, slugs blastin’ us
Y’all rollers done mashed her up
The nigga with the live weapons
Who got shorty runnin’ and comin’ in five seconds
Givin’ back shots patch box, fat knots
I rap hot, like black glocks
Disrespect this and get disconnected
Then sprayed like disinfectant
The shit I spit keep my lip infected
I practice safe sex so my dick’s protected
And hold the gat wild, puffin’ fat L’s
Bonin’ a chick listening to Maxwell
On a Maxell, my man called me on a black cell
He told me he got bagged for a crack sell
How ya feelin’ son, not that well
Bustin’ techs and shit
And no matter what sex you is
Behind ya back niggas’ll sex ya bitch
Make you wonder where the exit is
Fuck That, cuttin’ no slack
I’m bustin’ fat nuts on ya back

[Hook x2]
Yo, what it look like
You got crack what it cook like
You gotta track, what’s the hook like
F is off the hook, right
We stole cars while you took bikes
And on a good night, I get ya whole hood sniped

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, what it look like
You got crack what it cook like
You gotta track, what’s the hook like
F is off the hook, right
We stole cars while you took bikes
And on a good night, I get ya whole hood sniped
You’s a half thug, beatin’ ya dick in the bathtub
I get mad love, do a crime won’t get bagged up
Roll in the set, put a hole in ya chest, open ya chest,
Flowin the best, no one contest, I’m blowin’ ya vest
Until I die, I’ll be high off drugs
Money bought me everything but couldn’t buy me love
My niggas blast and shoot cha’ from here to Massachusetts
The cash be ruthless, that’s why ya ass is toothless
You ain’t half as ill as the admiral
You a crab for real, nigga grab ya shield
Rappers wanna kill me and blast me cause my rhymes are filthy
While other niggas are silky and sassy
Upset ya squad, I’ll never wet chu’ God
Y’all niggas ain’t worth a dollar fifty on a Metro card
FUCK THAT!, I bust gats, sit on the side like hubcaps
Never leave home with out the rough raps
Paper, I got to touch that, you want bitches, I want track

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I know this ho that’ll set chu’ up and take ya tech
Then niggas that make you peck to break ya neck
Her mind was the dirtiest
Ever since her pops died on the 30th
She was livin’ the life of unworthiness
Her name was Karen, she drove a black LeBaron
And by the way, she used to sell packs of crack for Aaron
Tyron, do anything to be in a live zone
Smoke five bones then rob the jewelry store for nine stones
Attack ya town, packin’ pounds, smackin’ clowns
Back em’ down like Jackie Brown
You never had skill, I’m mad ill like an overdose of Advil
Killer at will

[Hook x2]

Fuck That, true criminal
F-F gonna hold this down
Fuck That, true criminal
F-F gonna hold this down
Fuck That, true crimina
F-F gonna hold this down
Fuck That, true criminal
F-F gonna hold this down
Fuck That, true criminal
F-F gonna hold this down

[Mr. Voodo]
Natural Elements, the name of this topic
You should pay close attention how we rock it
When we drop the album and single, you should cop it

[A Butta]
Yo Voo, stash that, L hit em wit 2 Tons

[L-Swift]
Yo, first and foremost
Natural Elements serve a raw dose
You ain’t hear the first time, so I return wit more dope
And I just burned some raw smoke, Voo else wit a ?a-sand?
Like a life-size statue of Elvis in Graceland
The fucker of jakes, they rush the gates
But all they find in my pocket was two dutchies, a razor blade, and some 
duct-tape
So if you’re lookin for a cut face and broken jaw
Make you feel like you was locked upstate, and close the door

[Mr. Voodo]
Pope John Paul, I bless ill figures (reputedly)
Dons fall when I caress steel triggers (rufusly)
Anonymously, toss shots wit an ominous force night
Not know two MC’s, draw guns wit two’s a piece
Your whore’s is chossin me, rap wars is losin me, a true MC
My influence be showing and fluently

[A Butta]
True indeed, I flows by properly hop
Go-go’s coppin your spot
Yo whatever we drop, you know it’s gotta be hot
Blazin, Raisin Hell like Run-DMC 
Sprayin shells till my gun be empty
I heard you want it kid, don’t wait to tell, come and get me
Save your hit for A&R; men
On drums and SP’s, and ACE R-10’s
Former friend, you can choose one of the two
But think quick before I bruise you in front of your crew
Oh that’s your man? Well I’m sunnin him too
Nuttin to lose, Thelma and who?
Kick in your grill, blood on my shoes
Lyrics is ill, my click chill, while we guzzlin brew
Flip it Swift (fuck you want me to do?) it’s on you

[L-Swift]
Police is huntin for Voo
Respond too, yo it’s a Elements world
Elegant words make my legend unfurl
Even melons get bust, hold up nigga several of us
Niggas is jealous as fuck, yo got my metal to bust
Yo tell em what up
(Nah kid, I might touch up the flow)
You freeze like, you was stuck in the snow, duckin the po’

[Mr. Voodo]
What do you know, feet double-O
Bring the apocalypse, the ?accostra? chicks
Hold your babies as hostages
You want hydrogens and oxygens, here’s a large dose
Born-again thug like Carlos
Y’all know the stimulants, inhalin reefer dark ? ?
Over the earth set, trick Jahovah for turf
I’m the ?defairiest?, clap straps and give brothas out of body experience
See we be N-E, we ne-gate the red tape
In the 2 Ton, no one shall ecsape
(So pick a def date, and things get set straight)

[Chorus]
"Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh" 4x
Most of y’all know what shit is exactly about word
"Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh" 4x
Always and forver, Natural Elements no doubt

[L-S] I lost my money on the Knicks
[A-B] I got honeys on the tips
[MrV] I got Rummy on the twist
[L-S] Aiyyo run me on the spin

[A Butta]
My click is heavy-handed
Something ferocious, fuckin toasters
One of the dopest so, but don’t approach this
You want dope? I’ll over-dose this
Propose a toast to candle, the king of smokin roaches
Guns and roses, some say my flows comes from Moses
Puff a whole spliff and let the smoke circulate
Deep throat my flow till you choke, hoe regurgitate
Y’all jokers don’t flow, y’all impersonate
Me and my click, you wanna plead the Fifth?
Open your eyes and read my lips, yo the beef is thick
Heat an ?instant?, must be the sickle if you can see wit this grip
My click flow will make you flee the district

[Mr. Voodo]
You see this biscuit, I love this biscuit
Charlemagne shoved the disc in
Ain’t a sample for me to construct the sickness
The product, the quick hit
Crazy cash, cheese like Stacey Dash
DE’s tryin to trace the stash
We steady lace the hash
Up in spots large as Macy’s bash, triple ?stake?
But anyway, I treat women like I’m Henry VIII

[L-Swift]
Yo, I could never envy a fake, all I could do is rock on
You can reach me at, Natural Elements.com
Log on yo, I do this for the illest in prison
I’m seein both sides of the game like peripheal vision
Shit you think about, I figure in my quickest decision
It’s like I always play the game from a different position
Wit The Charlemagne, I’m playin both sides of the fence
I spoke in my defense, I stay wit low eyes when I’m bent
Yo when, I say N-E I mean Northeast too
Bronx county, Trump found me and he brought me through
Support me too, word up 2 Ton, word up

Chorus *replace "shit" w/ "this"

Yo Fine, did you get em?
(Yo, I just got back from the hardware store, yo
3 bucks a can
I got red, black and green
Ready to do this?)
Word is bond
(Yo, kick it)

[ VERSE 1: YZ ]
I want to see a rap generation throw both hands up in the air
Pump em up like you just don’t care
Run your fingers right through the hair
I mean your weave if you got a weave and if not
A thievin MC, he might just get shot
But not by the bullet from a gun
By the raze of the mental son
On your knees you’re pleading, not bleeding
Punk duties, take heed to proceeding
As I proceed to teach the youth 
You proceed to teach your use-
less pickanniny nigga, here, gimme
The microphone, so I can enlighten your dome
I’m not your daddy, boy, the Son is home
The father’s here to support this
With the Eastside Division I taught this
I’m a prophet and you can’t stop the bumrush
Knowledge of self has finally dawned on us
As I speak self-esteem releases
Brothers and sisters become strong, this eases
My mind a bit, but there’s still more to get with
Place my art in your brain, make you sane again
But refrain from the negative, be sure
After all you have a lot to live for
Cause we built a nation, the center of the world is Africa
This is why they’re after ya
But don’t let racism rule your prism
Some brothers in prison are rough-livin and still givin 
Their all to make sure no other brother’s fallin victim
The wall was empty
And this was in me to give to you
A wall to look up to
So I’m taggin it up

(Writing my name in graffiti on the wall)
(When I put up the wall of words)
YZ is taggin it up
(Writing my name in graffiti on the wall)
(Writings on the wall)

[ VERSE 2: YZ ]
Read the fineprint, now you got it, make sense
Uplift yourself, raise your level of confidence
I put up the wall, a wall you now own
Nurture it, take care of it, carry it home
Then decipher which way is right
And which way is too hype
A lie planted by the devil, a racist
Lied to your face, yet can they still face us?
Trustin us, then I bust caps of rap
They step back cause they don’t understand the plan
No rhythm and the devil can’t hide it
And though some cover it up I look inside em
But then I ride em, guide em to the pit
From which they came from and throw em in it
Then write on the wall how he tried to face me
Locked me in chains to disgrace my African name
But now I’m sane again and I don’t play
So raise your gun while you’re on the run
No son of mine, the Eastside Division will take time
To learn, only concern of a strong mind
Then they’ll proceed to speak, teach you all
They’ve been called to uphold the wall, so yes y’all
By my side the Father this time, your mind is mine
Now so I’m taggin it up

(Writing my name in graffiti on the wall)
(When I put up the wall of words)
Taggin it up
(Writing my name in graffiti on the wall)
(Writings on the wall)

Three weeks, and no speaking for me to see
I was wrong
Playing back in my head the things I said to you
Girl I went too far
When you yelled "I’m leaving"
Fine! But you’re bluffing
Been weeks still you ain’t returned my call
I stayed up every night, I couldn’t sleep
Cause you ain’t here
Wrote crazy longs texts, apologies
But my pride wouldn’t press send
I took for granted your love
See this, what I get is too much
Cause you’re gone

Can I get one kiss?

One kiss
It’ll make this right
Know that you feel it
"I still love you"
from how I kiss your lips
Because me telling you
Don’t seem to work
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

Looking so lost, of course
Cause I ain’t got my queen
Be feeling on my chest
I left my sweat feels like my heart won’t beat
Nowhere else can I find a girl
That’s more perfect.
See I’m hurting like this
Cause I deserve it
Every day no sun
Guess you took that, huh?
Just rain here
I just can’t give up
You mean way too much to me, baby
I promise I will cherish your love
See I wanna change girl, for us
What I wish? That you give me one kiss

One kiss
It’ll make this right
Know that you feel it
"I still love you", from how I kiss your lips
Because me telling you
Don’t seem to work
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

One kiss
It’ll make this right
Know that you feel it
"I still love you", from how I kiss your lips
Because me telling you
Don’t seem to work
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

Just one kiss, one kiss
I’m so sick, my swags off
My girl’s gone, everybody’s noticing
One kiss, one kiss
Got me on punishment
On the count of one I did
See I wouldn’t listen, NO!
Or give you that attention
It’s my fault
I want it like that, not this
Like that, not this\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\xa6
Let’s start it with one kiss

One kiss
It’ll make this right
Know that you feel it
"I still love you", from how I kiss your lips
Because me telling you
Don’t seem to work
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

One kiss
It’ll make this right
Know that you feel it
"I still love you", from how I kiss your lips
Because me telling you
Don’t seem to work
So I guess I gotta show you
That’s why I ask, for one kiss, girl!

Uh, this goes out to
Everybody with they head up
Keep it up baby

[Qua Billz]
How many y’all had ever sleep out on park benches
When cops came we hit the fences
We stole food outta Poppi store e’ryday
He freaked out when his baby girl passed away
I’m sheddin’ tears for my homies who are now gone
If that’s your man get revenge and keep his name strong
She just a victim of the ghetto, and she hate it now
Cause she gettin’ money on the corner and got a baby now
They sprayed us down and used whips but couldn’t hold us back
Don’t be ashamed of where you from and show the world you black
I’m one of the few that could make it out these ghetto streets
Cause I refuse to have to murder just so I can eat
I’m livin’ life like a king cause I’m supposed to
Worship my women like a queen, not a ho you
And I can show you how the definite can feed ya kids
And in return all I ask is that you let me live

[Chorus]
Can I live
One loss I give
Can I live
One loss I give
(I gotta do it, I gotta do it)
Can I Live

[Qua Billz]
I wake up early in the mornin’, five times I will pray
Lord forgive me of my sins, and can I make another day
My hearts bleed for the life that this glamour holds
All the money and the women I think it’s takin’ control
See you a victim of your own life
You didn’t ask God for parents that’ll hit the pipe
For neighborhoods with apartments that were roach infested
For no heat and now you’re telephone’s disconnected
I remember when we had to use candles just for light
Blowin’ out the cold smoke from the bed at night
My whole world’s now, Ramera Tatianna Lawson
I may like bein’ a father, when I ain’t flossin’
But my life’s the only thing that really kept me goin’
Sometimes I still can’t believe that I made it flowin’
I could show you how to be legit as a kid
And in return all I ask is that you can let me live

[Chorus]
Can I Live (Can I Live)
One loss I give (Give oh yeah)
Can I Live (Oh yes)
One loss I give
(I gotta do it, I gotta do it)
Can I live

[Qua Billz]
Death is devine, my rhymes light
Be penetratin’ through your mind like, they highlights
My mic’s like a wrist to me
Simp-e-ly I’ma a man makin’ history
Burnin’ this paper after people gettin’ cancer
Meetin’ these ladies, from the models to the dancers
Takin’ ladies to the clubs, take ‘em to the hotel
The motel, gimme two, so they both yell
Look at me, I got, money, you swear I had a disease
When you need to cut it please, we all in it for G’s
A straight warrior, going out for mine on these streets
Remember when I had to do it for me and my brother to eat
But I ain’t never looking back cause all the problems is gone
‘Scept all my people keep on dying when all the babies is born
I changed the styles without a tool, favor and dad’s call
It’s a long way to Heaven, but it’s longer to fall

[Chorus to fade]

[Qua Billz over chorus]
This goes out, to the recent Notorious B.I.G.
And Tupac Shakur, put ya guns down yo
Time for us to start gettin’
We deserve it baby
Keep ya head up

[Co$$]
They call me gladiator, daddy made a hard hitter
Walk with a limb like a pimp do
A skitzo and a mental
When I’m hitting on that indo
They say I’m too complex
I gotsta simplify the info for the dummies and the bimbo’s
I be running laps, running, burning wax with my murder raps
Any beat you put me on is homicide, I murder tracks
Feel the heat, still the illest villain on a killing spree
That steal a female from a nigga, if she feeling me
Who the shit, who the fuck you think Co$$ you the shit
The coolest kid, the ruler is back, bout to do it big
Daddy’s back, sitting on chrome in my Cadillac
She don’t call me Co$$, she calls me Daddy Mack, I likes that
Live and fo’ to five
Flow and rise and take the knife back
My super duper lines scalt your eyes and leave your sight black
I got the coldest sound, speed it up and slow it down
It really don’t matter, either way it’s going down

Yeah, nigga, we still out smoking that weed
Dranking that drank
Been up and stay up working hard mothafucka
That’s right, shit

[Chuck D]
Yo check this out
This is Chuck D, bringin the noise right here
with my man, Blitz the Ambassador right here
Native Sun, that’s right, check check it out
It’s not where you from, it’s where you at

Ay, it’s not where you from, it’s where you at
Chuck D right here

Da Argument
The Argument number two

[Zigg Zagg]
And where was you last night
You know I hit you ‘bout like one o’clock
And if you don’t know by now, you put me on the spot
I’m fed up, shit, tired, sick and I can’t even breathe
‘Bout to put myself in prison and do you off in yo sleep
What was you thinkin?
You smell like stank ass bitch right now
What was you drankin?
Don’t apologize, I’m packin up for a while
I can’t believe it you given away a whole zip for a dub
And to the hoe you spent the night wit
Hide
Cause push comes to shove
Blood runs much thicker than water, but don’t wash
Next time you feelin sad and look over at me, I don’t talk
Two kids and twelve years, but still I can’t get the respect
This whole relationship thing to me is like a comedy act
You keep complainin at me night after night
I’ma leave and you be framin me wit all dis bullshit
I just can’t breathe
And you be blamin me for what you be doin
I’m leavin please don’t try to call me on my personal time
That’s what I mean

[Brotha Lynch]
It’s like therapy
See you can sit there and stare at me
You can even smell me
Go ‘head you can tell me
Only time you see me get jealous is when you fuckin up
I trust you ‘round the fellas
Better toughin up
Or get tossed up, this ain’t no soap opera
This ain’t O.J. & Nee-Cole
Creep up and pop ya, smashin in the Bronco
End up getting locked up
Run up to the enemy and he end up getting socked up
I ain’t got no money for Cochran, no matter what you talkin
Don’t make come at you with the glocked in like McGlockton
I smoke to much weed and they gon’ take my kids
I’ma have to make you bleed, I can’t let you live
Makin dem baby mama ribs after all these years
You didn’t know it, I was a psycho killin wit all these tears
Blood type O, cryin when I killin
Huggin my babies and now I’m cryin when I’m killin
Jeah

[Chorus]
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Um, you don’t know me, but a few years ago I killed your husband, and I am so very very sorry
(Lady crying) - What is this some kinda of sick joke
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Oh no, I’m completely serious!
(Lady cries)
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
I feel better already!

[Zigg Zagg]
A damn shame it’s been a waist of my lifetime
I cry myself to sleep when you come back so late at night
I got no feelin for you sometimes
Can’t lie, but wouldn’t mind pullin the chain
So just maybe I that I might just shoot one off into the brain
51/50 you made it so likely nothin could matter
These bitches hittin you at 3 in the A.M. and what they after
I’m vicious and my patience is low, tryin to let you know
So don’t come lookin for me after the show
You heard me beggin, and just this one last time
Show you what you about to be missin, I’m on a mission
When you hit from behind, you get the vision
Baby stickin ‘em and thinkin’ you fine
But just you listen, cause I’m shinin’ baby commitin a crime
And man you slippin

[Brotha Lynch]
Everytime I come home, same ole shit
You ain’t satisfied until I leave ya anal split
I know you ain’t gon’ get it until I ram it down ya throat
I know you ain’t gon’ lick it, I know you ain’t gon’ choke
But I’ma hit the G note, and that’s gon’ settle thangs
And you can leave broke, leave those metal thangs up out that shit
Unless somebody come trip, then I’ll rock that shit
That’s on Crip
Don’t make me act so stiff, I’m a NWA
I was in trouble yesterday, and in trouble today
And it ain’t gon’ change, I spray thangs
So baby don’t say thangs, ‘bout to make it bang.

[Chorus]
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Um, you don’t know me, but a few years ago I killed your husband, and I am so very very sorry
(Lady crying) - What is this some kinda of sick joke
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
Oh no, I’m completely serious!
(Lady cries)
(Voice of the Bride of Chucky)
I feel better already!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Chorus - 2X]
2Mex falcon gentle
The outcome is mental
Inner visions of anarchism essential
From inside the mouth of south central
Which side of your soul should I attend to?

[Verse 1]
Die in a rush never painted with a (?) brush
just like you fearing god was my high school crush
misunderstood up at the prom
misunderstood up under a bomb
still they deliver the silver sonnets
shiver and quiver if you really were ever honest
never was never really upon us
forever was cleverly thrust upon us
gray patients I stay ancient
decayed saint ships
a vapor ray trips in the middle of arcade flips
in a way its our art our came well equipped
I’m buying red don’t die on your bed know that I am what’s said
code of Zion misled
for I am stormberg
now conformist warm words
torn disturbed the laughing sunrise
collapsing lung size
grasping rasping tongue tied
robots can’t feel it in here
boy copy imperial theater

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 2]
Lunar solburn balloon into the auburn
crimson maroon the edge is all burned
over done orange
brothers and sisters over the sun
we will find the courage
to reconnect with the umbilical
to see corrected stand at the pinnacle
if you can memorize your own pin code
then you can energize your within soul
my words of hope they tour the scope
of what you think is hardcore dope
the assorted coats
touchable figure heads
im on the payroll of un touchable bigger heads
im 3 secrets
from losing my life but maybe saving yours today
my rights and wrongs are expandable
tonight’s my songs are what I’m sending you

[Chorus]

[Asher Roth]
Yeah
Aiyyo I plotted to rock, yeah Zach De La Roth
Nottz knockin the knock, the nod never gon’ stop
Yeah they talkin a lot, but ain’t none of its true
When the album is dropped, and then nobody move
Yeah now we’re the cops, enforcin the laws
So we get behind bars, a new sheriff in charge
Get arrested for fraud, fake rappers get mauled
Gnawed on, eaten and clawed, beaten in brawl
Nottz riggedy raw, Roth kid is a boss
Gettin bigger than some tits that couldn’t fit in the bra
Yeah I’m fittin to crawl, if my legs cut off
Still finish before sprinters by the end of the song
Y’all been gettin me wrong, think I’ll never get on
Empathetic with a sentence cause I’m reppin the lawns
Front back, fuck that if you think that I’m soft
Take a skull clean off, sip your brain through a straw
Aww, naw, real dangerous dog
Let Nottz tell ‘em all we ain’t playin wit’chall

[Nottz]
Yeah; Mr. Roth hold up, heavy as the elephant
Dumbo flow, go oh so nuts
People think I’m heaven sent the way I walk on water
Bitch I spit like yo bitch, cock suck
Fuck you pussy, I’m far from celibate
We hot, you not, but that shit’s irrelevant
Thought I’d just mention it, so you won’t get the shit
twisted or backwards wit’cho dyslexic ass
You jackass, you jack for ass
I don’t give a bitch jack for ass
I’m a hit with the hoes, ya momma know
Knock ‘em down like dominoes
Dick game proper tall and slim like Fillmo’
Jam it in the gut ‘til they feel mo’ pain
Muh’fucker I only use a third of my brain
Therefore kiddo, I’m clinically insane
Every morning hook the jumper cables up and start the brain
Electrify, drink Red Bull and pesticides
and goat milk, tell me dog can you stomach this?
So sick like a kiddie on Christmas
didn’t get shit for Christmas but broke shit
I’m far from broke bitch, catch a boat where I’m at
Asher and Nottz, raw fo’sho’, real rap y’know?

{*scratches to end*}

[Vents]
My rhyme like a virus that modify what you’re taught
Sodomise your thought, your brain wave contort
Twist your T cell, transmit the germ
Transfer the pain to your nerves to burn
My bacteria penetrate birth canal
So you predisposed to perverted sound
They put a serum in your vein to curb the strain
Press rewind, take in the germ again
Protein coat the cell, protect the rhyme
Bootlegging an epidemic, who next in line?
Enzyme infect, venom is in the deck
Pressing eject, your radio start to sweat
Temperature risen, organism react to stress
Damage your brain whenever the words manifest
I’m killing whatever, keeping you under the weather
till Re-Animator putting your body back together

[Chorus: 2X]
We reproduce, multiply like a virus
Death reside in your diets
Blinded by science, lost in the land of the giants
Doing my time with the tyrants

[Vents]
They keep running for vaccine to combat the tag team
Barefoot on the beach? Hell of a bad scene
Dentists gone mad, giving you bad dreams
Doctors terrify with tools that ain’t clean
My virus designed to make clones to imitate
The strength of my plague survive on your dinner plate
The black death, bubonic outbreak
Wonder how long disease in the cow take to work
Checking your watch, wait around
till the men in the white coats strap you down
Germ warfare ain’t a joke
unless you’re George Bush, the Queen or you stay with the Pope
My DNA strand stay banned
Coming out your deck, turn your fucking town to a wasteland
If you thinking that the Vents trying to marry ya
Open up, get bumped by the carrier

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
Hey, the Funkoars clique got the germ!
And the Hilltop crew caught the germ!
The Crossbred Mongrels got the germ!
My man Balboa caught the germ!
The Hospice Crew catching the germ!
Overproof caught the crew!
And the Terra Firma crew got the germ!
Of course the Vents, bro I got the germ!
Check it ouuuuut!
One, two, Vents One
Mr. Triiiials in effect like a virus
Moving real, real, real, real slow
Taking over, ‘06 and beyoooond!
Word ‘em up

(Several voices overlap)

[Buckshot]
To the weak what we do buck \xc2\x91em down word life

Look, I don’t preach, but I do teach
MY little homies in the hood how to outreach
And how to move your mouth piece cause
A closed mouth never get invited to the feast
I enlighten the streets, give them a chance
At the same time give them new rhythms to dance
To, my black people, we not equal
Ain’t nothing sweet in the street when they stopping you
Know the reason I’m pulling over and seeing the sirens
Ask me where I been but listen that’s my biz
My formula stays call and cool
Cause if I, break fool and put my hand on my tool
I’m going to jail for real for attempt to murder
Police is shootin’ niggas on sight now, word up
Think they all drinkin’ syrup so they got excuses
Putting bullets in your back, bullet shot in your gooses
But, I keep it moving like a highway
My way’ll get the job done, call it Formula 1
Cause hey, hey

It’s the formula, the formula (8X)

The formula, stay true never tell
Some of my dudes throwin’ they best friends in jail
(Formula) Stay productive never lazy
I fucks with the haze ire, but that’s ok with me
(Formula) To make it happen when your broke
Cause when your hear fix ya face, I’ll slide the gold
(The Formula) How to reap what you sow
How to chief whatchu grow while your beats just blow
(The Formula) Need another lesson I’ma give it to you
Uh, uh... that’s how I did it to you
(The Formula) I break it down, by the uh, by the pound
So, uh, stick around, it’s the Formula

It’s the formula, the formula (8X)

First Verse [Juvenile]:

Betrayal, for the decline in drug sales,
War over turf here will cause more drama than Waco,
That’s why I lay low, and try to improvise on all your weak spots,
See what the street got,
For me maybe two cheap glocks,
For free, Benjamin Franklin, currency,
Is used to pay bills and insurance to bury me,
I’m magna to carta player haters don’t bother me,
Y’all oughtta be, rollin’ shipments instead of quarter ki’s,
It was told to me,
Ca$h Money connect from overseas,
Two tons of white ones and maybe,
But then they might come so I’ma,
Take preparation,
Pick out a proper, stash location,
Fill it with choppers and watch them,
Narcotic cases, undercovers investigatin’,
Yo Russ, where the man with the dope?  I’m startin’ to get impatient,
Two days blew by, our package arrived,
Followed by, a call from the boss for me to do a homicide

Second Verse [Magnolia Shorty & B.G.]:

[Magnolia Shorty]

Chillin’ in my hood, while you know it’s all good,
Camoflauged down to the socks with some soldier reeboks,
I got’s to play it like that, cuz I’m a soldier for real,
I told you once I was a soldier, bitch you bout to get killed,
That’s the deal for ‘96, cuz you know we ain’t playin’,
Go and run and panic now you better throw up your hands,
And if you stunt, you know I’ll catch you, know what I mean?

[B.G.]

Slip on them chucks in the cut...

[Magnolia Shorty]

At that C.Y.C.
Magnolia soldier, don’t you doubt it, I thought you knew we bout it,
A bunch of bout it muthafuckas, smoke weed and get, out it,
Throw your head up stand tall, and stand big and fuckin’ loaded,
I’ma represent where I’m from, the home of the soldiers

Third Verse [B.G.]

B.G. off the top bout drama,
And I’ma, duct tape a nigga Mama,
Forgot her, 
Cuz I, be off in the World gat tore,
G’s I’m bout 4, S.K. clips I unload,
I’m floatin’ all through that U.P.T.,
Represent V.L. street slangin’ heat, you weak,
A T-shirt with your face on it,
I find out where your set at, I run up on it,
Meet us outside, you know that’s All On U,
They all die ain’t no stuntin’, do what I gotta do,
Game tight when I write, write get a nigga hype,
Niggas buckin’ through the crowd, startin’ a war fight,
Pop, pop clear the block,
Your glocks ain’t cocked,
I make the spot hot, jump out and straight chop,
Respect the young nigga, get plum dumb nigga,
Shots comin’ from drums, nigga who want beef with me?
If you want beef, then brang it,
I don’t just sang it, gunshots be rangin’,
Money and bitches, houses and fly cars,
Rottweilers in the yard, also security guards,
Big money heavyweight, got ki’s and G’s,
Got cake for days, give it to the B.G.’z,
I keep it real this life, a straight muthafuckin’ solja
We puttin’ tons of coke in the Magnolia

[Ominous Voice]

Magnolia SHORTY!!!
SHORTY!!!
SHORTY!!!  (6x)
Mac Melph Calio for life

[Killa Tay]
I’m at the point of no return, fuck what you talkin’
I want money like Big Worm, I ain’t tryin’ to get burned
I learned the hard way so now everyday is a holiday
It’s dirty, but it’s the game that we gotta play
It’s all the same from L.A. to the Bay
??? full of pot heads chasin’ the pain
They say the streets ain’t safe, so everybody ride strapped up
??? got it locked, locked the block it’s like that
I got goons posted up at the room
Still coming home smellin’ like gun powder and perfume
Still real from the womb to the tomb
I bring goons, still riding, signing autographs shining like the moon
Step wrong,I light up your life like Pat Goon
Don Dada when the gat boom
Read the headlines, niggaz doin’ fed time stuck in the prison
That ain’t livin’, I know you probly felt like snitchin’
But read what you saw that’s what the good book tell us
If you ain’t M-O-B, you either shook or you jealous
‘Cause we ain’t playin’ with Pellut Guns, you suckas keep bumpin’ ya guns
So now you finally gettin’ fucked like Nuns
It’s halocaust, we gon’ hall ‘em off
All that floss got you headed on a one way trip to a coffin
Fuck talkin’ I’m walkin’ front line with Bo
Until my shine don’t glow or it’s my time to go
But...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[Yukmouth]
Geah.. nigga
Spark the ganja up, H2 Tonka truck
26 deep dish make my shit look like a monster truck
Gettin’ swallowed up by a gangsta bitch, Gobble up
Y’all be givin’ dollas up for pussy, Bitches sponsor us
In the Mob we trust it’s the Mafia, La Kosta Nostra
Lots of Coke and lots of Doja, Lots of Souljas
Mobstas focus, in drops and Rovers
Front work to the block controlla, let him rock ‘n roll ya
Carson Daly, flossin’ daily, and drive Mercedes it ain’t all gravy
Fuck y’all pay me, cross the Mob lose your broad and baby
Police they all hate me, I ball like McGrady
And I’m the one like "Neo", still Desert Eagle
Keep throwin’ bricks like Shaquille at a free throw
Yuk and C-Bo the sequel
Made niggaz that’ll have ya wacked like the Beatle in Casino
Nigga...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[C-Bo]
Got the Benz on 20’s, the Porsche on 19’s
10 Millimeter clips extended to 19’s
Ya never ever cross a killa that’s like me
Tank top, white tee, jeans and Nike’s
Bangin’ since the first day Reagen got elected
Yeah, since the first day AIDS got detected
I ain’t got a problem with touchin’ or bustin’ it’s nothin’
Like AIDS, ya get it like ??? Huston
The vest won’t protect ya, it just slow ya down
Let the gauge racket go up, bet it blow you down
When it come to my money don’t play ho
You’ll have us on your ass like the attack of the killer tomatos
I was born with a halo, turned into horns
Said I was evil my every step would burn through the floor
I’m tired of life, my every turn is to the morgue
Ya little sister grew up in church and turned into a whore...

(Talking about the Mafia)

(Busta Rhymes)
Catching my fever
Rob the passanger, the last griever
You don’t lone my squad? 
Fuck ya’ll, we don’t love your ass neither
Way off the meter

(Rampage)
Yo Bus, me and Spliff, we got heaters
Everything’s allright, lets get drink up inside of Cheetah’s
Go up in Cheetah’s...

(Spliff Star)
... and see this motherfucker named Peter
Tried to stick me for five bricks but his broads the schemer

(Rah Digga)
Word is bond, I murder any bitch that fuck with my niggas

(Rampage)
Blow a hole up in your body, straight dismantle your figure

(Busta Rhymes)
A’yo where Rah Digga?

(Rah Digga)
Scopin out the little blaze chicken
Bitch stay trickin’
Fuckin with my niggas, gonna get her face kicked in

(Busta Rhymes)
A’yo Spliff, what you starting at?
Them bitches over there 
Or them bitches over there 
Or them bitches right here?

(Spliff Star)
Nah, that nigga on line
Motherfucker still drunk off’a Bacardi and lime

(Baby Sham)
Spliff, I feel this way
If it’s for my squad, let’s play
Back him ‘gainst the door 
Patch his body with gauze
Mop up the floors
Splatter nigga’s blood on the walls

(Spliff Star)
Bust that nigga’s shit
Make the nigga suffer for yours


Busta:  And if they run up in your crib again
        I got your back
Sham:   Always keep the heat on me son
        I got your back
Ramp:   I’ma hold you down until I die

        I got your back

(Spliff Star)
Fuck waiting
Bash his face for a statement
Cock the stainless
Make his whole chest cave in

(Busta Rhymes)
Ooh, shit is changing
My whole adreneline is racing
Blow this nigga shit like horror flicks
Wes Craven

(Baby Sham)
A’yo Bus, Spliff, chill 
(Fuck you talkin’ bout?)
Don’t do that nigga nothing (fuck that!)
Blow that nigga’s family up just for fronting

(Spliff Star)
Yo where the bitch that was with the nigga?

(Rah Digga)
Caught her with the left
Choked her by the halter, bitch bloody to death
Then the ho starts crying ‘bout her hair and nails
Gettin’ stomped with the shells...

(Rampage)
...I heard the bitch-nigga yell
Caught Peter, man, by the speaker
Looked me in the eye and didn’t even know
I was his brother’s keeper
Slap the nigga, through him in the sleeper

(Spliff Star)
Deeper and deeper
Nigga’s vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

(Baby Sham)
Chill, let’s bounce
Spliff is high on ‘bout a half an ounce
If he’s hiding, we gon’ find him on the eye of a needle

(Rah Digga)
Yeah that’s the shit I’m talking bout
Let’s go fuck with his peoples
Nigga got a sister?

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah, she work up in Kids World
I don’t know for sure, but I think the nigga live with is girl

(Spliff Star)
There the nigga goes, let’s hit him with the 4-5 chrome

(Baby Sham)
Chill Spliff, we gon’ trail this nigga’s bitch ass home
Rush the crib

(Rah Digga)
Kill the bitch while she ain’t even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin
Chop the bitch up

(Baby Sham)
Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch’ll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound’ll sniff up

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, bury that bitch, don’t leave a scent for dogs to pick up

(Rampage)
Oh shit, yo I hear somebody coming 
>From the upstairs bathroom where I hear the water running

(Spliff Star)
Fuck that! There the motherfucker go right there
I want a morgue for him, make that nigga’s crew pall-bear
Yo let me lift him

(Rah Digga)
Wait, before that, let me go kiss him

(Spliff Star)
Put five in his head and wrap him in the bedspread
Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

(Busta Rhymes)
My squad sworn to secrecy 
If anybody ask about him we ain’t seen him recently
I got your back

Busta:  Any nigga ever try to front
        I got your back
Sham:   And if you ever need my burner son

Busta:  Let me snuff that nigga talking shit
        I got your back
Shame:  I go against the world for my squad
        I got your back

I got your back (4x)

Wack emcee’s hit the exit.. check it

[Verse 1: Rok One]
Destruction in my appetite, pass the mic and get devoured (?)
(why?) cause I’m emcee to the second power
Twice as nice as you could ever hope to be vocally
I get my runnin’ flow you on a treadmill sportin’ hosiery
Witness how it’s not how it’s supposed to be
Stress through authenticity
Cancel those thoughts that are dissin me (?) instantly
And overcome the victim of the greatest MC war in history
I ‘m handin’ out fatalities to foes, flawless victory
Lies I’m quick to bury, I select words out of the dictionary
To re-write your record review and transform it to your obituary
So here’s your eulogy, who are we? The untouchables
The true emcee’s exposing all you fraudulence like nudity
Bring your lyrics, money, fuck time (?)
I m like a careless cat burglar when I drop the jewelry
Probably the best you ran across
No one can ever show this man who lost
Towards wack MC’s my heart is colder than the Ice planet lost
Sorta like Diana Ross
My flow is nothin short of supreme
Rok-One will forever be in style like denim blue jeans
writin’ rhymes is a daily routine
And my religions refreshing when I’m manifestin’ the blessin I was given
Beatin’ lies with wisdom
My creation transcends and defies the system
Examples of verbal (?) over vibes and rhythms
Not concerned with topping the charts
I m on a higher mission to achieve longevity like the tombs of mummified Egyptians

[Hook]
Ayo when it comes down to it rappers are counterfeit
But rest assured I’m genuine when I rhyme so bounce to this
I manifest hip hop in its highest degree
{"Certified and superior MC"}

Ayo when it comes down to it rappers are counterfeit
But rest assured I’m genuine when I rhyme so bounce to this
Hip hop is something I take very seriously
{"Certified and superior MC"}

[Verse 2: Rok One]
Rok One will leave your head spinnin’ like the boys of rock steady
My rhymes hang out more than breasts on a girl whose top heavy
I m not petty, rappers don’t try: you’re not ready
I m the best from New York to (?) Roxbury
You heard rumors I was nice? Well now you’re certain
I turn psycho on the mic like that man with the knife
behind the shower curtain Norman Bates
Observe my composition as it formulates
MC’s hand in your resignation like Nixon after Watergate
My new releases are razor sharp, reducing you to pieces
Leaving my opponents more confused than juice (?)
I hit harder than an 808, to stay in shape
With a style that’s more off the hook then fish that didn’t take the bait
Don’t playa hate
I stay in charge of my own fate
A lot of brothers try to make hits but couldn’t bring it back to home plate
And on decks the best rehearse with concepts to bless each verse
So well rounded that I should will a contest for wet tee-shirts
Test research indicates that I ‘m ahead of my time
Competitors find it difficult to write shit that’s better than mine
And better my rhymes without the use of reefer, weed or endo
The crowd responds: "Two Thumbs Up!" like Siskle and Ebert eating Mentos

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rok One]
At a show I make even the baddest (?) the status quo
Shining like fourteen carat gold
Never kickin an average flow
In battle mode weak lyricists I’m toe tagging
The highest on the evolutionary chart you herbs the (????)
My flow pattern makes you dig my style like bone fragments
It’s not your ordinary chrome packin thug tryin’ to go platinum
I choose a path that’s holier (step up)
I leave my foes more paralyzed than Peter Parker with arachnophobia
So nice it’s only right that you give me acknowledgment
Freestyle, written, or story telling; got all three I’m the (??)
I get props and respect when hip hop’s in effect
Yo I got tricks up the sleeve even when I’m rockin a vest
I m not a mack but still attractive to the opposite sex
Me and the mic go together like a Rasta with sex
Put down your glocks and your tech’s
I rock without stopping for breath
Been doing this since Flava Flav was wearin clocks on his chest
Fiend for a mic
One of the best you’ve probably seen in your life
My dreams to live right, (?) and have a queen for a wife
Until then I keep on rhyming and exploring the world
Hold my own like ugly fellas who can’t score with girls

[Hook]

[Jehovah’s Boy - Intro]
Yeah, WHOO! (hahaha)
Rizin Sons (yep)
God I thank You for another one (Yes, sir!)
You know You a beast, right?
Look, God can use you in any way shape or form
if you just let Him come in, man
That’s right! But you cain’t be in self; you gotta know this too, listen...
Look...

It’s not about you, it’s about what
the Father, the Spirit, and the Son do
Trinity - the only triangle office I run thru
Game on the line and I know who to go to
and game is life, give it to Christ!
We need to think twice about decisions that we come to
When you club and party or let the Lord use you (c’mon!)
And youth, we need to get our lifestyles up
Don’t worry about go picking them Lifestyles up, feel me?
Think about it as a turnpaper
You gotta have communication, structure, foundation
You want God to speak? Then His voice is the period
Don’t run on with yo sentence ‘cause then you won’t hear Him [You ain’t gon’ hear Him!]
Listen, God’ll be your exclamation point, make your statement stronger
‘cause you don’t want the devil’s comma (nope!)
No more drama, He’ll give you the words to say
When they ask you for your sources, you tell ‘em "Yahweh" and..

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Now it doesn’t mater the time, temperature, or the place
As long as you believe and step out on faith
With God, no discrimination - doesn’t matter you black, white
Dominican Republican or Haitian
God’ll use you in any way, no matter your destination
Even when this altercations are hatin (WOO!)
He’s the reason we have a source of communication
Gave His son to die wit no hesitation!
And Jesus came, turned water to wine
Just one TOUCH from His hand, everything is fine (I thank You, Lord)
Use David in the fight people thought wouldn’t last
So with God on your side, there’s nothing you can’t surpass
HE’S - pure and holy, tried and true
In Chapter 14:26 of Matthew [What’d it say?]
TWO fish, FIVE loaves, fed a multitude
If He can do it for them, then He can do it for you

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Truth be told, workin for God is not simple
But think about the pain and the bloodshed that He went through [Thank You, God]
to save each of us in this world we call sinful
So we need to be strong and hold up GOD’S temple
Like Tim Duncan - keep it strictly fundamental
Stay in your Word and encourage the people with your mentals (yep!)
‘Cause souls can be saved just by hearin what you been through!
God givin you life is not meant to be accidental
Things that go on in the world, very incidental (yeah)
Temptation hits, harder than punches right to the temple
Your soul gives way just like cavities do to dental
That’s why we need Christ just like lead needs a pencil
We are peculiar people that can be difficult
Decisions that need to be made never simple
We were spiritually elected, like the presidential (c’mon!)
So while you’re here on earth, think of where you tryna make it to

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Holla! (WOO!)
Yeah, hahahaha!
Here we go! We got a nice one here, haha!
Rizin Sons, let’s GO! (C’mon!)
Just let Him use you man (C’mon!)
Just let the Lord use you, yep!

[Joyner Lucas]
Stompin all up in the rain, hop up all up in the way
Elephants, a couple lines in a zebra, put the heaters in your face
and leave you with the monkeys with banana clip, it’s funny
Watch ‘em pull apart your little face
And I’ve been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Y’all know what I slay, beast in a cage
Nigga, that’s a-what you call Jumanji, ain’t no new Bugatti’s
Just a deuce deuce shotty, big enough to make Bruce Bruce potty
Turn a Bruce Jenner to a new hobby, I ain’t cool with nobody
I don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul nigga, even let the Grim Reaper know nigga
Put it on my tombstone when I die here, take a step inside of my world
27 years, sellin cut the bull and now they call the bitch my girl
You are now looking at a monster - 85 teeth, 39 deep
26 piece, run and light a fuckin military with a M-16
Influenced by George Bush, burn your whole city with a blowtorch
Then I ride out in your tour bus and I hop out in a Porsche truck
Like BLOAW~! Black tie swagger, Black pride nigga, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\xaa#\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x8eBlackLivesMatter\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\xac
Black eye shadow, black nine barrel, BANG! BANG! Move back, my nigga!
Why lie? Every night I pray to my God
I don’t gotta wait, you blah-blah and I never gave 2 cacas
I’m a heavyweight new prime time in an MMA fight with a +Kimbo Slice+ to your neck
Then I put my fuckin life in a script, it’s a movie put my life in the shit
Pack a Mac and we could get it crackalackin
back when I was tryna make a habit happen
Nothing out of nothing, have a shot at rapping
and if the doesn’t happen, I’ma stack it
‘Til I turn a packet into another packet
‘til I stack it up and cop a cabin big enough
To put a fucking bomb inside it, and blow flames on a fire, be the dragon
Bin Laden ain’t got SHIT on me!! I don’t think you understand
You are really lookin at the devil nigga, I don’t think you wanna dance
Meet me in the clouds and the smoke nigga, ho nigga you ain’t never stood a chance
You ain’t never-you ain’t never coulda been, shoulda been, woulda been
Look at him, Joyner Lucas stompin all up in your face, poppin all up in the bass
Elephants, a couple lines in a cheetah but the heaters in your face
and leave you with the monkeys with banana clip, it’s funny
Watch ‘em pull apart your little face
And I’ve been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Y’all know what I slay, beast in a cage
Nigga, that’s a-what you call JUMANJI!!!

[Joyner Lucas]
Me and my bitch against y’all, so fuck you and yo’ in-laws
Never grew up on Crenshaw, but I grew up on menthols
And I smoke ‘tll my fuckin lungs squeeze and I choke ‘til my fuckin tongue bleed
In the carpet of yo mom’s crib ‘til your tubs leaks on them love seats
And this must be what it feels like when you full force that I’m dead right
And you dead wrong and I’m here like what my hands wrapped around his
Like God-DAMN~!! Black tie swagger, Black pride nigga, #BlackLivesMatter
Black eye shadow, black nine barrel, BANG! BANG! Move back, my nigga!
This is more than a board game, a Jumanji with a little more fang
The gorillas hookin like a torpedo finna knock up on ya fuckin door frame
Not a problem you was just a floor stain, at the bottom of the ground I’m walkin on
I betcha momma teach you not to talk a lot, I betcha ya dog’ll teach you not to bark a lot
A lot niggas gotta get it, I’ve been tryna get it, I’ma tell you ‘bout it if you got a minute
Got a minute? ... Aiyyo, you got a minute, my nigga?
Yo...yo, you got a minute? ...Aight
Back when Iverson was in his prime
I was writing, I ain’t wanna get a job
I was dream chasing, I was gettin mine
You was sleeping, I was tryna get in line - nigga, WOO!!!

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo, Joyner!
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
when you rollin that dice on that Jumanji game, my nigga

[Busta Rhymes]
(GET ‘EM!!) If you try stoppin us, I’ll turn into a fuckin rhinoceros
And put a dick inside of yo’ esophagus
And poppin shit and moppin up a nigga, cock another glocka

When I follow, beat you like ya fadda
Like it’s no tomorrow, bitch you wanna swallow?
Holla, holla, holla, HOLLA!
(GET ‘EM!!) If you try stoppin us, I’ll turn into a fuckin rhinoceros

[Big J]
Im a BIG GOD and I do BIG thangs
Im the King of all kings, Jesus above all names
Let my name reign, I raise the sunshine
so you can rest, I give you nighttime
Hosanna in the highest to be saved
Im the only one in 3 days to get up from the grave
I am, every time you think
but I am a jealous God, but I still let you speak
I am the LORD of Host, I gave you the Holy Ghost
So you dont have to stress I wanna keep you blessed
I DONT WANT KNOW ROBOT PRAISE!
If there’s no heart felt and there’s no hands raised
since Genesis 1 I predestined you son
To have a free will so you could worship real
I am the great Elshadi
I CAN HEAR YOU WHEN YOU CRY
Love me and dont worry when you die

[Chorus]

[Jaz]
Im the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end
I created all things and you can still call me friend
I took the dust of the earth and formed and molded mankind
I give strength to the weak and give sight back to the blind
the earth is mine and the fullness that you see
Im the only one that can set your living soul free
eternity I hold in the palm of my hand
from your veins to joins your muscles and your glands
that I AM who can stand before the might one
before your blueprints were sketched in heaven is was done
so wont you come to the chancerllor the counserlor
any questions that you have I know I’ll answer ya
I’ll stand for ya and fill you with my presents deep inside
I gave Moses the power to make the Red Sea divide
and to Pharaoh I turned a snake from a rod
So hands down and bow down and say I Am God

[Chorus]

[Big J and (Jaz)]
Let’s finish off with the light of Isreal
(Matthew 1:23 my names’ Emmanuel)
The star out of Jacob and the Chief, the Messiah
{The true inspirator, yah the real Bible writter)
I created the heavens just a climpse of my power
(the breath of life, the king, the high power)
the strength to the poor, God’s unspeakable gift
(The Lilly of the valley the name you should uplift)
I am eternal life, upholder of all things
(Im the banner of the nations the only King of all kings)
Im the lawgiver, call me the Most High
(The only one who that sent his son for you to die)
Im the God of all grace
I put the shine on Moses’ face
(I sit my throne apon Zion, and let the angles take their place)
And to saved face Im your healer if you only have faith
(I will fill your statisfaction so wont you come and have a taste)

[Chorus]

[Diamond]
Yeah, this is Diamond D this is how it’s going down
My boys from North Kakalaki, Yaggfu Front, freaking all the stunts

\tIt’s the Yaggfu Front, freaking all the stunts
\tStepping with the loot and hitting the blunts (Repeat 2x)

[Jingle Bel]
I gets mad freaks to this beat, it’s a pleasure
grammar leisure, and start motivatin concentratin
On the *DJ cuts*, can you hear it?
Spin 4th diggin in nuff crates, so great
Oh golly jesus snow is handed and demanded so I supply the
one of da tings, to da vibe
I’m fly, like Jimmy’s snooker with ass like TJ Hooker
So book em, Dano, voice soprano, break the glass
on the mantle, cause my flow lasts for miles like the Nile
Make the people say AOWWWWW!
And I’m a black man Egyptian lover
Pharoah bone dig dugger, skirt tugger, this is butter
Cause many bust with gimmicks so now I’m livid
So now you’re forgiven
Cause way back Jack you came slack on the help
why play yourself, go play somebody else!
I got the rhymin skills and I gotta
The super fat rhymes and lines and I gotta, bo bo
for the niggaz who pop shit like gum
Do come like a penis get kicked, in the anus
Play famous, and you gets nowhere (uh-huh)
Who cares about a punk who talks junk?
You’re silly

\tIt’s the Yaggfu Front, freaking all the stunts
\tStepping with the loot and hitting the blunts (Repeat 2x)

[Spin 4th]
Well it’s the rippin rebel and ruckus sport the rhymin rap 4th Spin
Uncanny most ability to split my verse at will
I slam through the home like a photon phaser beam
While fools decay like children’s teeth on Halloween
Straight from Princeton it’s ridiculous rhymes live
So get up off the beach, cause I’m coming high tide
with the force of the fart of a flatulating Batman
Obese I release vocal fury (nice sack man)
Kick this in Cato, burn this in Waco
Trippest in potato, or maybe even microbe
Silicon bass like a breast up in Cali
Greedy like Rally’s, cajun chicken meal
Is this kid for real?  Am I really ill?
No, this is my regular flow
So if I was to flip, you’d hear some CRAZY shit
Like how, now brown, cow, wow I’ll, pow
Here is the face, come with the bass
Face case and race, you’re dead!
Get away from the motherfuckin spin
So you would ask when did this nigga, begin
to get the freestyle, not really, not really
Spin 4th fool, I’m smackin niggaz silly

[Diamond]
Ayo I’m chillin with the kids from North Kakalaka
Girl you love my bedroom made of black and lacquer
So jump to it stunt cause I got what you want
And bring three chicks for the Yaggfu front
You’ll scream "Hallelujah" baby if you let me do ya
Just hold ya ankles and I’ll run right through ya
Moans and groans reverb throughout the house
Forget about your worries, your son, and your spouse
Lay you the carpet, don’t say stop it
I got the cord, let me plug it in your socket
Tell your moms that you’re working late
I know you’re strung cause the sex is great
And tell your man you need money to eat
And we can spend it on our weekend retreat
No regrets as you wipe your sweat
I got the stamina of a Vietnam vet
If the trenches, I do it on the benches
In the park, when it gets dark
Or in the crib, so save the women’s lib
Cause you got the key, peace from Diamond D

\tWoooooooooooooo! (Repeat 4x)

[Damage]
Flavorific, to be specific hot damn I’m spicy
There’s four of us my dick is long a-bolish niggasaurus
I absorb it cause I’m forest, sporest, fuck you
I span the globe to storm like Hurricane Andrew
Super rhyme ripper clipper break a nipple tweaker
A friction equal when she meets the big heat seaker
We could cruise booze when I swing my verbal news
Extra extra lyrical setter tears your sneakers with no feature
It’s the creature from the swamp, as I romp on rabblerousers
Trouble make us take a stand, as I command the sample houses
We don’t pillage and raid, we take a plate and then rotate it
If it’s rugged then we scoop it then truncate it then we loop it
then we drag it, the kids from Cakalak are comin with force
Mr. Spin the broken reigner, and my man from over the chorus
And the man whose name stands for, massive wide destruction
it’s my instruction to combine incredible rhymes and spits ill production
It’s the muddy marsh givin creeper, passin the grim reaper
Your mother and my closet keeper *beep beep beep* excuse me that’s my beeper
So I think you hear me knockin and I’m comin in with the crew
That creates more tracks, than horses make glue
So, on with the who, and ninety-one to willy nilly
Huh!  Damage slappin motherfuckers silly

[Pete Nice]
Wisdom fatter than Buddha, ain’t a heroin
Shooter or a storefront looter
Truer than a polygraph, walk with the big staff
But yo I got tricks up my sleeve you never thought I had
Do you like Muhammed Ali doing Liston
Take you to the cleaners like the pants that you pissed in
It’s in poor taste why you’re so busted
I got loot like a frank got mustard
Yeah, you run games but you ain’t got equipment
All you got is kneepads for the sipping
I’m flipping you like Marv Albert on a slow-mo
The Prime Minister kicks the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I’m thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Swift on the steel and prepare to rip mics
It’s the Prime Minister, the Minister Pete Nice
I’m soul flexin’, never had the specs in
20/20 vision, bust rhymes like erections
Wrecks in sleeper, never had a beeper
Ain’t going out like a 40-deuce peeper
Thumbs get picked if you say you’re plumb pickin’
No prejudice, black, white, or Puerto Rican
Moist moist plumbs, kinda swollen yup swollen
Kick the bobo then it’s plumb’s that you’re holding
Domes get filled, 3 minus 1 equals 2
Daddy Rich knows what’s true (Indeed)
What’s that I hear? Are you broke, I’ll make you broker
Lifespan dwindles like a candlestick smoker
Get a little taste of the Minister of Mojo
Quick on the solo, kicking all the bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I’m thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

Back to the point, I bring you back to the point and
Hard to keep it true when the others are exploiting
Never got sidetracked, the others got punched black
Many fell victim, and fell into the booty shack
Make ‘em disapper like the Brooklyn Dodger
Swinging on my thing, I swing ‘em just like Roger
Don’t sweat Madonna, Madonna got a bony ass
If you gotta pass gas, better leave the room fast
Bobo kicked like the bo that you be licking
What came first, yo, the pigeon or the chicken?
Do with the suspense, y’all, but I ain’t hip
Cock going on tour a couple times around the block
Daddy Rich and Pete Nice never steer you wrong, B
Fatter than the fat kid in PM Dawn
Long time coming like skins to Quasimodo
So let’s all kick the Willie Bobo

Kick the bo bo bo, I kick the bobo
I kick the bobo, I’m thinking of kicking the bobo (Repeat 4x)

[ VERSE 1: Sinquis ]
Listen to my metaphor, I make it better for
Except my competator, cause she’s headed for
Destruction, and I could never be a substitute
I go off just like a 99 gun salute
Let me be candid, I gotta hand it
To myself, I’m so good, I can’t stand it
You can’t top it, the thought - drop it

Stop frontin, we ain’t jokin

Cause when it comes to this it’s strictly biz

[Chorus]

As soon as I came out the womb, my momma knew a star was born
Now I’m on the golf course, trippin wit the Osbournes
I seen the show wit Travis Barker, rock star mentality
I’m jumpin in the crowd just to see if they would carry me
Bitches wanna marry me, they see me they just might panic
My ice make em go down quick, like the Titanic!
yeah, I’m wit Da Shop Boyz, you know what we do
I’m surfin screamin "Cowabonga, TOTALLY DUUUDE!!"

Chorus

Chicago Bears, all around the city we’re pumped to make a run
Da Bears Da Bears,
It’s been awhile since 85 so we want another one
Chicago Bears
We’re bearn down, Get to the back you bandwagon fans
We’re bearin down, We’re fighting hard to be champions
So if you love Chicago, if you love Chicago, if you love Chicago
Say Da Bear Da Bears

1st verse

Chicago Bears! You scared?
You know our defense is like leaches and that’s hard to wear
cover two coupled with couple dudes on the line who will muscle through
and make any loud mouth eat humble soup
full back see that blitz he might be scared and sue
prepare to lose.
THE BEARS Bob Swerksi style
Chi Town full of super fans shout longer than rocky rounds Wipe me down
running back hit back in this here hockey town so copy down
You might need some help to bring them down
Air it out play fake them bet our receivers shake them
We’re bout that football LIFE
expecting greatness and hating any loss of a fight
From north C-H-I, to the south side
We’re reppin orange blue and you know our futures bright
Lets win a super bowl, Like 85
Make the city proud, and keep sweetness alive
So say the Bears the Bears now Say Chicago Bears (The Bears)
Now say the Bears the Bears now say Chicago Bears (The Bears)

Chorus

2nd verse

Where my monsters of the midway?
From past to present day
Ditka to Lovie to Gayle Sayers to Forte
Get ready to rumble we gon crush you
Hustle and muscle for every yard
Touchdown, Super bowl Shuffle
The 85 trophy is getting kind of lonely
Down there in Halas Hall, let’s get the stats involved
17,000 yards from Peyton let’s get the facts involved
We’re the best in the league on special teams true or false?
All around the city we stand together to show our support
The only division we want is the NFC north
We coming for the ring, we gon take it by force
I believe in the dream, I pledge allegiance to team,
And the city, the whole sport!
Don’t catch us on Solider Field you Goldie Locks came home to eat
All throughout our history we love victory can’t take defeat
You boy’s better get scared run home to your mamas - we’re the team to fear
Throw your hands up in the air, And represent Chicago Bears!

Chorus

3rd Verse

C-H-I-C-A-G-O
I rep the Bears until the day I fold
Wouldn’t even care if it’s ten below
I’m still jumping all up in the snow
Its game time like 85, Champions we come to ride
Coming for the ring so BYE BYE!
Up the field touchdown
Field goals they all good, never gotta worry put ya hands up
Defense get getting buck, ready to tear the field up
Ready for the ino, Ready for the sack, Ready for the touchdown
Ready run it back. Safeties and fumbles yeh we on all of that.

Bridge

We coming for that number one spot
Cuz honestly number two aint hot
Either you is or you’re not,
Either you is or you’re not.
We coming for that number one spot
Cuz honestly number two aint hot
Either you is or you’re not,
Either you is or you’re not!!!

Chorus (x2) with Dan’s Guitar Solo

[Verse 1]
I’ve never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I’m not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song’s like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin’ in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin’ the hotel room
We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody’s like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don’t care, we aren’t caught up in your love affair

And we’ll never be royals (royals)
It don’t run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain’t for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I\xc2\x97we’ve cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we’re fine with this
We didn’t come for money

But every song’s like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin’ in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin’ the hotel room
We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody’s like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don’t care, we aren’t caught up in your love affair

And we’ll never be royals (royals)
It don’t run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain’t for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We’re bigger than we ever dreamed
And I’m in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren’t caught up in your love affair

And we’ll never be royals (royals)
It don’t run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain’t for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule
Let me live that fantasy

[Hook - 2x]
The world may spin, the sun may shine
Get it how you live, or get it how you die
You can live for the future, or you can dwell on the past
But long as I’m around, I’ma mash for my ca-ash

[Dougie D]
The world spins, 365 times
360 of em, Dougie on grind
Massaging my mind, with the cattle stannous with pine
24/7, pushing and pumping to get mine
I ain’t never fin to quit, I ain’t finna stop for shit
Get rich or I die trying, my intent when I ride bitch
Motherfuckers is scheming and plotting, wanna see me fall
Or do to the game, that I’m equipped with and managed to ball
Hating niggaz suck dick, hating bitches suck dick
Fuck every last one of you bitches, and Dougie said this
Living my life for the future, can’t go on stressing the past
All the wild adventures happened, have me Dougie a man
Now I’m standing six feet, sitting 2-15
With a click of guerillas, and a arsenal weaponry
Ready for war on you bitches, Deegie bitches is smashing on all haters
Cut throat nigga, when it’s all about my paper

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
The only thing I know up in my life, is go hard
And facing your contributions, determines your reward
The time that we living, is a recycle of life
The shit that you see in your life, once you might see it twice
So I keep on pursuing my paper, packing this pump
Niggaz is facing and flinching, feeling froggy to jump
Got no time for procrastination, conscience holding me up
The only thing that I see, is dolla-dolla buck-buck
Give it to me bitch what, I’m a G and I’m mashing at all cause
Only thing that I got, is my word and my balls
People that prosecute me, niggaz that want me red
When it comes to my dollas will I mash, bitch bet

[Hook - 4x]

   
   As the last breath triggers the last beat
   I look to the sky to drown the devilish heat
   I feel it closin’, they’re gettin’ higher and higher
   Each foul flame from the same hellfire
   Only moments passed since I existed
   Perhaps I acted rash, I should have done what they insisted
   I resisted, twisted thoughts ran wild
   I was too mad to be mild, I was too rough to be riled
   But now it’s done, I probably won’t be missed by anyone
   Although I had my fun I’m still on the run
   Where am I goin’? It’s no good not knowin’
   Should be glad that I’m gone because my yellow streak’s showin’
   Thinkin’ have I done much wrong for me to perish
   Or will I have another day for me to cherish
   I have to bargain, see my soul’s on the line
   So I’ll settle for nothin’ lesser than the Great Divine
   
   Verse 2
   
   Friends worked hard to try and save me, why? They didn’t know
   If I was them I would’ve left me long ago
   It’s over, thoughts are trained towards the hereafter
   I look for The Saviour but then I hear laughter
   If I’m to make it through the Pearly Gates
   I have to devise a plan and get my story straight
   It ain’t too late to save my soul, I never lost a scheme
   I’ll talk to God and make him melt like an ice cream
   It seems this waiting is for reflection
   Then when it’s done I’ll go whatever direction I deserve
   But listen, I’ll deserve my place there
   Ok, I’m scared, but I don’t easily scare
   I’ll walk up, knock on the door like I’m the gentry
   Plead from my knee and they’ll proceed to give me entry
   I reflect on all the stealin’, the dealin’, the dissin’
   Hopin’ somewhere up in heaven that my file went missin’
   
   Verse 3
   
   I used to be a big man, like kings respected
   I carried out the sort of things expected of me
   And my posse, bred to be bossy
   Didn’t yield to command you felt the back of my hand, understand?
   I did dope, sold to kids who were thrilled by it
   I was responsible for many who were killed by it
   I didn’t realise then, but now I know
   I didn’t realise then, but even so
   I stole to deprive, scold those who patronised
   Fought for my turf, it was worth it in my eyes
   Cheated, repeated all this day by day
   Until the medic picked me up from where I lay
   Bleeding, but not conceding to the battle
   The darkness teased an unease, light bleeds staccato
   That’s when I knew I had to try it
   Prepare a prayer and pray he’d buy it
   Convince him, rinse him of my dirty past
   Rotten or right I must fight to the last
   Before the hands that pulled me down held tight
   I will repent before the love of life
   Fear cries, I’m drowned and bound to miss
   Valhalla, my seat in celestial bliss
   Infernal heat just like a creature creepin’
   Eternal sleep will be a lonely sleepin’
   
   Verse 4
   
   Father friend me, defend me
   Lend me your faith so that my fate don’t send me
   Down to the gates of Hell
   I did enough time inside a prison cell
   So take me, don’t forsake me
   Shape me from here so that my fear don’t break me
   Keep me from the terror that lies
   Beneath your kingdom, beneath the skies...
   
   Did he buy that? Well did he hear my prayer?
   I gave praise, I’m amazed he’s still up there
   He’s probably sendin’ down a heavenly host
   He’s just too busy to be leavin’ his post
   So I wait for a while but the Devil’s still posin’
   I wave goodbye while the gates are closin’ behind me
   You’ll never bind me or enslave me
   Hurry up heaven, come down and save me.

Aceyalone:
Hello world...

Wake up, another beautiful day
time to pack my bags and be on my way
it’ll be a long trip and a wonderful stay
the missions have been assigned and stamped with an ‘A’
I contact Abstract, and we check the tactics
to exit the projects and combat this wackness
we discuss the details, ? all our duties
and plus this retail, this is a real life movie
so where we playin’ at? where we stayin’ at?
I heard they sayin’ that they more than ready
because we rock on and on and we rock steady
he’s a scorpion on the scene with the deadliest stings
and I’m the lone marine, marine, biologist machine
who called for the A-Team?
he’s a scorpion on the scene with the deadliest stings
and I’m the lone marine, marine, biologist machine
who called for the A-Team?

Abstract Rude (spoken):
Ten years ago a rap commando unit was sent to prison 
for a covert experimental rhyme project deemed 
ahead of it’s time and insightful of public hysteria.  
Thus, a threat to commercial defense.  These men promptly 
escaped from maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles 
underground.  Today, still wanted by corporations, 
they survive as soldiers of fortune and artistic integrity. 
If you have a problem that no one else can help, 
an MC no one else can serve, a show you really want 
to be rocked, and if you can find them, 
maybe you can hire The A-Team

Abstract Rude:
Acey, The Faceman, I’m A.B. Baracus
who frame the A-Team, like Roger Rabbit?
from L.A. under(?) to the land down under
U-S-A to the A-U-S
and as much as my blood rush quick for hip hop shit
trust in your gut, grit teeth when your rhyme’s bit
good grief, hard time, how unfortunate
we still recordin’ it, we still performin’ wit
elite lineups, throwin’ strikes after wind ups
at least let loose a masterpiece that’ll raise the roof
tranquilize, then when I open my eyes
It’s gettin’ kinda scary in the friendly skies
we got invited, we had to come and blow
and sooner than you thought, when all was lost, a double dose
of a ‘Masquerade’, part one and two, ‘Treble and Bass’,
‘Deep & Wide’, ‘Keep It True’
we keep it true, we keep it true
we keep it true, we keep it true
(relax your mind with the music...)
we keep it true

Aceyalone:
The uncanny (uncanny), uncandid\t(uncandid)
untouched (untouched), untampered, un-expanded
we landed from the void
we specialize in the reconstruction of the destroyed
I am armed and my harness is my charm
the record can never be tarnished, once it’s formed
my identity (identity), my entity (entity)
was everything that it was meant to be
see it was sent to me and it was gladly accepted
I-- I tried to give it away, but it was sadly rejected
a persona, of a grown up Acey, a loner
it’s the path of the maker and the owner
it existed, as the whole world resisted (resisted)
they couldn’t hold on for long, before they kissed it
and they blessed it (blessed it), with all sincerity (sincerity)
I say this with pure clarity
who framed the A-Team? they must have been hating
sabotaged, they’re working for the enemies
who framed the A-Team? they must have been hating
sabotaged, but they can’t conquer this energy

and we keep on and keep on and keep on and keep on 
and keep on and keep on and keep on...
(sit back and vibe with this true shit)

Ab Rude:
Abby Rude aka Jimmy Rome(??)
with my Tribe clique i tell it like it is on the microphone
Cali to New York parks
on you’re radio like sports talk
outlining as if white chalk drew us
the truest at Lemiert Park
rhyming ‘til death do us part
and our birthmark must be a mic
since our first start, we did it right
we in the game, whether you know the name, me and my main
now, now ‘ere these sounds so I can knock on your program director’s door
the underground protect, respect, I hit the floor
and I architect for more than commercial buildings
so deep I rip carpet, so high I burst ceilings
I eventually make millions, create children
do sports reporting, retire
then come back like Michael Jordan
title awards and final good-byes
you’re gonna wanna spin it, if the vinyl is mine
A-Team

[Jehad]
J to the E to the...
J to the E to the..[Coughs]...let me clear my throat man..relax relax
Hey Timur man put the speakers closer to the people, bring it all
closer, gather round,
Ok, here we go...check it out, check  it out...

[Jehad]
J to the E to the H A D
It’s only my name not war on your country
Get your facts right before you start spreading
Jihad is a struggle in the direction I’m heading
I ain’t no sheik I ain’t here to preach,
I’m far from perfect I ain’t trying to teach,
Just give me a chance, let me say what’s in my head
Don’t bring me down just because of what I said

[Ahmed]
They say freedom of speech but they’re all corrupt,
When I speak my views they want to shut me up
Tell me Mr. President what have you got to hide?
Come out and show the world what you’re really like
Peace, Peace, Peace is what you constantly claim
All the violence in this world you’re to blame
As the poor are getting poor, the rich are getting rich
How many governments will fall into their trick?
Flip the script on the way to Baghdad like a GI-JO
Bed time story dead kids for your show

[Chorus - Jehad]
Australia\xc2\x85 Is where we’re born and raised
Islam is our religion and Allah we praise
As Lebanese blood runs through my veins
I’m ripping up the rhymes like a hurricane

[Hesh]
Not perfect myself, got to improve my health
My money and wealth just put them on the shelf
Am I afraid of the west? Follow Sunna to my best
Is this life is a test? A constant quest until I rest
Around the globe my peoples blood is spilling
Georgie claims to be defending but he’s doing all the killing
Plotting, scheming, contemplating on a plan
Trying to destroy what he doesn’t understand

[Jehad]
Throw on your thinking cap and lace up your boots
Were four-psyched brothers and we’re ready to shoot
No missiles, guns or even live ammunition
For the bullets that I use all you got to do is listen
This ain’t a protest or a battle contest
I’m doing my best to get these feelings off my chest
We’re lyrical Muslims, any problems with that?
We’re just doing our thing so get off our back

[Chorus - Hesh]

[Moustafa]
When I talk about my deen what do u remember?
Explosions? Without no Surrender?
Lebanese Gang Rapes up in Lakemba?
Or New York 11th of September?
The world just hates becausee they’re looking at minorities
There’s bad apples in every Society
Bush administration, and the KKK
Zionists, Hitler and People slanging yay

Listen to our message, hope it comes along clear
What The Brothahood are saying may cause a little fear
If by any chance we did happen to offend
Forgive us for the sake of Allah my friend

[Chorus - Moustafa]

* first single

[Verse One]
Look I’m comin straight out of Slauson, a crazy motherfucker name Nipsey!!!
I’m turfed up cause I grew up in the Sixties!
Caution! To you rap niggas try and diss me!
I go hard that’s why yo’ bitch wanna flip me
Big guns niggas turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips I give a fuck who you ‘posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it’s rap money no advance it’s all royalties
You broke nigga you could follow me
It’s fuck bitches get money keep some hollow tips logically
And I’m from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work it’s a policy
(*Hustle) It’s white chalk on the corners
It’s yellow tape on the gates...........choppers up above
That’s Cuz and turnin Loc’s runs the streets where I’m from

[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Plus money and bitches that’s the way that we do it
First get ‘yo grind on, then get yo’ shine on
We come through daytime with the lights on
Now hit the fast lane, and let yo’ chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah! It’s Hussle in the house
Yeah! It’s Hussle in the house

[Verse Two]
Blue rag, S-hat, gold on my neck fat
Guns case catch that, neighborhood, I rep that
Shoot first, ask last, move work, fast cash
{?} hurst, tip dabs, squabble if you get mad
And in my lifetime, I seen a lot of death
A couple cold nights, it look like it was nothin left
But God got me, so I got him tatted on my flesh
Slauson - nigga, you ain’t heard shit yet
Cuzzy, Cobby, Hoodsta Rob, Tiny Draws
Dippin Stone, when he come home - then baby, we dog
And cain’t forget my big brother Black Sanchez
A young nigga wit a million dollar plan

[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches that’s the way that we do it
First get ‘yo grind on, then get yo’ shine on
We come through daytime with the lights on
Now hit the fast lane, and let yo’ chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah! It’s Hussle in the house
Yeah! It’s Hussle in the house

[Verse Three]
I came from nothin - so did every other rapper
Save the spectulation, real banger, gun clapper
SILENCE! - Henny, I’ll posses you with the Mac
I’ll turn him into candle on the curb over blood splat
Fuck Rest in Peace shirts, nigga where ya guns at?
Hittin been two weeks and we ain’t seen no get back
Type of shit is that, yo Crippin is wack
You ain’t poppin you ain’t turfed up, nigga - you off deck

Ready to hop out, and do my muh’fuckin stuff
SIX-OH, NIGGA, dats wassup - HUH!

[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches that’s the way that we do it
First get ‘yo grind on, then get yo’ shine on
We come through daytime with the lights on
Now hit the fast lane, and let yo’ chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah! It’s Hussle in the house

[Intro]
[Shady Jeff] Lets go right now!

[J-dog]
I look alive, I’m dead inside
My heart has holes and black blood flows
We’ll do some drugs, well fall in love and get fucked up while the world just shrugs
With no thought Logically
Were wondering the streets so aimlessly
I hate to see these kids just being put down so painlessly
And people say you Dye your hair and wear tight jeans, that doesn’t mean
That you can’t scream, or like loud noise, you got a choice, you have a voice
And just because you showed no love and hate on us
you fucked our trust
Now watch we thrust this
Knife Called Lust into my Chest until it Bust

[Chorus]
[Producer]
This love, This Hate
Is burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s hard to face that we’re all the same
This love, This Hate
Is Burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s harder times like these that never change
([Shady Jeff] That never change)

[Charlie Scene]
mad at the fact your dad is an addict, your friend takes pills he thinks it cures sadness,
I’m not here to attack or make you kids panic,
but i just think it’s tragic the way these kids have it
and everybody sins and it all begins, it goes back around, nobody ever wins
and you stab yourself in the back, EVERYBODY JUST RELAX! it all just hits so close to home,
we all got friends but we stand alone, and your on your own from a broken home,
you keep the truth inside and it stays unknown Nostalgia hit and its time to quit,
and everybody acts like it don’t mean shit a
and your friend will stab you just to fuck some girl,
put your hands in the air and scream FUCK THE WORLD!!!

[Chorus]
[Producer]
This love, This Hate
Is burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s hard to face that we’re all the same
This love, This Hate
Is Burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s harder times like these that never change
([Shady Jeff] That never change)

[Bridge]
[Producer and Charlie Scene] Let go
[Producer] I’ll bring you closer
[Producer and Charlie Scene] Right now
[Charlie Scene] I’ll hold on tightly
[Producer and Charlie Scene] Let go
[Producer] We’re going no where
[Producer and Charlie Scene] Somewhere
[Charlie Scene] And things aren’t over
[Producer] Harder times like these!
[Producer and Kurlzz and Shady Jeff] Growing up on the streets!
[Producer] Harder times like these!
[Producer, Kurlzz and Shady Jeff] We’ll put you back on your feet!

[Chorus]
[Producer]
This love, This Hate
Is burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s hard to face that we’re all the same
This love, This Hate
Is Burning me away
([Shady Jeff] is burning me away)
It’s harder times like these that never change
([Shady Jeff] That never change)

[Ending]

And I fall to the ground with my teardrops
And I get lost every time my heart stops

{Girl Singing Chorus 2X}
Estoy tan enamorada de los hombres chicanos
Que cuando se estan peliando triste me pongo
Estoy tan enamorada de los hombres chicanos
Que cuando se estan peliando triste me pongo

{Shisty}
Malcreado y mal educado
Nino simberguenza saz aste un lado
Haces un pecado y dices que te vale
Eres el culpable, dale mijo dale
No pierdas el jale
Metelo en el clavo
Porque si lo pierdes mueres acostado
Con dos en la frente
Plomo pa la mente
Suenos de balazos
Suenos inocentes
Suenis de tortillas, chile, y quesadillas
As que te llegan nuevas pesadillas
Dos en las rodillas pa que no te pares
Raza en tijuana y en cuidad juarez
Pasa en tu barrio pasa en tu casa
Pollo sin cabeza como calabaza
Si no siges reglas no tienes sentido
O estas en mi equipo o eres enemigo

{Chorus 2X}
Estoy tan enamorada de los hombres chicanos
Que cuando se estan peliando triste me pongo
Estoy tan enamorada de los hombres chicanos
Que cuando se estan peliando triste me pongo

{Mr. Lil One}
Pesadillas en la mente que yo siento
En las casa todo solo como menzo
Pesadillas en la mente que yo siento
Deja te esplico a ti mis sentimientos
Esperate fulano onde vaz
Mira mis manos estoy tirando paz
Pero jamas caminaras sobre mis pasos
Soy el uno el pequeno y te vallas
En mis palabras se tocan en la playas
A mis tocallos y a mis tocallas
Les prometo que en esta vida no les fallo

{Chorus 2X}

{Shisty}
Mirame en la cara
No me digas nada
Voy a rescatar a tu novia enfadada
Puras mamonadas palabras ensimadas
Bajo en trompetas y garras y espadas
(Dile Compadre)

{Mr. Lil One}
Te dedico mi programa oyeme
Abandonado tragos amargos
Consumando solo con el vino
Soy tu padre soy tu tio soy tu nino
Con la historia que cuentan en las noches
Robo de los ricos y vivo con los pobres
Sobres.
Que quieres plieto
Embidioso
Te agaro a cacos
Pa la dotrina me vale lo que opinas
Tu vestido te comportas como nina
En la cantina en las noches y en mis dias
Tambien mi sangre te doy tus pesadillas

{Chorus 2X}

[Intro: Blaqtoven singing]

[40 Glocc]
I done been through hell and back, been around with a mini mac
Better watch your back, exactly ??? set off lil traps
What about the snaps? We gotta get em and get em fast
Don’t forget to stack your cash, put a mask on and mash
Where the guns at, nigga? Stay held and cock and blast
Better get up off your ass and put a g up in that stash
At last we on top, leavin em in a state of shock
Better kick rocks and get got, fuck around and get shot
Always plottin uo the schemes, weigh weight on triple beams
Gotta get the cream, take the cheese with ryders on my team
I’m like a fiend, but I’m way too sick
I’m makin a living off the dream, nigga get off my dick
I’m so sick, and I’m fuckin with nuthin but killas
Gotta get the skrilla, yo I’m livin the life of a ???
I’m a hustler, throw the ball, and if the game ain’t tall
I keep my back against the wall cuz I know I could fall

[Chorus X: Blaqtoven]
I said you better be careful what you do in life
Cuz niggas out there, they’ll take your life
Makin money, don’t stop, it’s do or die
In Killa California

[Jayo Felony]
Ya’ll niggas is half ass c’s, tossin my shit
And hit a nigga up sick, like nigga, this crip
I pop slugs like collars and always make hos holla
Kill a nigga in his church clothes for this almighty dolla
Nigga I’m Big Bullet Loco, we givin out orders now
Neighborhood crippin, we ain’t fuckin with niggas thats watered down
Cuz he ass deep, thats mean, lets see if he can compeat with the spit
Nigga it’s hoodlum for life, and I’m livin this shit
I got a fo five that I shot five times with the four lives
Disrespect the set cuz, and you payin with yo life
Think we put niggas to sleep, cuz, I sleep with my heat
I never had an enemy livin across the street
Give the last nigga a cocktail that his ass can’t drink
And leave him full of joles in a hole till his body starts to sink
I’ma stomp muthafuckas with one strap and a stocking cap
Crippin all across the water, put my city on the map
Niggas is phonies

[Chorus X2]

[Ill Knob]
I’m telling you right now I’m only fuckin with my niggas from the hood
We up to no good, have you bustin shots and rockin blocks from out the
cockpit of the Audi
Arabian like Saudi, scud missle shower, and I will never cower
Have you crying on your knees, beggin for Christ to save you
Cuz your inside leakin out from all the holes that niggas gave you
It’s the K to the G, Klick Ga Blow, Coney Isle nigga
Style, yeah, it’s funny how my niggas get money now

[K9]
Life’s frustration, my mind view point elimination
Representation, the seeds of violence when it comes to the situation
Irradication on individuals, sent you to violent rituals
We could physical on the mic, close, watch ???
It gets critical when I gets lyrical
Five storms underground, arm you ???, should be taking pounds
We don’t allow ??? to sleep, no ???
Those who play hardcore get slain, put in the grave while the burner rage

[Chorus X4]

[Chorus 2X: Imogen Heap "Speeding Cars" sample]
"There there baby, it’s just textbook stuff
 It’s in the ABC of growing up"

[XV]
Yeah, three women raised me, Famous Footwear paid me
Not enough to blow up, but showed up cause I ain’t fucking lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy, or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z, I slumped
in my chair and my grades, my hair wasn’t waves
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way
The Dead Society of a Poet, homie I’m focussed
But that’s something that a dude can’t prove
I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was Cripping
Just me and two of my dudes, blue man crew
Had dreams of doing things they say that you can’t do
cause everything ain’t black and white ‘less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while my mom asking why I’m truant at school, she said

[Chorus 2X]

[XV]
Yeah, uh, so why ain’t I go college?
My momma’s ultimatum made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said, V’s bugging
Stay on your computer software debugging, but we holding hardware cause we thugging
Now they in the trap house with some guns that they done borrowed
and all this snow/Aldis Snow, I call it "Infant Sorrow"
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood like, fuck it, don’t need the cargo
They banking I don’t do "Well", and I don’t mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Tryna keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
cause they a mind that’s idle is a Devil’s toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him sit down, this information is vital, look

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Living my life like I’m living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song, and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don’t violate my patience, I’m waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal/steel like a metal piece
I’m screaming out, fuck the police, I’m dealing my cards with jokers on ‘em
You can disown him or stone him, I’m throwing them rocks back
with the fury of bullets, you couldn’t live your life for the moment
when I’m foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
I’m in the back of a black Buick, finna black out
like February, ain’t that’s how blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I’m screaming for help as loud as I can, but that’s not working
I’m working them corners like blueprints, then caught an L on my first offence
The judge threw the book at me, then said this

[Chorus 2X]

This is your captain once again. As we make our descent
into Los Angeles we hope you had a pleasant flight.
The weather conditions are clear blue skies at 126 degrees
and we’ll be in the terminal in less than 30 seconds.
Once again thank you for flying Death Row West.

Kali baby!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Gave me gave me, you not offer baby, shame on you
Now I’m naming you with gangs of babes I gave it to
Now it’s front of you, I know you know I want it too
We stay cuckoo cause I get around

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don’t hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn’t do it to you
(It’s alright)
If you wanna act like a hoe
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh
(That I get around)
Way-oh, way-oooh

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don’t hold me down, down, down)

Sme shoe, what they want from you?
Cause I get around like doughnut, don’t I?
Boner, bigga boota (yeah!)

You gave it up cause you was not at my show

Talking with fans, they like Kali sound
But don’t falling of with me, baby!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I’m an amazing
Living a making
And no vickie completely I’m taken
Into the muttin but I’m leaving her something
Got her something, but I’m leaving you money
For the wanton
Many moves I get it
Any poon I wet it quit
Can’t let it sit, I ain’t got no etiquette
Women are fetishists, eat em up like lettice
And feder, chedder and then my vendetta

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don’t hold me down, down, down)

Way-oh, way-oooh

Ha! (One two three four!)

[Murs]
She’s always goin through my phone and tryin to smell my clothes
She’s always askin me for money like I’m sellin Os’
I’m super faithful but there’s nothin I can tell this hoe
I - CAN’T - STAND - THIS - BITCH

She’s always tellin me how much she fuckin hates her friends
They fight, they make up, they fight, and now they friends again
She cries, she laughs and then she cries, it’s like it never ends
I - CAN’T - STAND - THIS - BITCH

She’s anti-social, emotional cause she hates her father
I tried to treat the psychosis but that just makes it harder
Sometimes she acts like my wife, sometimes she’s like my daughter
And everytime I raise my voice, she say she pressin charges
Taking all this punishment, I’m like a motherfuckin martyr

We been together, steady forever since Grade 6
Love notes, Lemonheads and them Chick-O-Sticks
It was puppy love, now all we got is dog shit
I - CAN’T - STAND - THIS - BITCH

So then I got a white girl (Got a white girl, gotta get a white girl)
And I never really dated outside my race before (Got a white girl, gotta get a white girl)
But.. I figure fuck it, why not? (Got a white girl, gotta get a white girl)
You know my momma always said, if she can’t use my comb, don’t bring her home
But now that I’m livin on my own, I’m like fuck it!
(Gotta get a white guuuuuurrrrrrrrllaaaahhhh~!)

Pretty blond girl from the upper Westside
Met her at a block party out in Bed-Stuy
Could tell from her earrings and her red eyes
That this white chick really like the dread guys
So I moved in, it was a easy win
And then I moved in, life was easy then
I could come, I could go as I pleased
A doorman with my own set of keys
But she never could really relate to me
Ever word she said about my race seem like hate to me
Guilty white liberall bullshit, empty empathy
Despite all the pimp in me, I had to leave eventually
Yep.. even though the rent was free
She was into self-hate, she wasn’t really into me
What she wanted as a White Mandingo
Big black dick with mindset of a gringo

(You can say the N-word but I CAN’T! How is that okay?)
Mindset of a gringo..

(Kinda feels like a Brillo pad..)

(My best friend was black.. I mean, he’s still black.. 
 I’m not really friends with him though)

(Hey~! Do you know a Tyrone Jenkins?? He just requested me
 ...I don’t know, he’s black!)

(Intro)
It’s now time for our featured presentation
Jersey’s finest, it’s gon’ down
Back in effect, alright, ok, check it out

[Viro the Virus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Stampedin’ like a psycho rhino
It’s the wino named Viro and I know
You can’t see my flow through either of your eye holes
Try and get played like Tyco
I snipe foes nocturnal wit night glow
Then ride out back to the hide out to light dro
Too much to deal wit
Wit ill shit steal ya meal ticket real quick then flip the kill switch
I’m bio-hazard rhymin’ bastard
Rap the mic in lightning flashes
The rappers turn piles of ashes
Multisyllabic wit court like status
Cold Colt-45 and a ho tight in my attic
Pour some out on the floor for Rick James
Think of Dirt McGirt and do the same thang again 
From the womb to the tomb my momentum gains
And music most fluid like it’s dope in ya veins

(Chorus)
V shop cars like top dog
An advocate to sex, drugs and hip-hop off the wall
Sick, dope, dope, sick
Yeah, to all of you and y’all and all of ‘em
Listen, V shop cars like top dog
An advocate to sex, drugs and hip-hop off the wall
Sick, dope, dope, sick
Yeah, listen that full attention, you don’t wanna miss ‘em

[Viro the Virus]
Yo you can never play me like a jheri curl
Even when I’m about to hurl off a St. Pauli Girl
With no money for bubbly
I still get bars deep in barkeeps from Coyote Ugly
Got a PHD in Advance Flow Studies
To keep it bouncin’ like Man Show juggies
Tighter then bosom buddies 
Good, Bad, and Hungry
And got mad hoodrats that love me (Why?)
Cuz I’m fluid and I’m well hung
Do it till it’s well done
To leave losers wit their bells rung
Bring the beef like meatloaf
Every emcee’s nightmare
The fans say he’s such a dream boat
From a cloud of weed smoke I emerge
With obscene quotes and rhymes wit fightin’ words
Out for glory and whores wit nice curves
And I can end your story at the tip of the iceberg

(Chorus)

[Viro the Virus]
I’m either too trash to dance lickin’ acid stamps
In a classic max stance wit a trashy tramp
(Or) Inhalin’ spliffs in Motel 6
With underage runaways takin’ black tale flicks
(Or) Drinkin’ gin wit a harlot
Steppin’ on peasants pestering me to touch the hymn wit my garment
(Or) In the stoop takin’ bong hits
Morphing my morbid poetry to songs to put ‘em on disc
Either way I’m not the kid to play
My display peals your mascara then leaves your mascaraed in disarray 
Hung wit fellas who had the map for Zelda
Now I hang wit cats wit blunt wraps and paraphernalia
Full time failures, plottin’ on part time bank tellers
To get dough for a crib wit a wine seller
Boy, I tell you they don’t write ‘em like they use to
So I hit the stew and cook this up like couscous

(Chorus)

[Verse 1]
How you think things is gonna ever change?
If you keep doing the same old things
You ask the Lord for help
But you won’t help yourself
Now you sitting there with your worries and cares
Talkin about God won’t answer your prayers
You got that feeling He let you down
You tried to swim and he let you drown
But that’s not ever the case, you looked the solution dead in the face
Did a u-turn and headed your way, and now you say that religion is fake
But if you search your mind, I guarantee you’ll find
When you was in a bind, the Lord was there like every time
But you ignored the signs wanting sombody to blame
But let’s be real you got free will
and God ain’t gone come out the sky and make you change
But when you make the same mistakes over and over
And you get older and older, when the game over its over
You can’t say nobody told ya, when you sleep in the grave
and I hope you heed the words that I say, heed the words that I say

[Verse 2]
How long you think you gone really roll?
How long before they kick down your door?
Throw you and your kids on the floor
Tearing up your crib and they lookin for dope
Found one brick and they lookin for more
and now your goose is cookin for sure
How many times you done heard it said?
that you gone wind up in jail or dead?
Not you ‘cause you just too smart
got alot of brains and too much heart
Besides you not in the game for life
you can stop just as soon as you start right?
But one year turns to 2, and 2 years turn to 4, and 4 years turn to 8
Now you can’ stop its just too late
Now you await your fate, wondering how its gone came
Is it gonna be your local PD, theDEA or a young assassin’s gun?
Now you ain’t havin fun, stuck up in your house and
lookin out the window with a pistol like Malcolm
Thinking somebodys coming to get your thousands
But if I was in your shoes
I’d drop to my knees and pray
and ask the Lord to show me another way, man heed the words that I say

You are my church, you are my place of worship
I heard you’re the plug, can I be the circuit?
When I got court, I hope that you’re the verdict
When you’re around, my insides turn inverted
My blood start to rush when I see you, darling
I know you’re nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you, you’re heavens incarnate
What is this spell baby, please show some mercy

[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream
When you smile
Melting, you’re a daydream
Stay a while

I pray that I can learn to be funny
I am watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you will smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites
I wanna touch them with the dead of night
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight
Then somehow I know everything’s alright

[Chorus x2]

[J-Diggs]
I gots this saucy lil’ tender
Baby bad to the bone
Disrespect lil’ mama best to know it be on
I go hard for baby girl
I can’t help but to dig her
A lil’ jealous cause I know she got more than one nigga
The way I figure its cool if you’re treatin’ her right
You best be suckin’ her, fuckin’ her, and eatin’ her right
You want the truth
I done bust shots for baby before
For niggaz neglectin’ and disrespectin’ my ho
"Hell no! You lost your mind? Is y’all crazy?"
This is my bitch, I love her, and she havin’ my babies
We been together since the top
When I was jockin’ the corners
Was only 10 when I met my lil’ friend California
Stumbled up one her when I was like ridin’ my bike
Come to find out, Cali gets live at night
She hang wit Bay boys
And bangers called Crips and Bloods
She taught me how to hustle sellin’ dimes and dubs
We made love on the daily
I was payin’ her dues
Cali taught me the game
But Cali changed the rules
Confused, I never knew better
Used to sweat her for cheddar
She seduced me, and used me, from the day that I met her
She had me body guardin’
And I’m jump-startin’, and I’m drive bying’ and dischargin’
High speed chasin’, false statements to the sergeant
I was so young and so dumb
The time, had no funds
But fuckin’ wit young Cali
I got more dope and more guns
Put me on her turf and made me hustle for her trap money
Whispered in my ear "If you do good I’ll give you rap money"
Sat me down one night so she can whip me wit some game
Gave me pen and pad, equipped me wit some slang
Told me that I’d write about the life that she had laid out
Keep her name alive
And make sure she never played out
Represent that place where we met on that Cali corner
Let the world know I got a thang for Mrs. California

[Von Pea - Verse 1ne]
We was on some dinner and a movie
The state, place, and court street
The movie startin at 12, so let’s time to eat
Barely talked while we ate, both kinda shy
But you was 10, out and in, so I gotta try
Small talk, like I’m runnin for president
Makin her laugh and such, back to an uncomfortable hush
Paid the bill and then jet
11:50, I said, "Jet" - heh-heh
Hit the movies a lil’ late, but she the main feature
Get to the seats, asked me to get her some sweets
Eww, Jujubes, hopefully they taste better
offer petite - hold up, Nic..
Yo, left arm around her neck, the scent so sweet
like Nicolay on beats, smile dimples and cheeks
Still kinda awkward, but the tension is there
The way she touched my leg, the way I play with her hair
Black chicks lettin you touch her weave is rare
Spilt in her black jean skirt, I tried not to stare
Half-button her red purse, shirt to match
And her hand in the popcorn, the tub is in my lap
Ooh!

[Chorus 2X]
Ain’t nuttin changed in the game, it don’t change
Cover your eyes, he’s got a surprise, shorty
Cover your eyes, she’s got a surprise, brother

[Von Pea - Verse 2wo]
Shaped like a Colt .55, honey had a +Major Figga+ like Ab-Liva
Got her hair dyed up, black with red stripes
a Prada bag buyer; you would think conceit, but she actually sweet
Liek when I first met her, she was happy to meet
Shook my hand and now our eyes started to dance
I sized her up, and it upped my size
I mean, looka t her eyes and look at her thighs
How could I deny intimidation?
She know December wasn’t hatin, she was cooler than refrigeration
Kept talkin on the street until I mention datin
I took her number like communion, hopin to make a union
Continued to speak and then back to hear
Kinda tipsy, I’ll give up my rap carrer
for this pretty young thing at eighteen
One of her face seem to bring, I’m wait-in
Sippin the drink at dinner, the flick is over
We add litter to the floor with candy, she want some more
Last visit to the snack bar, then to a cab, pah
It’s two in the morn, plus in the cab, I’m mad hard
"Von, it’s too late for me to go to the house
My moms don’t play around, by now I’m locked out
Maybe I should call my girl" In other words
She comin over to rock my world
I got this girl!

[Chorus 2X]

[Von Pea - Verse 3hree]
Bring that pretty ass to my crib (oooooh!!)
SO we could sit down and talk for hours
Scratch that, get down and fork for hours
Snatch that, surround my cork for hours
Naw, I’m buggin, thirty-five minutes later, she nuttin
We get hungry after the session, she over the oven
Makin hot dogs, she drank ALL the lemonade
Ate ALL the chips, ALL the minute Maid
She has to go, but we stayin in touch
Next week, next date, we ain’t sayin as much
or playin as much, it’s more like, "You ready to go now?"
I’m givin her the look like, "You ready to bone now, or what?"
We take it to her crib, and take it to her ribs
and now I’mw alkin ‘round the crib
Family flicks and graduation, a brown living room set
A beige carpet and a PlayStation
Couple of books and more pictures
Opened up her baby album and snickered, coulda cried a river
‘Cuase of one picture, she was no older than three
Standin wit a little boy that look just like me
Same head, same face, matter fact that is me
Recalled ‘87 when I had that ten-speed
Asked her about it, and as far as she remembers
It was taken by her moms, a reunion in Virginia
Speak of the devil, her mother enters
OH DAMN, it’s Aunt Linda! 

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Now clap yo’ hands, I know you want to (one, two)
Now sing along, I know you want to (one, two)
Now stomp yo’ feet, I know you (one, two)
Just feel the vibe, I know you (one, two)
La-LAH-la-lah, I know you want to (one, two)
Zah-ZINGA-zing, I know you want to (one, two)
Zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom, I know you want to (one, two)
And we do it like this, I know you want to (one, two)

[Chorus One]
Summertime, round the bend
Winter’s rain, comin in
D.C. City, listen here
Music sounds, out so clear
For you...

[Lord Quas]
Just like season change I bring rainfall {get your umbrella}
Or sunshine, when it’s summertime y’all (hey look at that bikini)
Or cold shoulders when it’s wintertime all
Colors when it’s spring I seem to stand tall

Different time, different day, different way (why do somethin else?)
The original way, with supplemental grays, instant plays {hey rewind that shit!}
"Good Vibes" like we on some Roy Ayers (yo you wanna barbecue?)
"Lady Luck" like we the Ohio Players

You got it just wake up!

[Chorus Two]
We must be, a family
D.C.U. in harmony
Music’s message loud and clear
Peace of mind oh so near
For you...

[Lord Quas]
Mathematically thuggin it down, scientists of sound
Like chord changes switchin around we got the illest sound
Top choice, low rate, no gate, high voice
It’s like we dipped the beat in water and now we up on moist

[Madlib]
Ain’t got no time for haters, only loved ones {whassup man?}
But don’t think we up on sweet, you catch a mental shove
Speakin this language of music (bringin harmony)
You lookin at me dirty, thinkin of ways of harmin me
(But anyway!)

[Chorus One]

[Outro set to Neil Diamond "The Pot Smoker’s Song"]
La, la, lah...
High, high, I wanna get high!
Never give it up if you give it a tryyy
"People turn to artificial highs
 when they really want natural highs"
You with your grass, mom and dad with her booze
"Alcohol and drugs become crutches for people
 who can’t achieve closeness, with others"
{I was, so unhappy like I felt so unworthy y’know}
{At that time I was having problems with, my family}
{I was looking for love somewhere, I wasn’t getting it anywhere}
{I tried to commit suicide}
"Wait a minute, stop!"

I’m at the taco stop, I’m at my mommas shop
I’m at the place where I go and get my tummy topped
A Dope mood, when I drop a line to cop some food
My momma’s got the plug, so you know I’m just chill & eating good
From age six all the way to early twenty something’s
Something crazy would show its head outside my mommas function
crack heads will beg five bucks, get head
Od’s, stab and deaths, Gang signs, slugs, and shit
Well, good thing I ate a lot
My chubby ass couldn’t run outside the parking lot
I couldn’t kick it with the kids who seemed to run the block
As years past half of em were either caged or shot
Theo lacy visits, in and out the system, not the way I want my livin
I just stayed inside and got myself
some fuckin chicken taquitos, and burritos, some birrea
A torta, with some horchata and jarritos

What’s up Juvey?
You remember me?

So a nigga know off top, that I ain’t about that bullshit,

Drop it like it’s hot, drop, drop it like it’s hot
Watch this pussy pop when I drop it like it’s hot
What???!

I’m wiser today, still trying to find me a way
I love rap but it don’t provide retirement pay
That’s no benefits, it’s so interesting
That’s why I scribe it this way
Speech lacking, P came with deep rapping
I work 10 to 6 messing with the my sleep pattern
No time to rhyme/ I sleep wake up
Then I’m back on the grind, body aching
I wish rap was my occupation
I would add 40 hours plus vacation
That’s only a dream, I’m open to things
I have to work hard daily to own a few things
Like a couch or a fridge, bank account full of link
I struggle day to day, with no house or no kids
No wife, no picket fence, no ice
Spending weekends inside, with no life

[chorus]

I grind you grind
man yo I’m trying to make cash
I wonder will it last
I grind you grind
it’s like I’m down on my last cent
And I gotta pay rent
I grind you grind
man yo I’m trying to go to sleep
Within this 40 hour work week
I grind you grind
sometimes I wanna call it quits
Probably call in sick

I can’t call in sick, I gotta ball for chips
I gotta work, I don’t care about the cars or chicks
The fame, the cash, I won’t be Damon Dash
I’ll be Praverb, so I’ll let the labels pass
Not worried about getting signed, I’ll just be wasting time
Forget a record deal I’m back on the grind
I write every now and then
A personal track, or punchlines clowning friends (think about it)

[Trinidad]

Think about the bills pile up, outta luck
Just a drone in this world with no time to add it up
We fall apart like Attica, domino effect
I just want to sit back and cash a check
Much respect to the underground movement
We useless, I’m changing up syllabi’s and students
Keep your head held high and we gone climb
Billboards number one in due time
I’m just preaching to the congregation, stop the hating
We changing up society with Satan
The last temptation, fall victim to generation x
Infatuated sex
Got dukes throwing up a set, that don’t rep
But they paid dues everytime they marked for death
One step for mankind
A step back cause we all know we running out of time

[chorus]

This is the night of my life
Yeah it’s on right now
This is the night of my life
I’m gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

Yeah, we went fast, out a pocket full of cash
So you know where I am going, you don’t even got to ask
Call up the homies, tell them we’re heading out tonight
Call up some shorties, tell them who’s going down tonight
And we gon’ party like there ain’t no tomorrow
I’m about the bottles, I can do all that cause money ain’t a problem
I been to London to France, Australia to Japan
Headed up to Rio, to Puerto Rico
But never like this I’m just saying

This is the night of my life
Yeah it’s on right now
This is the night of my life
I’m gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

You know the club jam packed, it’s where everybody at
Got a couple shots, I’ma take em back
Then a couple more right after that
The way I’m feeling, I hope it never ends
Girl I’m just saying
Your friends and my friends should all be friends
And we could party like it ain’t no tomorrow
Get money’s the motto
So I’m balling just like I just hit the lotto
Whip from from Ibiza To Spain, ATL MIA, New York, Los Angeles
But I never went HAM like this, I’m just saying

This is the night of my life
Yeah it’s on right now
This is the night of my life
I’m gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

This is the night of my life
It is on right now
This is the night of my life
I’m gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

[Illogic]
Haven’t had my license in a few years
so right now it’s illegal to drive myself insane
But laws were made to be broken, so I ride dirty
Four-trackin, rockin a straightjacket
Consciously high wire walkin
No net to catch me if I’m fallin - it’s only dreams
In times I realized, I of sound mind
found sound slaves who bathed in the soundwaves of my bloodstream
Cyclops watches from mountaintops
Those that topple from pedestal praisers
Show me a humble man, and I’ll show you a hero
Show me the prideful and I’ll show you an unmarked graved
I blindfolded Justice with the hands of time
to spare her eyes from her children’s corruption
Patched my wings with duct tape and hope to catch a bird’s eye view
of the construction of our destruction
To demonstrate we excavate at Atlantis depth
Questioning questions don’t lead to where the answer’s kept
The wicked live where faith and doubt intersect
so if it’s a last breath, they’ll bleed it ‘til no pasion’s left
Listen~! Only those who have mastered the framing of masterpieces
can bask in the master’s peace
So recognize the genius in others in order for real genius
to be recognized for the heights it’ll reach like {*music plays*}

well holy mackeral yapple dapple snap crackle

In those jeans, take those off, now watch you spread

While I please his bitch, while I cock the 5th
And I take her ass out, go to Saks and Fifth
And I hit my lil nigga, so I get it for the low
And my youngest lil nigga, gettin’ back up in the hole
Back to gettin’ money and bein’ an asshole
Thinkin’ silly motherfuckas’ ain’t goin’ pay me for my dough
Mane fuck that shit
Rush that nigga, while I rush that bitch too
I don’t give a fuck about you
But I do what I see and I do wanna feel what that mouth do

And I might go and just taze me a nigga
Okay my nigga? So pay me nigga
Fucker
Alright na na na na
Ah na na na na na

* this is a remake of "It Takes Two" by Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock

[unknown speaker]
Right about now, you are about to witness this
The sounds of Lil’ Romeo, the New No Limit, and Presidential campaign

[Lil’ Romeo] 2 Way me

"Hit it!"

[Chorus]
(Romeo, Romeo!) "It takes two to make a thing go right"
(Romeo, oh Romeo!) "It takes two to make it out of sight"
(Romeo, Romeo!) "It takes two to make a thing go right"
(Romeo, oh Romeo!) "It takes two to make it out of sight"

[Lil’ Romeo]
I wanna rock right now
I’m Lil’ Rome and I came to get down
I’m not internationally known
but I’m known to rock the microphone
Call me a pretty boy, crown me the greatest
The New No Limit, y’all cant fade us
You know I’m a winner, sho’ not a loser
P. Miller clothes is what I choose yea
Ladies love me, girls adore me; I mean
Even the ones that never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, whodi I don’t know; okay, yea

[Chorus]

[Lil’ Romeo]
Game time hair done up, hang time
The tank shine, 2 Way on the waist line
Young hero, dress and neck below zero
I’m the best that came in the game, ask Cleo
Holla back young’n (Ooh ooh!) pop ya colla
Call me Richie Rich, I got a dog named Dollar
Custom paint, 20’s on my ride
But I keep it locked down cause I’m too young to drive
I got bank rolls or pesos
So my love dont cost a thing like J-Lo
I’m a baller ma I dont play wit play-doh
You seen Cribs - so that’s how we roll

[Chorus]

[Master P]
You got a mill’?  Give it to the haters
Y’all get fame, we get paper
Rome be Kobe, I’ll be Shaq
Come back and went double platinum back to back
Grown folks watchin, girls be jockin
Oooohweee! The Tank ain’t stoppin

[Silkk the Shocker]
Come off the bench and win it, that’s just in me
Drop the top, nothin less than a Bentley
Y’all twistin the game, we be burstin back
P, Rome, and Silkk - now how ya luv that?

[Chorus]

[Lil’ Romeo]
Okay - six flags, I got the dolo
We rock platinum Tanks, that be the logo
Y’know ya club’ll bounce to this
I’m 12 years old with 21 karats around the wrist
So, whassup doc?  The party don’t stop
These No Limit boys gon’ to drop it like it’s hot

[Chorus] - [Bridge] overlaps

[Bridge]
Where dem girls at?  Where dem boys at?
Throw ‘em up, put ‘em up, get ‘em up!
Where dem girls at?  Where dem boys at?
Throw ‘em up, put ‘em up, get ‘em up!

[Chorus] - repeat to fade w/ variations and [Bridge] mixed in

[Chorus]
we rock up, we get down, we move left, we so right
we nod heads, we shake hips, we take hiphop music to the height of the night
we rock up, we get down, we move left, we so right
we nod heads, we shake hips, cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do

[Verse 1]
It’s the one and only lonely superstar filling up my stupid car
With some petro looking retro
While I check a burner on the metro, tighten up the Velcro
On my waisteband cause the man likes them up
And tighty fitted with stripes knitted on the arguile socks
That I rocks to fit in
To the corporate life cause it’s important wifey must eat
And she ain’t getting fed off of beats or ill rhymes
I climbs the ladder never been sadder man this ain’t my occupation
So frustration sets in
I’m holding my grin just defending hip-hop
Whether it’s clipped on or slip knot in my tie
Wondering why at work playing a jerk
My network got me going berserk
With shirt tails tucked in I’ve been sucked in
Where every emcee goes through cause that’s what we do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
That’s what we do you ask who are you?
well I be blake knight and I practice hip-hop
I arrive non-stop wearin’ shorts and flip-flops
while emcees put thongs in theirs songs and get the gong
I speak life on the mic til your bones be uprockin’
I got flocks of cool cats that’s knockin’ on my door
wantin’ more beats than I can make assembly line style
takin’ awhile but each with distinctive personality
for every emcee who’s hirin’ me to make hits
or farewell songs for callin’ it quits
its the pits, but I figure if god is usin’ me
why should I run from the call of the yes, yes, y’all
so as we breakdown the uprok sound and get down
billy blanco and me commence to emcee
I’d decide to go platinum but that’d be too drastic
so at the present time i’ll be content with plastic

[Chorus]

Come on, come on, come on
March step, let’s fire
STOP!, STOP!, STOP!, STOP!

Hook:

Knuckle up boi

[Doc Brown]
Never was a G, never wanted to be, I did me from my very first steps
When my mother regretted my first breath
Was taught respect, kalma and drama was worthless
Heard death hung over my shoulder to cerb stress
Rest my head upon my old dears chest
Perplexed cause we couldn’t live forever I step through the perspects
Windows of my father’s car
Places far from far away, basically chasin’ stars
Facin’ hardships, started lacin’ bars, achin’ hearts
Like the song said, came this far and can’t stop now but watch how
Before I became Doc Brown I was a timebomb tickin’ the clock down, tick-tock bloaw
Without knowin’ what you wanna do
You can fall victim to your depression when nothin’ else seem to follow through
It hit like cancer thanks to the pull of the street
Each week another young one gone thought he was gangster
In fact I was surely mistaken
Tradgic waste of life, and the predjusdices sayin’, "of cause, he’s Jamaican"
Waitin’ for danger, ain’t happenin’ any time soon
East mad West, this world just like high noon
My truth blow fruitons just like typhoon
Tear roof off a ya mind, like Busta Rhymes’ tune
I move usin’ the force of avalanches
Speakin’ on behalf of kids who never had the chance

[Chorus: Doc Brown]
It’s time, look myself in my eyes
If I die in the next 24 am I happy with my life
There’s lots to lose, even more to give
But I got to choose how I aught to live
So take time, look yourself in ya eyes
If you die in the next 24 are you happy with your life
There’s lots to lose, even more to give
But you got to choose how you aught to live

[Doc Brown]
They say if you ain’t a cause to die for
Then you ain’t got a reason to live and that’s true but you ain’t Guy Forkes
Pick your cause wisely, guys wanna burn at the state
For prize sake, livin’ life at a high speed
Mikey, gat from the flashest of the high street
Nineteen, rollin’ with olders who love fightin’
Elder dudes say to the younger, "to join my team
You gotta be grimy, you gotta be sheisty"
Usually Mike would be too afraid, but this week
feels low, no self esteem and loves the mischief
Shits deep, blood in a second it takes to blink an eye
Decisions on livin’ can switch an be givin’ prison time
Cap down, pull out a browns, strike a match stick
Mike’s badness is a true right of passage
That handbag bitch don’t fuck about, knock around blood
P-64 hit the floor
But he didn’t look before he went runnin’ across the tarmat
Car crashed, smack and Mikey ain’t comin’ back
That old woman touched his neck, he didn’t budge
Life sentance given him straight without a grudge
Now ask yourself, was he a victim of circumstances?
Or was he guilty of his flirtation and romance with
elements that had more power than him?
If you want a happy endin’ then know how to begin

Chorus x2

[Hook: Doc Brown]
Now tell me what do you believe in
Truth, lyin’ or thievin’
Undercover of evenin’
What is it you got in you? Winner or sinner
Surrender your inner demons

[Ad Kapone] 
People always askin ad rock where her beau been 
I been docked in the cuts wit my pad and my pen 
Creatin gangta flows just because the gangstas know 
Its been a long hard road and I had a way to go 
When I was young I was labled as a basket case 
And every one walked by me got the gas face 
And then I started getin taller and my started gowin 
And people said I looked like a Samoan 
But thats all right cuz it made all the girls stare 
But some wouldn’t talk cuz my hair was longer than theirs 
I got a curl and they tease me bout the drip drip 
But I kept it banging so I didn’t even trip 
People always wanna talk down on the under man 
But I had self respect so I kept the upper hand 
And because all the girls was biting...
That’s what kept kapone always fighting 
Jealous punks will sweat you over spilt milk 
And try to plex and that’s what gets brothers killed 
See I don’t care about another gold on his grip 
That don’t phase me, man I don’t even trip 

[Background chorus] 

I aint tripping no more it really aint worth my time 
so just caution all I kick them back and wrote you all a rhyme 

[Ad Kapone] 
My momma always told me it was gonna be days like this 
Where your name is gonna be on somebody’s list 
But don’t drip off the perk and janx 
And to the ones that was that was really down give em’ thanx 
Lesson 3 no don’t change yours for nobody 
It’s funny what some people would do for money 
As I was growing up I had a lot of stepping stones 
Never lonely had my older brother rey bones 
Back at ravens wood man them was the old days 
Doing assemblies and talent shows in P. A 
I remember coming up with the K.O.D 
The kings of death man we was bout 12 deep 
Doc Luc, Chung, Mac 10, and I.C.D 
Glenny Glen, Brucy B, Spice D, and Me 
Tiny t, and the E all old schoolers 
When it came down to rap man we was the rulers 
Then everybody moved away and i was alone 
then I realized it was up to kapone 
To keep the group alive even by myself G 
Then doc luc came back it came reality 
Me and doc rocked shows and brought the house down 
Then we made them O’s and shopped them around 
No one discovered us but we still rocked on 
We bumped and kept all the crowds pumped 
Like the talent show at Menlo and county park 
I think that’s what lit up my first spark 
We was rocking and the scouts were recruiting 
It was coo till dumb brothers started shooting 
It was drama and it raised up a lot of fuss 
And after all that they blamed it on us 
But the media hype wont keep me down 
I control that my behavior is on the crowd 
I don’t understand why they come with that shit 
I’m only Ad man I don’t even trip

Somewhere between heaven and earth
That is where you will find real freedom
We’ve been waiting for so long For this freedom
When other freedom fighters
Puppet master
Marching soldier
Fought of the rights of the people
You fought for the right to
Abuse people
That is why I call you...

[Chorus]
Puppet master
Marching soldier

I was a little boy
When it happened
But I can still hear
Those killing machines
Roaring like thunder
Roaring like hungry lions

And they don’t only hurt us
Physically
And they don’t only hurt us
Politically
But they hurt us mentally

[Chorus: till fade]

(Deep Throat talking)

The 1st times a front, took you out to lunch 
Spent 50 on your food you didn’t eat that much

Can I swang the wheel, in your red Seville 
I put food on your table you can pay your bills 

Chorus (Jhaime Music & Deep Throat):

Baby I’ll drop half on the bills,

Better leave me alone and get Lil’ Daddy to pay your bills 
Cuz you don’t know nan playa with my skills,

Chorus (Jhaime Music):

If you can’t come through, then you gon’ get the boot! 

(Black 1) 
Can you pay my bills 
Then keep it real with me for show, 
Cuz I’m TYP, Throwed Yung Playa 
So you gotta let me know, cuz I’m so for show, 
have plenty mo’, and they couldn’t keep it true 
So I’m telling you, if you don’t come through 
girl you gon’ get tha boot 
You can call it hard, or call me fraud 
If that’s what you would like 
But if you want it all, from a man that ball, 
girl you gotta come at me right 
Wanna drop ya half on a Bentley or Jag, you trying to get over 
You better hit ya stash and grab ya cash 
Or wish on a four leaf clover 
Don’t do no trickin’ baby, and I think that you should know 
Can’t you tell by how I act when I’m spending my dough 
You say I’m tight, call it what you like 
Bet you won’t spend yo’ dough 
But you on tha under, with Reshawnda, playin’ like you broke 

Chorus (Jhaime Music & Deep Throat): repeat till end 

You triflin (Hoodrat, roachin’ type of sista) 
We TYPs (When a girl like cash we gon’ dismiss ya) 
We ballers (When times get hard we need a woman to help us out) 
Instead of (A girl like you who don’t know what a playas about) 
Can you pay my cell phone bill? 
Put Baggettes in my grill? 
Buy a house on the hill? 
Then maybe we can chill 
If you can’t come through 
Then you gon’ get the boot!


I gots to rock the freakin mic, and yes I gots to rock the show,
but when the stress hits me, yo, it’s like 10 blows to the head,
I’m always being hasseled, there’s no end,
hasseled by my Moms and hasseled by the feds,
pressure rising and I’m feeling really tired,
they look into my future and see ‘nigga for hire’,
stay outta trouble, but I gots to break some rules,
no love to the brothers that were cruel,
but now whenever people act like that, 
they wants to see my flop but I cuts no slack,
My head’s pumpin in and out of my brain,
all the stress is causin mental pain,
however, any type of weather, I can rock the show and sit back and live
forever (and ever),
I try to block everything out of mind,
no peace in my life, well not that I can’t find,
My life is so confusing,
I don’t know who’s doing the playing or doing the using,
I’m getting dissed, even by my principle,
you say you’re not in shit and say your not incapable,
buk-buk-buk, Brown goes down,
another concussion of the hip-hop sound,
I strive in my life to keep my heart pumping,
gots to do my job and keep the crowd jumpin,
dealin with this and that, can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus:

Can I get a yo, Can I get a yo, Can I get a yo?
(Yoooooo!)
Can I get a ho, Can I get a ho, Can I get a ho?
(Hoooooo!)

Verse 2:

Yo, you never left me rest,
yes, you keep me 24 stressed,
criticized by my mom ‘cause my pants sag,
don’t wanna go home, don’t wanna hear the nag,
I gotta go the the studio and release my stress with the funky fresh flow,
and just as I get to the peak of rap singing, ding-a-ling-a-ling, the phone
starts ringing,
and I know what’s gonna happen,
some kind of bad news suds up my rappin’,
I get a record to do, I gotta perform, I go to be rough, but yo, I can only
do so much,
so hey,
hey diddle diddle,
when you start fighting, Frankie’s in the middle,
and now you want to pick sides,
so I don’t go home, don’t answer the phone, so I can hide,
‘cause if I do, I gotta dis one of you,
nobody really understands what I be going through,
forget this shit,
I gotta try to get a grip, or I might just slip, or my lid might flip,
and sometimes I wish I could switch, aggrivate my brain, just like an itch,
walked all over like a doormat,
can I get a break can I get a kit-kat,
or can I get a yo, can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus

Verse 3:

Can’t get no shut eye, always gots the pen to my hand,
wanna close my lid, saying to myself I know now I can like the little engine
that could,
try to explain to my Moms, but she never understood,
the way we gotta do this thing, I head for the microphone and I drop my swing,
used to be slippin, now I got a grip,
90% in math, now I’m that tip,
back to the fact, I’m on the bus, gotta finish my rhyme, on the way to
studio check it about that time,
the pressure just killin my brain cells,
gotta do this and that ringin through my head like a bell,
gotta stay on track, stay on track,
define what’s good, bad, phat and wack,
didn’t succeed when I tried to run away from it all,
I came back then I heard my blue pen call,
I’m still striving to reach my goal,
can I get a yo, can I get a yo

Chorus


Ooh, it’s the LA Zoo
We funk with the flow and let niggas know
That it’s ooh, it’s the LA Zoo
We funk with the flow and let niggas know that it’s...

Verse 1:

It’s the king of the jungle and I can’t be tamed
Take you all the way to the millenium brain
It’s the return of the yearm, Mr Funky Worm
Heat it like a bottomless kettle, let it burn
Blow my flow you cannot handle
I’m bumpin and I’m humpin like a camel on your radio channel
It’s me T-H-R-E-A-T
Live for ‘95 most definitely
In fact, under my styles are low jacked
to stop Petie stole his rhymes from the Zoo tribe jeep
You’re dead wrong, unto what tribe they yeb along
So we can know your name when we send ya back home

Chorus x2

Verse 2:

You made a jam so now the nigga think he Van Damme
You must didn’t know I take off like Pan Am
Wreck ya like a pinto, pop the instrumental
and attention ladies and gentlemen
It’s the bomb, I did it, I lit it, let em hit it
and it’s stronger than the humpty with the chrondo dipped in it
And this is for your midas, just to sink into your fangs
It’s the deadly dope man, pumpin thru ya veins
Raised in the Bow 213 area code
where the criminals dig up your grave lookin for buried gold
The universe’ll soon be mines in due time
You can’t tangle with the one from killer Cali’s triangle
Deep deep deep down under the dungeon lies your doom
I write the dynamite and watch it TICK! BOOM!
Looney in the tunes be groovin in your sleep
cos in the speakers and technique is way to freakish

Chorus x2

Verse 3:

Up above the world so high
like the stars up in the sky
I’m funky with the flow, understand you
Brown babies from Atlanta just love me like candy
I give the mom a lendin, should’ve fed me right
Shot to the let em wait on the Eastside
I keep my eyes on the sparrow, hos, afros and arrows
can’t kick it cos it’s wicked like the pharoah
And a walk with the devil is a level far beyond
From de Babylon come many redrum
So follow as we journey thru the  creepy, sleepy hollow
Take this 40 ounce bottle, see how broke niggas is tomorrow

Chorus to fade

Who do you trust?
Can’t trust your bitch, can’t trust your partner
And you sho’ nuff can’t trust the white man

You trust yourself

[ VERSE 1 ]
I’m strugglin and strivin, hustlin and divin, and duckin from the five-o’s
And from them marks right down the way we call our rivals
Young soldiers ten deep on the grind spot
We got the trumps and dimes hot and here’s where the line stops
And I can’t keep my nine in the bushes, Spice
Cause them jealous niggas and them dopefiends and the fuckin vice
Want a nigga to close shop because I’m tearin a grip
I got they spot shook down, let’s empty the round, down the clip
They try to ride, must thought we leave, nigga, but never that
They send some dopefiends over to kill us, nigga, but never that
Straight punks call the task
They can’t work the helicopters, k9’s and gats on that ass
Niggas hit the fences droppin all they twamps, intentions fail
Tryin to make it to my hooptie, but my homie scooped me
Hittin fences, one of my boys got snagged
We tried to get him loose, but the k9’s came and chewed his ass
My other boy’s on the roof jumpin house to house, he lost a step
And fell to the ground and broke his fuckin neck
They’re killin my crew off, they’re killin my crew off
We gotta split up or these k9’s and helicopers gonna get us
So I bail, never look back, I think I lost him 
Killed his k9 dog, I cut him up and then I tossed him
My other boys said fuck it, they stopped and had a showdown
Before they got took the task counted four down
My other bro was hurt, he hit his knees and threw his hands up
They put two zips of coke in his pockets, then they put him in handcuffs
I was almost through the share and breathin heavy
If I made it when I got behind the wheels I knew they couldn’t fade it
I done told you bout them do’s and can’t’s and that shift kick
I hit them corners and five-o got ditched quick
Them niggas ratted us out, the five-o banged coke and gatted us out
Now I’ma show you fools what bein mad is about

[ CHORUS 1 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can’t give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust

[ VERSE 2 ]
I started with ten niggas, I’m down to the dome
I got no block to call my spot, I got no hood to call my home
I must stay strong and maintain D.T.A.
My real homies are gone, so now that gotta be the way
I started in the streets like a hobo, now I’m mobile
I organize my business, but I still duck the robo
I make mo’ money, breakin ounces down sellin sacks, fuck them savages
Kickin my dough down, lookin for packages
I had to down my Chavelle and come anew
Cause I was hot from the block when I used to run the crew
In Oakland on the East Side you know how we ride
We like to swing and slide, whip them old schools and make them inches tight
So I flip the 50 with deposit tractions
Sitton on chrome, Toni supercharge ?Braxton?
You hear me then you wonder where I am
The Flowmaster dude’s barkin hard with the hitters and them camps
First 50 in the Town with the racing stripes
Smokin it up like them dopefiends basin pipes
Niggas know I got the sack
They got a drop but I don’t, but they know the trigger got my back
I see they mouths droolin, niggas gettin shifty-eyed
They wanna jack me cause they know that my 50 ride
One fool tried to jack me on the late tip
Aimed for this chest but I caught him in the hip
Keep one in the chamber with the meter on my dick
Since the safety’s on the trigger you’se one dead nigga

[ CHORUS 2 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can’t give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they’ll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I got them zippers and them quarters and them eights
My stack is gettin fat, so I’m lockin it up in safes
I got the combination tatooed on my brain
Hear all them busters sayin, "That dude’s rollin caine"
Whenever the niggas are rollin the dank and the stank I’m makin the bank
I set up a shop on the block cause drivin and servin the fools I can’t
I told you in the first verse my first shop got shut down
100 grand strong from the dank, I gives a fuck now
A daily operation, more than 40 grand a week
And if they raise the profit, the Goldy man’ll speak
The rollers give a fuck about the niggas grindin dime sacks
They always slap em up and scare em just to find where I’m at
Shit, there was a time when I was a soldier on the block myself
Now I’m stressin and I’m knowin now that I got my wealth
Now I’m the man with the team that’s worked with under me
But I don’t trust none of them fools as far as I can see
I know I should cut em loose
Cause if they get caught and have to do 5 they turn me in and settle for 2
Plus they’re bringin me five g’s a day
I can’t let em go, I’m stuck, so I gota hit my knees and pray
Cause I’ma go out like I came in, a soldier
And if I get corner shopped, you all be sayin I told ya
And what I made is mine
Fuck you hoes tryin to find where my safe is at
You all get your face a smack
I don’t trust anybody
I be one locked up or dead nigga with a hidden safe full of money

[ CHORUS 1 & 2 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can’t give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can’t give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they’ll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

Yeah, muthafucka
Watch your backsides and your frontsides
Don’t trust any muthafuckin body
You can’t trust the white man
You can’t trust that janky bitch you’re with
You sho’ nuff can’t trust the next nigga
Come up to the head, bra
Get your money up
Fuck ya

[Verse 1]
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Don’t act like that’s a disease
Need y’all to bear with me please
I just say what I see
We all just chasing a dream
In the land of the free
While we paying a fee
To stay on this concrete
Well, I don’t know the price of your roof
But the first of the month we all pay our dues
When the rain falls it don’t rain on a few
When the sun shine it don’t shine just on you

[Bridge]
I don’t know the monsters you knew
But I’m trying to forget the ones I met too
Baby you could help me
Baby I could help you

[Chorus]
You look at me and you see what I see
Because your looking in the mirror
When your with me there’s no use in hiding
Because you’re looking in the mirror
Baby baby baby don’t look away
Because you’re looking in the mirror
Cause maybe maybe maybe we’re just the same
Because you’re looking in the mirror

[Verse 2]
We’re all crossing paths
For a reason I know that
Hoping just to share some laughs
Avoid the broken glass
Have I met you in the past
In a life that I lived last
You know they go too fast
God knows they go to fast

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby baby
Baby baby
It’s the same pain
And when I wake
I hear the same wave
Of sirens coming down my way
And I’ll never try to leave you
Baby your the one I cling to
Baby don’t look away
Baby don’t look away
I am you

[Chorus]

All rap for everybody, West Cola
Open up my 3rd eye, let my spirit speak
Time to re-unite the family
Military Mind, searchin for thug heaven
Bullys wit Fullys

{Verse 1}
Scrutinize my roots, and recognize the troops
I’m still a G with exceptional capabilities
I know they plottin on killin me, but it’s checkmate
Snake eyes, venomous tongue increasin death rates
It ain’t no love in this blood sport, county support is all we need
So many lost souls blinded by the liquor and weed
I made a change in my life and got some get right
Finally livin decent, no more creepin after midnight
I respect the words that my grandfather told to me
Don’t be innocent, militant is how we supposed to be
You know, God bless the child who can hold his own
Dodgin prison, still livin in my enemies zone
But I ain’t scared of death, you know we all die hard
You either charge it to the game or the Mastercard
The devil lurks when we hard at work, best to pray
Cuz when my homies call I’m quick to turn back to Killa Tay
It ain’t no fairy tale, the good Lord made me this way
Demon schemin on my soul to live and die in the Bay
I take steps through the valley of death
My thug religion got me pointin fingers at the system
My military mind, nine chambers deep, but still searchin for peace
M-O-B Cali G’s go to church and they sneak
Don’t judge me, unless we in court, for jury trial
I’m on a hunt, it’s fuck season ain’t no reason to smile
The first to die hard, the tragedy, agony of defeat
Military minded blinded by the sparks from the heat
It gets deep, I’m cheddar chasin, takin the fifth
I hustle heavy til my whole thug nation is rich
I put it down for Freddie Smith and Lil’ Toney Loc
Cuz they real folks representin the West Coast
The Mafia Clique, I take it back to when the Feds first hit
Paranoia in my brain, but ain’t no reason to trip
I come equipped ???, stick and move like Sugar Ray
Cuz it’s thug life, all day every day
Killas on the payroll, my soul rest with G-o-d
But ain’t no pity on my enemies, we still the realest
Let the games begin, I never die but I multiply
Buggin when the cops roll by, I’m still alive
Military mind got my fans thinkin I’m nuts
Pathetic visions til I finally touch, so let the world know

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope these Jews ain’t offended, but I’m AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain’t the truth, I know they lyin to us
It’s World War 3, ain’t nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it’s Black Power

{Verse 2}
Ain’t no future in frontin hard, the young and heartless
Raised with thug methods, still subjected to the darkness
Nowhere to hide, I’m being stalked by my shadow
My spirit grow slow, but now I’m losin my homies
I see this picture white clear, ain’t no love in these streets
Release my anger from the past, now I’m finally complete
I’m in a different world, livin right, my life brand new
You better recognize the real before it happen to you
My point of view is just opinion, but I’m smarter than most
And G-o-d the main reason I believe in the ghost
I know my close folks feel me, cuz my prayers been workin
I see these haters livin jealous, on the sideline smirkin
I punish enemies, they remember me, no way to forget
Cross the system, become the victim of a Mafia hit
I split the chips with my labelmates, we ballin again
Discussin hustlin with the lunatic when he call from the pen

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope my homies ain’t offended, but I’m AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain’t the truth, I know they lyin to us
It’s World War 3, ain’t nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it’s Black Power

{Verse 3}
I was dreamin but I swore I heard a voice yellin "wake up"
Tricked off half of my life, it’s time to make up
I’m walkin with the Lord, speakin from the Scriptures
Had my second son, but I lost another sister
To the dope game, believe me drugs kill
And my love’s real, so retrospect what a thug feel
I asked God to forgive my sins
And take the pain from my brain so I can live again
I know my grandmama spirit in me guidin me through
I know you hear them voices in ya head lyin to you
But what you see ain’t true, Lord knows we need help
Ain’t no knowledge being spread, all my people seek wealth
We ain’t lookin for ourself, tell me where the love at?
Daddy payin child support but momma hooked on dubb-sacks
Understand my anger, I ain’t no stranger to this danger
Orchestrate my clique, and it makes us a hazard

{Hook}
I declare war on the industry
I hope yo momma ain’t offended, but I’m AWOL, strictly independent
If you wanna sell rap you gotta buy it from us
Soundscan ain’t the truth, I know they lyin to us
It’s World War 3, ain’t nobody to trust
White man got a plan to see us all locked up
Instead of killin up yo own kind, focus yo mind
Check ya history, and see the signs, it’s Black Power

Yeah, we gotta understand
That it’s a white man’s job and plan
To infiltrate anything that the Black man does
Divide and conquer
We need unity, so stop killin up yo thug nations
And direct yo anger towards the real enemy
Ride or die

[Sticky’s talking]
See the way I got it figured the fucking whole world revolve around me
How you figured that? How you figured the world revlove around you?
When I get shot dont nobody feel that shit except for fucking me
If Idie the world is over
The world revolve around me just like the world revolve around you

[J. Blanco] I got you
[Sticky F.] Oh shit... yo, turn the mic up
[J. Blanco] Let these niggaz know what we talk about here

[Chorus:]
[J. Blanco] If you could see through my eyes, what would you see?
[Sticky F.] And if you’d seen what I saw, how would it be?

[Sticky]
Ain’t nothin I ain’t seen with this pair of eyes
I’ve seen niggaz get beaten ‘til they was paralysed
I’ve seen enough fighting to get this whole room high
Seen enough death to make the fucking whole world cry
I’ve seen cops on the take supplyin blocks for weight
I see niggaz who don’t care bust shoots at Jake
I’ve seen bitches at the club getting toxicated
When they awake can’t count how many cops she hate
You think the shit that happeneds to me affects you too

[J. Blanco]
Hell no, ‘cause you world revolve around you

[Sticky]
And my world revolve around me
You ain’t did what I’ve done

[J. Blanco]
And you ain’t seen what I’ve seen

[Sticky]
For everybody time moves different, for me it’s b-ball
Some niggaz see their world behind a cell and 3 walls
Some niggaz can’t see it at all
Some niggaz still in the dark
Some niggaz armied out smoking crows in the park

[Sticky’s singing]
If you get shot, hear, your moms’ll cry
But she wouldn’t feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die

[Chorus]

[J. Blanco]
See, in this thug-shit when the guns go it’s like time stand still
I’ve seen bullets move at them rapidly attacking their grill
So try to duck down and chill, adrenaline rushes, a second’s eternity
Flesh burning, a four-five I lift and I’ma turn at them
Bleedin intrnaly two in the throat, one in the lung
I’ve seen them trying to studder words having a seizure biting his tounge
I’ve seen my man down on the clod pavement left to die
Look in to his eyes caught chills seeing his soul in the sky
Seen the four-fours of outlaws barking at boys
They say it’s death when rain comes, it’s pouring cats and dogs
I see motherfuckers thinking like they got nine lifes
Got shot 9 times left behind their kids and their wifes
Through my eyes define, real, what’s the money you touch
The fast life’s a world of matrix eanbles us to touch
I can slide aside a killers mind and show you his sins
See I’m deep with the street like murdurer with blood on his Timbs

[Chorus]

[Sticky]
If you get shot, hear, your moms’ll cry
But she wouldn’t feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die

(Verse 1)
Yo, shit ain’t like it used to be, Not since puberty
Who knew our paths would happen to cross so what you do to me
But now I love you with every bit of my heart
How I used to get you wet when I hit it too hard
I can taste you on my lips, I even love your aroma
Please stay close to me, we’ll float into a coma
I love your red hair, I’m just dead air without you
Showed me the light with slight pools hype around you
You used to love crushed ice cold down your back
I’d try to swallow you whole, you rolled down the sack
But now it’s empty, you and I’m whipped, I’m lonely
A love letter to you, but yes I hope the phone rings

2x
Every penny I made I always brought straight to you
My thoughts never strayed, I stopped shaving it’s proof

(Verse 2)
If I can’t have you girl consider this the suicide note
I miss your mind games ever since you and I broke
At time you made it hard to breath hard to see the end
Please one more chance I’ll never let you slip through my hands again
I always showed your seeds love
You were never charmed
How’s it better this way, with an empty set of arms?
I know we said we had to let the air clear a few days
I thought I knew life, well then along you came
But now it’s too late
You were always more then just a friend to me
You’ve occupied everything in my short term memory
Sure there’s other fish in the sea
You snagged the line
Corny but cold in this empty sack of mine

2x
My friends ain’t seen you, said I should let it be
But yo girl you’ll probably be the death of me

You’re my source of inspiration, did I pass my limit?
We used to light an incense, we’d snap in the kitchen
Following our instincts with whipped cream in the dark
The chemistry between us when shit seems to get hard
We used to cut class to chill, we’d get alone I’d choke
Spittin’ shit I wrote for you, not just blowin’ smoke
No other will effect me in the same place that you touched
Sometimes I wish my friends would’ve never introduced us
You give me goosebumbs, but the truth is I love it
Sometimes too much to take, we used to do it in public
On the train in front of other people she never seemed to care
Where we was going ‘cause sweet love was in the air

[Thirstin Howl]
Poured blood, ignored love, even Thor trusted a little devil
in all us, the motor that keeps cheatin wives, lawns cut
At a fallen temperature before I’m even warmed up
At the speed of thought, thug niggaz fight for a needless cause
All you hear is "stop the stealing" when nearin stores
Uncommon Valour with the French make players take the bench
Above the rim without touchin the net
Thirsty, greedy, sometimes desperate
When I lock rap down I’ma booby trap the exit
Barracade the entrance, turn demonics screamin into harmless kids
Whispers, no challengers
Winnin the belt, if I say I’m top notch, I’d be just limitin myself
MC’s bore me like elevator music
Street panhandlers with ?three-socket? sewage
All A & R’s named Ufid
If life’s a bitch I’m one of her two kids
A motherfucker, if the show fits
If rap was a school I’d be teachin at Yale’s institution
Brooklyn hardrock, with a toothpick
Threatenin your life and safety with new risk
Scillionaire, after I burn MC’s I give ‘em 
  information on free clinic care

Chorus: All
You get one shot, one chance to bust
Who bust first? first to get slain
Playin Russian roulette
*repeat*

[Mr. Metaphor]
My lyrics sprout like a brussle, son
I get you open like a ?claire-o? mussle, I might jam my knuckle
Break it down raw like Brickface and stuck-o
Eat you like a dick steak you fucko! *echoes*
Whip you with my belt buckle, you wanna scuffle?
Pull your card while you suffer, I bag your bitch like a duffle
And grill you like a ?wild nigga? fall like ?Allah fall?
I remove your tonsels I’m out for kids like youth hostiles
Inhale force fires, blowin trees out my nostrils
Diggin underground like carbon pipes outta fossils
I wet you up like ponchos on a dark, stormy night
And spark forty mics, I beat you up like forty dykes in Brooklyn
You’ll get taken, tooken for every nook and cranny
I’ll stick your daughter and the nanny, take your baby’s candy
Grab the brandy out the cabinet 
Take any found inhabitant and make his mind inadequate
I spit my lyrics accurate, immaculate
Its hard to capture it you don’t got half my wit
You better find an advocate to plead your rapture
I leave your hands in the air, you leave in laughter
Stuck in the intro, I’m on the final chapter

Chorus

[Pumpkinhead]
I play roulette, with five bullets in the revolver
The problem solver, rhyme evolver, descendent of Ghana
Usin the marijuana to blaze niggaz like lava
Hot like sippin java in the sauna
I’m cold blooded like iguanas
My rhyme takes form, cock back the hammer on the biscuit
I make stroms, the weather wizard, hordes to never visit
Heaven’s gimmicks, my arms cross in b-boy positionin
Mix hydro with nitroglycerin
Pose with the mic in the tie hold lyrics hard like pistol whippen
I studied out the nigga mysticism
And still quick to catch you like prince of principal medism vision
I’m about to pull the trigger gotta make a quick decision
The sweat drippin cloudin my wisdom, lost my religion
I guess thats the cost of livin in this world
With no girl, no jewels or pearls
Confirmed my new script, my thoughts is suicidal sick
I pull the trigger all I hear is a click
My thoughts is sick, I pull the trigger all I hear was a *gunshot*

[Building Block]
Then I rise and shine from lies to blind the mind’s eyes
And ties that bind, you’ll find your rhymes are dime-sized
Compared to mine, you got no concepts
Eatin from my table of contents take words out of my context
My language is, like Arabic too complex
Got you mixed like marriages
My songs flex from my larynx, vex ya like a labyrinth
I stab ya with, my daggerith, your haverith
The Block hit, toxic material thats hazardous
Ya bring life like Christ of Nazareth, then Lazarous
Fabulous how I be rackin, presence to rap kiss
In fact this radioactive flows that hold you captive
Tracton’s own home is where this rapper roams
And catacombs, trap your poems and stay witcha like chaperones
Control it with a dart like Napoleon Bonaparte
You get stoned and sparked, bones and burn poems like Joan of Ark

Chorus

[Jonny Z]
Yes, yes, y’all
It’s ya boy, Jonny Z
And I got my homie
The South Park Mexican
And we gonna kick a little puro Latin bass
{*scratching*}

[Verse 1: Jonny Z]
Well, it’s Jonny Z and South Park, we’re ready to roll
Sport Versaces and a Rolex, and our pockets on swoll
Check in the pent house, the day of the show
Check them player haters too because we good to go
We roll in ‘99 Impalas with the 20 inch blades
Rollin’ hydro with my boy before I hit the stage
See, we just in town, for just one night
Makin’ freaks shake that ass when I grab the mic
Being born in the barrio, that’s were it all started
Pourin’ 40’s for my homies
Who are gone and departed
Now the jente give me props
When I walk in the place
The freaks give it up
When I show my face
You know I got love
That’s all I can say
They can’t get enough of puro Latin bass

[Jonny Z]
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"
"Yes y’all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
SPM and Jonny Z on another bomby
My G quick to pump, to pump the party
Will we quit, not me
Charlie
Likin’ my style cause I do ‘em doggy
Still I get jiggy
Here kitty, kitty
The finest girls I met are from a little bitty city
Big booty, big [{*titties*}], spendin’ twenties and fifties
I really don’t mind, cause to me, it’s just pennies
Sippin’ on Henny
Haters can’t offend me
Still I have your clique hollin’, "Who killed Kenny?"
High power player
Microphone slayer
Smokin’ red hair with the H-town mayor
Puro Latin bass
All in your face
I’m a watch the whole world all fall into place

[Jonny Z]
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"
"Yes y’all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"

(Verse 3)
[Jonny] Now the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
        Haters tryin’ to front
        But the ladies wanna get some
        Back at the momo
        Keep it on the low-low
        With this Latin player
        Who drives ‘em all loco
[SPM]   Bass in the attic of my Cadillac Seville
        Come around here, we can battle rap for real
        Got bang, shakin’ walls
        And rattlin’ the house
        Lettin’ boys know who the baddest in the south
        Never bow down, represent my cow town
        Smokin’ on the pow wow, bet you feel my style now
        Hella pipe players
        Dress like I’m Adais
        Boys wanna spray us
        Girls shake they ass
[Jonny] Cause you know we got love, that’s all I can say
        They can’t get enough of puro Latin bass

[Jonny Z]
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"
"Yes y’all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y’all"
{*scratching*}

Verse 1:

I’m higher in degree, and speak accordingly
To the society I see, left in fire and debris
Variety is key, need knowledge to be free
Like the priory of scion, supply it with a fee
They inspire me to be, wise as a chief
Undermining the plea and fill their lines with deceit
Attire of the street, wear wires underneath
Most of the records you buying they lying through their teeth
Denying the grief
Where they from and become empty
Unfriendly, some weak some deadly
Increase salary, become wealthy
But its hard to achieve when your mentality is unhealthy
The slum felt me,purists know marx will rock
Every recording dropped from your squadron flopped
Talk about them in the parking lot
To the barbershop regardless if they frauds or not
Access denied perils had the border locked
Cook it up serve it straight from a scorching pot
They say marxman you ought to stop
Your styles too underground kid unorthodox
Stalk the blocks like we warring with the armored cops
Who had the corners blocked, with their revolvers cocked
Forces plot to let your carcass rot
Beneath foreign crops
So I’m sending out warning shots

Verse 2:

I came to build a nation with the skill of a mason
Executing an industry infiltration
Face humiliation,with a losing strategy
Some claim affiliation, but I only move with family
Dudes produce trash to me
Kept their eyes on loot, lust and fantasy
Step inside the booth and I’m just glad to be
Write the truth annually
What you would do for salary
This music is therapeutic to june and his agony
And it soothes my insanity
I use it to diffuse anything that saddens me
And apparently, they got hidden motives
Venom spittin cobras, in the scripts I focus
Give eviction notice, to traitors and thats that
Labeled backpack if your language abstract
I aim past rap, notice if the bars simple
still a jewel just decode it like the lost symbol

Hook:

It’s like I speak another language
And they cease to understand it
I speak what they seek in the tablet
And they cease to understand it
It’s like a whole nother dialect
I embrace the truth while their hiding it
My environment, read it like data
They will come and go like seasons in nature
Born on the equator, southeast asia
Some praise his efforts,some doubt hes greater
Calling him a savior, label him an anti christ
Maybe hes the product of some alcohol and bad advice
Still his craft is nice, willing to sacrifice
Blast and slice for a small glimpse of paradise
I wrote body of god to walk the path of christ
And still go to war with any of your acolytes
June Marx transmit it through the satelites

[ VERSE 1: MC Twist ]
MC’s step aside, it’s my turn
I’m so hot, I’m about to burn
My temperature passed 102
So all you suckers, I will melt you
It’s confusion but I’m makin it clear
My intention is to reach your ear
To make the beat move your fear so you dance
(Party people in the house) here’s your chance
To put on your shoes, put on your clothes
And just rock till the party grows
To the point where the joint is filled
I’m hard, I don’t need a shield
To any suckers that’s in my line
And right now I’m ready to unwind
And get loose as the bass thumps
And when I do - the house jumps

[ VERSE 2: MC Twist ]
I always dominate the show
Could anybody else? (Hell no!)
I’m top dog, the hog from San Jo
And I want y’all out there to know
I’m not a fake and now I’m at the top
So remember that I will not stop
Get filthy when you hear this groove
Break it down (down) now move
Your feet and stay on track
Grab a girl, freak her from the back
Don’t hold up the wall, don’t keep yourself still
(Do you really wanna party?) No need to chill
Pay attention to girls wearin thights
You want them for your lonely nights
Miniskirts and pumps with some big old rumps
And when you see em - the house jumps

[ VERSE 3: MC Twist ]
I need a freak with a pretty smile
So we can do it, love American style
That’s the game that I wanna play
And if I do everything I say
Just maybe I want you for my girl
I kick you down with one big pearl
But don’t simp sayin I love you
Because the boys from my crew
They won’t take it, and we’re in effect
At the same time we’re gettin respect
Boy Flash gets the party goin
KJ keeps the groove flowin
When I rap to the groove
I say together we’ll make you move
So get with it when the music pumps
And when you do - the house jumps

Yeah
Yo Flash, make the tables talk
(Bust this) (this) (beat)

[Intro: Hurricane Chris]
It’s been a long time comin
They wonder why I act like this, you heard me
It’s all I know

[Nicole Wray]
They see us, still got much to learn
But otherwise still got money to burn
I’m in the streets can’t take it out of me
I get money, get money, that’s all I know

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise still I got money to burn
I’m in the streets can’t take it out of me
Get money, get money, that’s all I know

[Hurricane Chris]
How could you criticize me for actin like I act if I ain’t never had a thing
My daddy got locked up when I was 12, my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and did (?) to get the bills paid
While you was probably ridin around the city in your Escalade
But now that I got money, I went and bought me two mansions
Just to stunt on them niggaz who told me I never had it
I walked out the door the other day and my momma told me
You got a lot of nerve, she told me just because we got all this money to burn
Don’t think you can’t be in terms
A cold victim to the street so I stay packin some heat
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, ‘cause they creep
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, I’m a beast

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I’m 18 years old and I done seen more drama than that lil’bit
Go on and (?) to talk about it unless you hear this
My pedal to the medal while I’m thinkin about all of my dogs
I lost in the street tryna ball like me
And this is for my niggaz who used to roll gold D
Poppin the trunk on them swingers, hoppin out in tall tees
So all my niggaz that’s ballin and feel like me
From the struggle, you gutter to makin a lot of G
Keep my head up, remember who got me right where I’m at today
Long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say
One thing I know for sure I’ma get paper ‘til it ain’t no more
Plus I got a crazy flow\xc2\x85huh
I know somebody say "A hard head make a soft ass"
That’s why I keep the glock on the seat when I’m ridin in my jag
51/50, you don’t know nothin about me
Homeboy I’m a (?), still ain’t learn

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I’m makin money, nigga you can’t tell me shit
I’m gon’ keep on stuntin, steady shinin on the haters

[Nicole Wray]
I’m countin money, doin my thang, I be hustlin
From Monday to Sunday, doin what I want, I be gettin it in

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Levi 167]
Right about now (right about now)
We’re gonna give you something a little.. (a little)
Dope dope, d-dope dope, dope
Dope dope, d-dope dope
But before we get into somethin dope
I wanna know all y’all homeboys out there ready to play the game (YEAH!)
Fly girls out there do you know how to play the game? (YEAH!)
Party people do we need any rules for this game? (NO!!)
So let’s play
 
Well, I’m, Levi, one-six-seven 
Feel stupin and troopin because this party is hoopin
You see I do not bribe because I like to broil 
Mc competition that makes my blood boil
Just Levi! 
Lurkin’ searchin to any type of virgin (?)
while I’m up on stage operating like a surgeon
Comin AT your face, for no apparent reason
Style and ‘n chill what you get is outta season 
Let the fact remain, as an artist I reign
Don’t try to get a rap over snatchin’ someone’s rope chain
I teach the lesson, because they see I’m fresh and...
Cause when this jam is verbally rocked I leave a good impression
Make no exceptions for the passengers in sections
They come up with the dope entertainer to rock this jam session
This is the game, and we’re all a bunch of fame
Party people in the house what’s my name?
Levi! One-six-seven
 
Certainly, you think it’s hard work for me
Over blunts and tea, I write the dope lyrics easily
See I have arrived to rock you live
Throwin up with many discos and adult street joints qualified
Distant in the visual, in rap not a musical
Combining dope rhymes and beats to rock as usual
Slayin the hit list, only suckers get dissed
My job’s to rock, so c’mon and let’s do this
Spit knowledge off the head, my partner is a dread
Bronx New York is where we live, and I have come to give
A concept out of a lecture, more like a mild sedative
Calm, not loud in a rage
Still kickin’ lyrics keep a / / / / / day
Something new I kick to you
And your posse to dance to
The title of the cut is something fresh to swing to
Even KRS and ICU will say respect .......to Levi 
One Six Seven
Rocking for the moment, taking out opponents
Writing down the dope rhyms while stacking on Dunking Donuts
With any conversation with the opposite sex
They always seem to think OF what can happen next
I seem to see myself as an mc proffesor
Never take lesson from a lady so I test her
Naturally violent, but I quicker undresss her
But proud of what it takes for LEE ... why sin (?) impress her
After she’s impressed like a damsel in distress
I scheme to ask her whereabouts and address
If she tells me, then I’m on, if she doesn’t then I’m gone
But what I have to say you see it has to go to spawn
Cause I’m Levi , a self-conscious person
Never fail in rhymes cause I write and rehearse them
Written and perfected, corrected and wrote
The moral of the story is I think fly girls are
Fly girls are, fly girls are... dope dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
 
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope
Dope dope
D-dope dope, dope {*fades*}

Splatter heads across the camera lens I’ve heard enough lies
No truth honesty’s a smokin gun
While watchin the world on television I bury my dome in drugs
Yea I shot Nixon shot Reagan this is Non Phixion
Stop hittin I’m gettin paper I’m not patient

Of Kids that get to the point at the flip of a coin
I’ll stab you and your boys where your groin and your belly join
I twist a knife I live a sadistic life
Your whole team will be sniffin codine
To stop the pain from the nose bleed like a coke feind
You get duffed even if I was hand cuffed
Every cat in my click could stand up
I’ll crack you in your skull with so many bombs
you’ll look like you hit a bong like you was Chong
I’m waitin for you with so much hate
You can bag it up light weight and sell it to anyone that escapes
You got a nickle plate but I manipulate
The 38 out of your head and bust your chest plate

Everything was fly boy, til I took this little bullet 
leaving traces of cyanide in my thyroid 
Not, one of you wanna be busters gave a fuck! 
Just out here chucklin on 
The corner bout these war stories  
Some more glory for the gat!  
Glory for the snaps, crack the hoodrats 
I use to think that it was good but 
Fuck that! Now i’m the one witches are hating 
Because . . .  Bombs keep reiterating  
Sista it dont take, earl to get a clue  
On what you lovely cluckers are thinkin 
you want to plan and try to do, but to who? 
Cuz im a take a few, with me  
Leaving caps all off in your femor, collar bone and kidneys!  
Then im out to chase papes throwin bricks to rake in diamonds  
On some new thing in some cackys and carefully criming

Hook:  uh! (repeat)

You ask how could I kill a snake? On my real estate!  
Cuz i can feel a fake phony comin’ at me from a whole hemisphere away! 
And what-do-ya know my former homey wants to roam 
In my circumference  
Now my bump the dumb thang its on!  
So give it up cuz i’m so crazy!  Trip! Hey!  
A nine is a terrible thing to waist 
So i bring it, like i sing it just in case you 
Biting the hand that feeds you, and plus you ain’t said your grace  
I guess them stiches in yo face, wasn’t enough to stop another fiasco 
That’s exactly what you askin’ fo hoe!  
But when napalm, like bombs, are dropped i 
Don’t see how any one can really remain calm  
My target was her head!  
So settle for metal returning your mental into lead bleeeed heffer!!  
Bo$$ is back and ain’t na sista celebrating  (mmmm...) 
Wonder if hey can tell I’m satan?  
Why you tailgating?  Break trick!  You out there bad!  
Its time to swag, off ya baby’s daddy  
Look at em’ still slangin’, still flaming

Bridge:  (repeat 1st part of hook) 

Oooooh don’t let me catch ya creepin (fool)
I’m sleepin’ with my eyes (like a)
open wide (with a dildo for real doe) 
(well hello hello)   
We got the roughest, toughest "g" ya ever seen ya’ll   
Toughest "g" ya ever seen ya’ll 
(well hello hello)  
Bo$$ breaking, "g" ya ever seen ya’ll  
Very intelligent but still a’ break ya jaw offfff,  
(well hello hello)  
Trigger happy, laughing with a sawed offff,  
Shot gun  
The most scantless "g" ya ever saw,  
Rough tough quick to snuff and call ya fuckin bluff 
Dat "g", dat "g", dat "g", dat "g" 

[Bo$$]
Mousse, Mousse wants to douse me, douse me  
With some bullets if you think ya can, can  
Go through with ya plan!  
Use to be the cool sista you could kick it with  
Now i’m feelin wicked again and finna’ trip! 
Sad girl is living in a mad world  
Because my baby represents ernesto and 
Like a bitch she had a girl!  
And on the cool mona know that i’m the locest, trust 
But while we tripping some cocazoid put the joke on us 
(us, us, us, us) Rest in peace as we build a nation  
Whisper to giggles, time to build our own operation  
Cuz our men are just about skins and bustin over a truck  
But i could give a  damn about 500 bucks?  
What about the runnin’, catchin’ bullets, and the killings? 
What goes around comes back around to hit our siblings 
If we don’t recognize that we don’t 
Own the streets we roamin’ 
The worse encounter of our kind will be the omen!  
While we...... 

Hook:  (repeat)

Da org? Original righteous g’s (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Caution, red alert, time to do work
Mammy with the wet lips sippin on some crist’
And em
Over there, honey drinking double dares
Smoking blunts everywhere sayin peace to Premier
Yeah, ass shakin, get this thing poppin
Ass for the takin, got that shit rockin
Bitches one side, niggas on the next
We thinkin about cake, they talkin about sex
I’m talkin toastas and roastas, ain’t always tryin to pose
I’m gettin closer and closer that gun push your nose up
Y’all feel, me feel me, even if you can’t see me
From the streets to the beat, let it go, yo watch me freak
Okay, here’s the final round, this is how it goes down
I got six loaded clips, sick corroded clips
Double dare everywhere, Hennesee and the Cris’
We gettin drunk and smoked out whole room gettin choked out
Hydro and a flow, this bitch wanna talk but nope
Stay strong, nothing love of my team
The part I play is wrong, but we got to get the dream
By any means we stay doin our thing
Motherfuckers so dumb they can’t figure where it’s coming from
They got schools wrong, all they do is pull triggers
All they do: dig out bitches, some even diggin niggas
What the fuck? The rap game changin everyday
Hard rocks walk away, now this shit is turning gay
All I say, you come hear it with me, you get your shit broke the fuck up
Your cap get twisted, I spit it
Just Ice, collossus, immortal
Any time that I come I got some bangin shit for you
so y’all just chill, sit back relax

Look, I’m from the streets where them kids like clapping
??? got themselves the midnight dragon
Got right out the game and had to get right back in
Any day, shit might happen
And that be on the real, cats be on your heels
Cats beyond reveal
I got niggas that seen trial
I got some niggas about to walk the green mile
Up in the penial
Meanwhile i try to excel deeper
Make my pockets smell sweeter
With cheddar spreading more than bel vida
Make sure you flip the dough
In the the two triple o
Come through sip the Mo’
I be that true gigolo
See me gettin assed in the ride
Scrub style from the passenger side
You askin to die?
Shit, couldn’t fuck with this on your best night
I scream let’s fight
Niggas turn transvestite
And don’t dress right
When the red light is headed at your chest sight
You just might, wanna check your vest tight, nigga

I think it’s time we had a little conversation
Me and you
I’m willing to admit it’s overdue
See I’m feeling like life’s animation
And these two-dimensional story-boards are wearing thin
So let me have your exclusive undivided attention
Grab a blank notebook and a fresh pen
Where do I begin if I don’t know the origin?
How do I explain why I can’t sleep for weeks without medicine?
You wanna hear the most recent aggravation?
Every time I touch the mic I get a standing ovation
But it’s probably ‘cause there’s no seats in here
So let me see you on your feet in here
You got a man speaking here
But all they wanna do is cry into their beers
But that’s trivial, typical, predictable behavior
I can’t blame ya
I’d probably do the same without my savior
I come home at night and write scripture
But somewhere back there I lost the big picture
You paying attention, man?
This fifty bucks an hour ain’t cheap
And I didn’t come here to speak to dead meat
I guess that’s why the little tape recorder’s running
So you can play me back later, analyze my behavior
Give it to your neighbors and other strangers
Then y’all can laugh at my expenses, no pun intended
And make new conversation about the new patient you’re working with

Step one is to admit you’ve got a problem
Step two is to help your fucking self
Step three is theoretical
Some sort of positive progression toward the unattainable

I think it’s time we had a little conversation
Me and you
I’ve seen what you can do
Rearranging concrete mind states
Complicated mental cases putting on a happy face
Without booze or freebase
I got a good friend with a strong faith
He says if I can find mine I’ll stop wandering space
I’ve researched your work and made several comparisons
And I think with the right approach, you might be on to something
So I come to you defenseless
Balls on the table
I got plenty to lose and plenty more to be thankful for
But more times than not I’m starting wars ‘cause I’m bored
This is J. Moore
Slightly transformed and off topic
Too many years removed from when I thought I knew my conscious
And last time I checked I had more than one accomplice
Which upgrades my status from ignorance to bliss
So please tell me what’s the difference
So write it all down and read it back so we can hear it out loud
Eject button out the mind, through the mouth
I must need this more than money ‘cause it’s costing me
It must be love, ‘cause I hurt it but it follows me
And it’s growing, I can feel it deep inside of me
It’s like the new cult religion for the lost generation causalities
For all of y’all that can’t figure it right
I’m not talking to the shrink, I’m talking to the mic

Step one is to admit you’ve got a problem
Step two is to help your fucking self
Step three is theoretical
Some sort of positive progression toward the unattainable

{All y’all haters..}
[WC] Yeah.. what’s crackin ni’a?
[WC] What’s crackin ni’a?
{All y’all haters..}

[WC] Straight out the womb homey
{All y’all haters..}
[WC] I got a question; and it goes like this

[WC]
The question at hand - is how should I bang these, slang these
Get ‘em all to pullin out them hankies (uh-huh)
Flip a cup to this, click it, load it up and bust to this
Kick up dust to this, bust a U lay chalk to this to walk to this
Stick you, hit you with one whistle {*whistling*} (ONE!)
It’s that rag hot twist doe (uh-huh) anti-disco (uh-huh)
Long time, long see
But we gon’ put this rider car back together
but gangsta’s how it’s gon’ be (ni’a!)
Stand up, nigga throw yo’ hands up
Wipe it off, crack it open loc’ and turn the can up
It’s that G from the heart known for creepin in the dark
And like Cyrus fool, I’m callin a meetin in the park (ni’a!)
In Broughams and khakis, hoppin out the two-thousand-and-two Caddy
Loc’ it’s Dub C and Cavi
Cast it up, nigga smoke to this, gangstas dog and loc’ to this
Real niggaz roll to this

[Chorus: *sung*]
All y’all haters gon’ talk to this
And all real gangstas gon’ walk to this
Cause all true players gon’ mack to this
Bump a rack to this, you know clap to this
Cause some of y’all niggaz can’t play the game
Cause some of y’all niggaz can’t do the thang
Cause half of y’all niggaz is scared of fame
We chase the dreams and fulfill the game

[Caviar]
Catch me in this MC or catch me in a double-R
G’d up and star (who is you?) Caviar
Cold ass nigga when it comes to my chippers
I’m nutty as a Snicker when it comes to legal tender
Currency collector, bring it back now selector
Catch a lick slippin and I’m quick to intercept her
Cash like a pass, mash to keep it comin
Mr. Keep-A-Fat-Knot, I’m always up to somethin
To get another tizzack, I bet the new llizzac
be on chrome feet, TV’s with beat
Matchin (?) do’s with the PS2’s
Smokin Kervorkian, sippin VS2
(Fo’ sha’) Big dollars, Impalas
Caviar got that bombay holla (oooh-ooh!)
Haters hate to this, and lowriders scrape to this
And all my real riders bounce rock skate to this

[Chorus]

[WC]
Ghetto glamour, rolled up with my thumb on my hammer (clik clak)
Lookin like I’m dealin with mo’ snow than Santa
Chronic in my lungs nigga, ice on my neck
Twenty-two’s on my truck, niggaz after my deck (bump bump)
Dank I need it to mash but it’s time to ride
And for my niggaz incarcerated I grind and push this line (ni’a)
Sip malt liquor twist braids straight bankin
G’d up and fo’ all y’all I’ma stay swangin

[Caviar]
Oh yeah, you know we stay on that gangsta page
Golf hats, Romeos, twelve gauge and braids
O.T. trips, cutties with Euro clips
Keep ‘em smokin Gladys Knight with the E on the Pip
Dip with new fits and whips so we can twist
like Daytons, got my revenue stop hatin
In the paint Cavi’ go hard on y’all
Boss ballin y’all, this fo’ all y’all ni’a

[Chorus]

{All y’all haters..}
[WC] What’s crackin?  Dub C and Cavi
{All y’all haters..}
[WC] Fort Knox, bandanna swangin collab’
[WC] Y’all know what time it is
{All y’all haters gon’ talk to this..}
[WC] Heh heh, yeah, Exit Wounds, Exit Wounds
{All y’all haters..}
[WC] Puttin in work, Fort Knox
{All y’all haters..}

{Let me just say this}
[You know what I’m saying]
{You’re a very pretty girl}
[You know it’s a lie
Aaaaah]
{Where’s your attitude, which was ugly as a motherfucker
You really need to tighten that shit up}
[That was real, that’s real
How you make me feel sugar, god damn!]
{You got to fix yourself}
[You know everything is everything]
{‘Cause there’s gonna be one nigga... that might just snap on your ass}

[Choclair]
It’s 10:15 up in the AM, scratch the back, cough the phlegm
I hear the phone ringing
I wipe the sleep from the tear ducks
Phone’s ringing, sun’s blazing through the curtains
Ignore the phone calls, pager bawls
Check the number, its 4-1-6-K-C-T-2-2-6-4
The 3 means for me to go an call back immediately
I call back and ID myself as the Chizz-knocka

[Saukrates]
Yo, what up potna?  I got a little story to tell
About this heavy chickenheaded, brow eye cocktail
Nipples like pickles, did her well to the dills
Spinning in the background, all I could hear was wedding bells
‘Cause the cock had me locked on pussy detention
Forgot to mention ass cheeks was heavy, broke my suspension
And even got to say what happened
Her body language spoke a new form of rapping
Pussy so tight she grabbed my dick with it and started clapping
When we were done, she said ‘thank you sugar’ (sugar)
I analyzed her barbed wire tattoo ‘round her ankles
Would have taken the time to study it before I hit it
Was killing to get in it, 
so I choose to peep the G right after we done did it
I’m telling you this because I’m the sweet pussy critic
I reminisce on ass, pussy, tits and thick lips all over my long prick
You the shit brown eyes, you the shit’s what I said
I see you doing movies, getting all up in my nigga’s head
Peep what I said, you the bomb and my mind is caught
But listen, the dick is long but the time is short, it’s you I’m dissing
You pissing in the wind sugar, I’m ice cold
You ain’t never gonna win sugar, I’m twice as bold
As the average pussy chasing, look who you facing
I read you body language, now please get out my basement

[Choclair]
But that some shit nigga
I bet if you wanted to, 
you’d make that pussy drip like your snotbox up in the winter
Or watch your picture
I knew this trick that was similar to yours
With the tits that stood up, just like the lights upon an ‘89 Accord
As sharp as a sword, with these nipples like ?????
I was like farmer Brown, ‘cause I was picking to get in it 
Her body looked stolen from a Stacey Dash mold
If you seen the hold on that ass, shit! (shit)
The cactus had my brain blitzed like I’m smoking L’s up in the stairs
My pipe is getting full with the liquid joe(?)
Yo, I wanted to unload and make it spread like pour-ed milk on the floor
The center fold, had me rocked if I stood up
Her shoulders being tapped, yo I’m fiending for the cat
I wonder if she’ll feel me
I’m breaking through my jeans, lips looking mad big
Like she could suck the green off army fatigues
Body smooth like a GS3, double ooh on the body I would do
She can take the Chizz right out the knock-aaah
You guess you get rock more tricks than the sea
For the Chizz-y (chizz-y), real-ly (real-ly)
You see you just pissing in the wind sugar, I’m ice cold
You ain’t never gonna win sugar, I’m twice as bold
As the average pussy chasing, look who you facing
I read you body language, now please get out my basement

OUTRO [Saukrates]
Let’s go conquistadoris, chocola-tay, Oooooww
Aight, bring it back so I could double this

[Verse 1]
Youngin on the block with his 30-shot
Visions in his head of when he seen his little brother got
Feelin’ like he could go and die in this very spot
At a very young age, his tired eyes done seen a lot
Part-time jobs keep some food on the table
He move a couple bags to keep his little sister’s cable
His mama always struggle, but she’s willing and she’s faithful
When you lookin’ at God like "how long this finna take you, dawg?"
All I need is one chance to make it out this shit
I know that all this drama can’t be really in the script
Then the life I wanna live may never come
And every chance I had is done until I’m at square one, like we never done...

[Chorus: x2]
Part time love is the life round here
We never done...
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day

[Verse 2]
You grow to learn every bitch know every bitch, every nigga is a snitch
They lettin’ everybody in the game, it’s gotta be a glitch
Everybody sellin’ somethin’, everybody got a pitch
You want a hit, but can’t touch base with people that’s legit
Every man stand on his own feet, if he don’t work, he don’t eat
Fakes don’t last long, long money, toke the strong
He heard of flights being flown, he wanna get inside that zone
Wanna see a land unknown, get the money, bring it home
Just wanna tell him reach his goals all day
Get the crib, do it big with the long-haul weight
Send some money to the bros and the hoes, y’all wait
It seem far, but I see it - that full time, I need it

[Chorus]

You was my girl, we had a good thing
Never thought that things would change
Cuz you would always say, the only one for you
Everything was great, the love we made was great
Never thought I would see the day
When you would slip away, run off with somebody new
I tried to understand what I did wrong to make you leave
But I did the that best I can
There’s no other guy who’s gonna love you like I did
Now you know that I’m doin’ good
Heard the buzz about me blowin’ in the hood
You made a mistake
You played the wrong man so:
I won’t lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won’t save no shit from you
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
I’ll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you’ll regret that you’re no longer the one standing next to me
I won’t hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I’ll make you hate yourself for this
Gonna make you hate yourself
Regret the fact you ever doubted me
At times I felt like we would would never ever part
But I don’t really care anymore
Cuz thinkin’ ‘bout the things that you did u didn’t really care
Like when I was with that group Code 5
You used to act like you was by my side
I trusted, I needed you
And all you ever did was mess around with my fam
And talk behind my back
Damn I really hated that
But see now you’re gonna pay for that
And live with the fact that we’ll never be one again
Unless I choose to, bitch I’ma be cruel too
And let you know that I’m the shit
And that’s just somethin’ that your gonna have to learn to get used to

I won’t lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won’t save no shit from you
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
I’ll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you’ll regret that you’re no longer the one standing next to me
I won’t hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I’ll make you hate yourself for this
Nowadays I gotta change my cell phone number every week
Cuz somebody’s always hittin’ my Nextel askin’ me whats goin’ on with XL
Mami I know the reason that you reachin’ out
Cuz the secret on the street’s been leakin’ out
Heard different people speakin’ ‘bout XL
And you seemin’ to be left out, oh well
Don’t hate me, you should hate yourself
Cuz you tried to play me and you played yourself
And now lately you been feelin’ the blues
You was eager to play the game and ain’t know the rules
Fouled out which means I found out
You wasn’t really ridin’ was you?
And now because you, heard that I’m heavy in the streets
You wantin’ me back but uh, it’s a wrap for you!
I won’t lose sleep over you
I will not cry over you
I won’t save no shit from you
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
I’ll date every girl I see
And make sure that you see me
And you’ll regret that you’re no longer the one standing next to me
I won’t hate on what you do
When you find somebody new
And realize you were a fool
But instead here’s what I’ll do:
Shake my head with such disgrace
And throw my success in your face
To be back with me is what you wish
I’ll make you hate yourself for this
It’s a wrap
So what u need to do is
Take my numbers out your phone
Don’t be callin’ my crib no more’
Don’t be tellin’ your friends to tell my friends to tell me nothin
And tell your lil’ brother when he see me on the street
Dont be runnin’ up to me givin’ me dap and all that cuz we ain’t cool like that
Oh yeah, remember that time I told you I loved you?
I LIED!

Sample: I want you to know the power of the underground
Sample: Man, I’ve seen some serious shit

[Kory Calico]
Ayo my crew is simply, tryin’ to blow like Lewinsky
Without internships, burnin’ shit like faulty furnaces
Concerned with this? Your shit’s like ??? turnin’ tricks
No question, couldn’t fake it if I was pro-wrestlin’
Leave my foes restin’ in less than 24 seconds
Trained in the deadliest guerilla war methods
In actuality, my rhymes would blind y’all, verbal brilliance
Calico got shine like Pine-Sol, define all
A lyricist, with superior genetic attributes
When I spit, your rhymes look laughable, I blast your crew
Into oblivion, lyrics hotter than Caribbean
Islands, criss-crossin’ the Meridian
Ayo I bomb spots, to set it like alarm clocks
With lyrics hotter than television sets at pawn shops
Beyond hot, aint shit y’all can tell me
You couldn’t step to me doing a fraternity helming

[DJ KNO-MERCY]
Ayo, I touch more heads than Selsun Blue
Runni’ shit even when I’m drunk just like Boris Yeltsen do
Melt your crew, thermo-nuclear device
And my shit’s so nice, my anus won a Nobel Peace prize
Do you see these guys rappin’? And do you know what would happen
If we started clappin’ at wack men?
Blowin’ shit up like disintary ignitions
You couldn’t be on top in the missionary position
I’m splittin’, every intention of wack rappers to injure this
Leavin’ these hermaphrodite emcees genderless
I’m sendin’ this blast through your faulty armor
You gets no ass, I cut chicken heads like poultry farmers
I’ll quote your Momma, you’ll never be shit
Got you shook, like an epileptic skinhead at Freaknik
I freak shit, fuck bein’ jiggy
Cause beatin’ you is like a new Puff Daddy video, no Biggie

[El Juba]
El Juba’s a Continuum foot soldier, in one grand corps
GOD body, we utter automatic machine metaphors
Let a war break out, Continuum take out
The target, with bullets we blast for Black markets
The madness, burst your brain when you hawk it
Sparks, flash through the fog and burn darkness
Escalate the conflict like Kosovo
Lick a shot from my cosmic glock like Han Solo
Calico, peel out! Scout dolo, Kno scramble the track,
Turrizt Rugah Pro Stahh & Jugga, attack!
These are the times that test loyalties
Of company we kept before bonus and royalties
Advance me, past these antsy fancy-ass crooks
With blood contracts and dirty books 
Past flirty girlies & herbs with murda looks
Warrick Dunn running, we lick shots then we shook the beast
That took the peace of mind, from me and mine
Out in the field, out in the real
Chaos and pain and loss
They wanna show us who’s boss
But the cost was the Molotov bombs that we tossed like "BOOM!"

[Jugga the Bully]
We head formal league divisions
You couldn’t see Continuum if you tested phototype lenses in Ciba vision
Your rhymes need revision
Some editorial, my victim list reads like the Vietnam vet memorial
Find your name, your time is game
You rhyme in vain through weed clouds, I shine in rain
And dim the darkness, emcees get run down like I’m passin’
The times on their low-rent apartments
I flow liquid, boilin’ rhymes ‘til they turn into steam
Stream-of-consciousness, burnin’ your team
Diffusin’ through, abusing crews
Leaving students bruised cruisin’ in Borg ships, amused by you Rubix cubes
Can you solve it? Probably not
Jugga revolves with planet gravitational pull
The Earth hault to elevate like my prose pole-vaulted
Dissolve kids in acidic solvents, thoughts get altered
Like pants’ hems, fuck y’all anthems
Targeted for artists by the FDA, for servin’ raw shit
It aint my fault, bitch, I warned y’all, I’m hydrochloric
Digital, Kno made the .WAV files with Tidal Forces

Can’t talk to ya cause she keep an attitude
Hid the stash, hit the cash, ain’t ask to borrow
Lookin at it ain’t a loss I’ll make it up tomorrow
Holla-in at my man sayin I’ll see y’all tomorrow

Something that ya give to ‘em can’t take it

Brown, put up a candle ha yellow vanilla
Chocolate milk is all tellin them apart
They look the same when they layin in the dark
She aight as long as she’s playin your part
Rough sex while I pull your hair
Lookin up ankle bracelet in the air
Layin the rick a majigum sex matism (girl)
I chose to freak ‘em and stick ‘em rather than lick em
Ooh little mama over there with that toe ring
Roll it in cocaine and hide it in propane

[First Verse]
What’s goin’ on party people, gangstas, gangstresses, and skee-holes
I know y’all feeling my lingo, this just a throwaway record, not the single
Your favorite rapper, even he know, but he don’t wanna give it up, he got a ego
He ain’t hot on the streets though, I came to take what he got like the repo
See every hood got a Deebo, back niggas down while they playing cee-lo
Some niggas try to play hero, but they scared to death of him on the lee-low
They say they can’t wait till he go, but when he died, they cried R.I.P.  yo
If you feelin’ what I mean though, grip your fuckin’ Desert Eagles

[Chorus]
You ever had a gangsta around your way
tellin’ niggas they can’t hustle unless they pay
He used to stick up all the weed spots
he got chased by the beat cops
You heard shots he was to blame
man they used to curse his name, but when that boy died it rained
You ever had a gangsta around your way
walk up to the dice game, niggas scared to play
He used to stick up all the crack spots
he got chased by the black cops
You heard shots he was to blame
man they used to curse his name, but when that boy died it rained

[Second Verse]
Front on Saratoga, you won’t make it to Howard
don’t come around here with that, we don’t allow it
While I’m in the crib telling my girl to iron my outfit
niggas outside bustin’ shots like they ‘bout it
I can’t tell you how many shots, I couldn’t count it
but I could tell it was somethin’ big the way it sounded
I dried myself off with a towel after I showered
came outside with the hammer, no doubt about it
This nigga layed out, the people had him surrounded
"Call a ambulance, I’m shot", that’s what he shouted
Niggas making my hood hot, they gon’ get outed
If they was lookin’ for some drama they just found it
They say he a powerful man, but he a coward
he think he powerful but he ‘bout to get overpowered
Yea I know his crew roll deep, I wouldn’t doubt it
to me that only mean his funeral gon’ get crowded

[Chorus]

[Third Verse]
I see a lot of new faces, tell them niggas to clear it out
walkin’ through ‘em, I ain’t talkin’ to ‘em, I air ‘em out
Shake a nigga hand, if he a fan, I hear him out
stand in my stance, if he take a chance, I wear ‘em out
You said you know kid and I went in your man mouth
keep it to yourself, I don’t care what you care about
Niggas play tough but at time it pan out
got a lot of rocks in my watch - it stand out
So fly, man I even iced my band out
I’m flyer than the cars that the promoter hand out
But that’s another subject, it’s a upset
see your homie suffer, you wonder who gon’ get touched next
I handle my own drama, niggas is suspect
watch you get shot, they stand there with the rubber neck
Touch one of mines, I leave a motherfucker wet
This for the G’s who died, much respect

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, it rained when my homie Mel Greene died
It rained when the god Ball True died
It rained when my homie Ran-Ran died
It rained when that nigga Ike Polo died
It rained when the god Allah died
Yeah, all my homies who went back to the essence... gone but not forgotten
The list goes on... Told y’all I was gon’ make it... Thug-A-Cation

-Talib Kweli-
[Chorus]
Turn the lights down low and the speakers up high
Feel the energy that we bringing inside
Doin it right, ridin all night
Payin the price, livin the lives

[Georgia Anne Muldrow]
Simply a joy to be next to you
Such a thrill, you’ve got such a good attitude
And though I enjoy my solitude
I’m gettin wise to what the power of two can do
Real love always takes it’s victim by surprise
Sneak attack devotion when I look into that black man’s eyes
Secrets of the cosmos realign in my spine; it’s truly ancient
Deep inside of me he’s the only one I ever need
Got no rhythm rhyme and reason in my knees
Senseless sets me free and plants my feet
into a different state of being
Simply a joy to be close to you
Such a thrill, you’ve got such a good attitude
And though I enjoy my solitude
I’m gettin wise to what the power of two can do
Real love always takes it’s victim by surprise
Sneak attack devotion when I look into that black man’s eyes
Secrets of the cosmos realign in my spine; it’s truly ancient
Deep inside of me he’s the only one I ever need
Got no rhythm rhyme and reason in my knees
Senseless sets me free and plants my feet
into a different state of being

[Jonte Short]
I’ll wait once, I can’t wait twice
When you get back, better treat me right
I don’t need cash, but since you asked
While you with me, where you should be

[Chorus 2X: Jonte Short]
When you get out of jail, I’ll be waiting
Honey, I sware, I’ll be there
When you get out of jail, just remember
On that day, we’ll be together

[Jonte Short]
You’ve done 18 months, got 18 more
That’s so much time, to wait for
So you’re not well, in the county hotel
But while you’re gone, I’ll hold on

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook: Jonte Short]
Yeah, baby, yeah...
Oooh... oooh, to make you believe, I’ve been missing you baby
Uh, and staying strong, everyday of the week, oh
Lately, I’ve been thinking about you
Uh, been way too long, and I’m losing sleep, oh...
Oooh.... yeah....
Oooh.... yeah....

[Jonte Short]
Your cold nights, will soon be warm
Cuz I’m gon’ keep ya, in my arms
Good loving, I’ve been keeping
When you get home, wont need no sleeping

[Chorus 4X]

[RZA]
Yo, back on the street, packing my heat
Put my sweep, in a broken down jeep
Bout to creep, on you cats who gave me one to three
Slip back to my residence (bodododo) count my dead presidents
That I hid in the safebox, a hundred miles from the evidence
It’s good to be home, pass the bone, boy the kid is back
Million dollar skate across town, ain’t no slinging that
If I get knocked and locked up, for five more years
My money and my honey, will still be there, word...

Verse 1: Kenny Austin

Straight uptown from money earnin’ Mow-Vee
I carry my tech nine, and troop with the YG’z
So when beef comes, I’m ready for war
I put a slug in my nigga and I settle the score
Like a tic for a tac, my gat bust the most caps
Killin’ muthafuckaz, Leave ‘em dead with the alley cats
You feel brave digga, Grave nigga, That’s where you goin’ fagat
Your bodies bein’ smothered with magats
Pump nigga shouldn’t act up, Don’t even floss ruff
I’ll beat you till you black as a cocoa puff
Muthafucka I’m as real as they come
Buckin’ muthafuckaz is a game we play for fun
Gettin’ wreck wit a tech, Shakin’ niggaz knecks
Blood drippin’ so bad from a cold kneck
What you figure when you livin’ by the trigger
That’s how it is when your fuckin’ wit a Street Nigga

Hook: Pete Rock and DJ Premier

Do or Die Nigga, Do or Die
Do or Die Nigga, Do or Die
Do or Die Nigga, Do or Die
Do or Die Nigga, Do or Die
(Repeat)

Verse 2: Tommy Guest

I’m a street nigga, You wanna know why
Cause I could give a fuck whether you or me die
Bitch ass niggaz better back up wit da quickness
Play me the wrong way, I’ll kill you like a sickness
Street Nigga to the baddest, My pants is saggin’
I’m down to catch a midnight Dragon
Jus coolin’ on the block so my glock’ll pop
More niggaz in the head, Even fuckin’ *cops*
I got soldiers, .45 pistol holders
Stick up kids, and some doin’ state biz
But fuck that, back to the subject
34th street, The whole fuckin’ YGz
Get fast doe, Fuckin’ wit mud hoes
Damn the Principle of my school, And his honor roles
I’ma street kid, So I got street smarts
Gettin’ my A’s and B’s while troopin’ on the sidewalk

Hook

Verse 3: Kenny Austin

Seperated on one side, So we can just smoke each other
Fuck a brother love for one another
I gotta survive,  Playin’ the street game
Splatter some fuckin’ brains, And sellin’ some cocaine
A savage rate, Indeed harsh
Hustle to get far, The devil got our minds all brain washed
So for Bates, Listen to the crackers and turf snakes
And all there are is coffee and cupcakes
He’s no longer a street nigga, But a confined nigga
Sittin’ in a cell doin’ time nigga
Rich fucks don’t realize, Packed and civilized
I’d love to see the tears in Trump’s eyes
When his mother was mugged, Shit was bugged
And he thought it would be me speakin’ to the judge
But he was wrong it was one of his own kind
A street nigga ain’t hard to find

Let me see your hands in the air
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ohhhh

[Miley Cyrus]
I remember dreamin ‘bout, the things I do right now
Like I climbed onto a cloud, scared to look back down
I remember when, I was all alone, nobody ‘round, to hold me down
But now you’re here with me tonight, look at what you found
I was lonely, for some time
Now it’s only, you and I
I won’t leave with-out your love
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I’m dancing, to the sound
Of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the airrrrr
Yeahhhh yeahhhh yeahhhhh
Let me see your hands in the airrrrr
Yeahhhh yeahhhh yeahhhhh
Let me see your hands in the air

[Ludacris]
It’s go hard or go home and it ain’t no lookin back
My toughest enemy’s in the mirror, would you look at that?
I’m Top 5 dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme
And if I ever take a seat I stood the test of time
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on, better know that I abused it
If I die before my time I’ll still be livin through my music
I cracked the industry open but still got this shit on lock
Even on the highway up to Heaven, Luda STILL will be on top
HEY!

[Chorus: Jesse West (True Love Everlasting)]
What’s your name, son? (I’m True Love Everlasting)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m God)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[True Love Everlasting]
Now the Gods walk the streets, the same as the next man
We say "Peace", and give niggas pound and spark land
We see the overall picture, and rush to make plans
While you put your life right, into the next man hand
Survival of the fittest, mad ghetto, hard hitters
New York City’s finest, greatest rhyme spitters
When it come to this game of life, they all beginning
Playing in the game of death, they all winners
Them niggas start selling they ass to eat dinners
They don’t care, they going all out, they all sinners
I guess they said ‘fuck it’, once the Devil jumped in us
We can let his ass do what he want, until he finished
The Gods give us gas to, when we have to
But we don’t put that, on every track, that we rap to
We could still build and spark L’s, when we come back, dude
But if you sling shots, we sling ‘em right back at you

[Chorus: Jesse West (RZA)]
What’s your name, son? (Eighteen, Twenty-six, One)
Are you a thug or a God? (God Cypher Divine)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[RZA]
Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah, never reneggin’
Don’t fuck with the dead pigeons or pigskin
You fuckin’ fake, 85 percent snake
Derelict ass bitch, you dead weight
Ain’t no fire escape in hell, every devil ain’t pale
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds"
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I’m hurlin’ ya’ll
Lightin’ bolts, by writin’ quotes
Strikin’ jolts that frightenin’ adults
From A to Zig-Zag, you get smacked, bitch, thrown into a shitbag
Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some fake thug
Drunk from the drink and gassed up by the drug
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis
While the Gods rebuildin’ Jerusalem, living inside golden palaces

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son? (Jess West from the beam)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m G-O-D, son)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so (true that)
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[Jesse West]
Now when I drop degrees, 85 percent freeze
I bomb ‘em with no problem, when they ease up
I squeeze off, I represent for O.G.’s
Who lay up in the cut, save that, roll trees
Used to flip bricks, and shit, sold d’s
Did a bid, came home, switched my whole steeze
I’m only in the game, to win more cheese
And you thugs who ain’t show me no love, can hold these
My game Trump tight like Biggie and Lil’ Cease
I reign on MC’s like Wu-Tang Killa Beez
I got peeps that hold heaters, cuz they need that
And ain’t scared to roll either, thinking something sweeter
Cats roll up, they say West, is you the hardest?
I say "Do Method Man know where the buddha spot is?"
Do 24/7 get paid regardless?
They try hard but couldn’t stop it, when we dropped this

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son?
Are you a thug or a God?
Peace, son
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

But bring your pistol and a dutch and burn a jay with the kid
See where we going its love but niggas get chopped up 
When problems pop up, they lighting the block up
See real niggas dying and the rest getting locked up 
Find yourself in some shit like your toilet done stopped up
But me I gotta plan to catch a bird in the hand 
And stash money in the bush while I’m cheifing on the kush
I need a couple hunnit grand to cop a lil land 
And all the records that I push gone make you pussies douche

You see I move in small circles and encompass the globe 
‘Bout to make money a weapon, plus I’m bout to reload
The other side side of love life is what I got to expose 
I’m tryna unfold your fabric and fill it with holes
Got the mind state of a menace, I’ll murder ya shows 
Floss hard without rhyming bout rims or clothes 
That’s a given, given a rhythm I’m a kill it with flows 
Then bring back to life with my murderous prose
See I’m a... rapper a man a gee when I gotta be 
Tryna find some harmony with this monster inside of me
Money made me a mad man, music made me a prodigy 
Struggle made me strong and I’m armed without apology
If its not about progress you need to quit...

Verse 3

You see my life is composed of good books and cartoons 
Cocaine in the closet and cash in the storeroom
A killer smile lying eyes a tatt and some war wounds
A bid two kids and a road to fortune
See in my mind I was born in a different time 
Where snitching will get you killed and cowardice is a crime
Original was original , that’s what made you a criminal 
The world was only a problem until you flip what its given you
And you aint got to take it, but you got to make it 
Its only a cycle til the day you decide to break it
But that aint telling you nothing the truth remains naked 
Real recognize real always will so you cant fake it
And I’m the most hated, but I don’t give a shit 
And don’t carry on about cause I’m livin’ it 
And I aint asking you for nothing while I’m getting it 
And I don’t give a fuck about your puzzle if I don’t fit in it !!

Growin up in Flint, I went to Gundry Elementary
A Little fat kid who ain’t have shit, lived on Lorado Street
Don’t get me wrong, cause we was far from po’ though
But up-to-date tennis shoes was far from affordable
A runaway, well, that describes me best
Cause if things ain’t go my way, it was time to jet
I ran back and forth from my mom’s to my pop’s house
And by the 9th grade I was a high school drop-out
15 and my life done went bad
By this time I was livin with my dad
Not thinkin ‘bout what’s goin on in life
And if I have to carry a gun or a knife
Will I have to use it, if so, then it’s on
I never had a girlfriend to call my own
So what I’m seein now I’m really hopin it’ll last
But if not - hah, I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past

Now my old man, yo, he doesn’t say much
He works every day and fiddle-faddle with his truck
And when I went to school he was home in the bed
But when I came home, he was up gettin fed
Now people, don’t trip, see, my pops never hang
But I can tell you this: that he is up on the game
Seven in the morning, I’m dressed in my Levis
Headed for school with my nigga, my nerve, T-Ray
Reached into the room and got my dollar off the dresser
Knowin when I get to school I get ganked for the rest of it
Huh, I saw an apple on the table, had to get me one
Threw on my Crew hat, the first kid in Flint with one
Me and T-Ray walkin up Dupont
All I’m thinkin about is skippin, that’s what I’ll probably do
But it really don’t matter, nowadays it won’t last
I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain’t much too worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
(I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past)
I ain’t much too worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past

[ VERSE 3 ]
So now I got a baby and a baby on the way
As long as me and both of the moms are cool, I’ll never have to pay
It’s not what I bargained for, but it’s what I’ve bought
And if I have to pay child support, I’d be my fault
But I ain’t the type to get uptight and fighting things
I’m tryin to be like Spike and ‘do the right thing’
I’m never ridin dirty nor negotiatin kilos
Me and Pop Breed and Al Capone, we ride in trio
Coolin in the Cherokee, them girls hollerin "Eric Breed"
Puffin up on the dank, cause I ain’t messin with no generic weed
I’m in the world, I’m tryin to make a livin, son
We need money, and ain’t nobody givin none
My own boss, I’m workin at my j-o-b
No more kids and no more women playin me
And as long as I keep my mind on straight, I’m gon’ last
I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain’t much too worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried
Worried about the past
(Huh, nah...)
Ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
(I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past)
I ain’t much too worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
(I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past)

[ Night & Day continue in the background until end ]

[ OUTRO: MC Breed ]
Past tense...
I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense...
I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
Yo
You still gon’ listen to this song
In ‘93?
In ‘94?
In ‘95...
I’ll have somethin new
But right now I want you to enjoy this
Cause in ‘95 - believe me
Your boy Breed, I ain’t too much worried ‘bout the past
I’m outta here

"The door is closing"

[Rhymefest]
Yeah man
I finally got e’rything together I’m ready to go
Got my passport, my intinerary, it’s about to be on

"Jefferson Park is next"
"Doors open on the left, at Jefferson Park"

(You got a trip planned? Where you goin Che?)
What do you mean, where I’m goin?
And how you know my name, fool? I don’t know you
(Ready to talk to us?)
Am I ready to talk to you?
Awwwww, I know who you are, I know what y’all on
Listen man, I’ma get on this plane
And when I’m outta here, ain’t nuttin y’all can do about it
and HELL NAW I ain’t talkin to you~!
Whatever book you got open, you might as well shut it
I’M OUT~!
(Alright see you at your next stop Che)

[Rhymefest]
{*breathing hard*} I think I lost him
Aight look, this is revolution
The new era, of freedom fighters
Most governments call terror
I live by the gun, they march and write letters
Born in Argentina, Ernesto Guevera
Some people knew him as El Commandente
Mexicans said, "Che mucho mucho hombre!"
Enemies knew I was good with the gunplay
But today, I’m, I’m, El, Che!
Yeah, that’s my name
Communist shit’s all the same
We was born in the hood where we stood slingin lots of ‘caine
In the drought ask God for rain
What it’s ‘bout when you fin’ to lose your house and yo’ spouse and say
You diggin in the couch for change
You wanna blow out your brains, everybody need a hero
What’s my name, what’s my name?
I’m El, Che...

A fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom
The smell of decent is I
I am standing for the truth
Too long has been denied
The data of changing is rising
I hope we realize
Unchained wings let angels fly

[Chorus]
I see hemp fields forever
Growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in our breeze
I see hemp fields forever growing wild and free
Wild and free

A crime against nations
A war is waged there is a message
In the wind for every race
Peace and love we saw
So let us grow is good for the body
Is good for the soul

[Chorus]

So lost the kiss of death
Deny the tree of life
Stand hypocrisy for so many lies
Corporation greed can only see small farmers survive by planting weed

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Crucified savior to save your face
Demonized nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use
What the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree herbs of the fields

[Chorus]

Question: when’s the last time you touched essence?
Reflect it, 3 minutes and some seconds
Who these rap cats you repping?
With stars in they flag?
When’s the last time you checked it?
Me? I go switch your poetic perspective
Rim to pimp brims with electric chair Texas
Nigger touched up like perms for perfection
Permanent damage don’t dance on my records
Have sex and more babies
Beau young and restless
Protest mine cos I rolled a death sentence
Resurrect epics with stars suns and crescents
7’s with circles broke into 4 sections, yeah
That’s ahead of most heads who don’t listen
Mafia children alive with tradition
Fingers have visions
Every song scriptured, it’s simply a seance
But not ghost written! Ah ...
Azeem is ill man, listen
Kick it with strippers and thieves like the first christians
The prince - ya’ll amateurs, you can’t do this
Throw a box of records at the block, they’d still miss
I shift focus, quote my ribs
Still hungry, no jokes where the cheekbones is
The speed changes sequence my beats got fists
Raised on tough titties naw we don’t snitch!
My mind’s a neighbourhood and rhymes paint pictures
Of castles and riches and statues of sisters
Tall story buildings: it’s a nice place to visit
Don’t record it to my cut-throat district, come on.

Refrain

This is a space opera, Chakra shocker
Black anthrax, a style monster
A proud sponsor, strapped back with armour
Peace -   I harvest words, I’m a farmer
10 more steps ahead we move forward
Dog I’m organised like Black August
Songs are fortified, we all lawless
I’ll see 45 before charges
If this is just my time, I can’t call it
Go out with half the squad and plus the sergeant
Living like a million years of promise
Calmly cause a riot - keep performing
Warning - this is noise and plus poison
Avoiding the rapture, relax and enjoy it
Annoying the toy in you, that’s what the point is
Life’s a bitch tough tits but enjoy it, come on!

Refrain

I’m a Saint - why?
Cos I paint lines
Make pages cry when the ink dries
Straight before your eyes I create lines
Fame beyond the name of the grapevine
Plain and simple pain so we kill time
With stranger took cocaine but I will lie
This is not a game it’s a real crime
A freak of nature thing that I still shine
Specific - compare me to who? That’s a sickness
They wrists too thin for this
They won’t risk it
I throw fits and vocal mission district
Rich in non-fiction, god’s most gifted
Pull out your microchip you’re shit’s glitching
Music (drug-induced) causes visions
Beats that Zeph produced, you’re just tripping
Turn up the music fool and quit bitching!

Deep beneath the southern skies, and watch me win a million eyes - 2x

[Apani]
Yo, what you think you doin’ nigga
Nigga where you think you goin
Nigga watch your place, acting like you’re not knowin
Showin’ your ass, nigga show me your teeth
Bisk and showin’ your scars deep
Three fifths of man versus poppa large, who’s in charge
Can’t bargain, can’t win, I’m in the zone to
Plot to your kind of kin
We blend to bite the bottom
Share proper shacks
After monks n’ cotton
People forgotten, fuck ‘em
Bad luck sucks
Black bucks will be more bucks
For Daddy Warbucks, and stuck-up society whores
Shake my family tree down to the core
Even more is hidden,
Forbidden to your eyes and mind
More lies fashioned for the un-wise
Nothin’ surprise me no more
I be surprised if shit changed
I’d fun fast and far if I could escape this cage
Can’t contain my rage
Guess that’s why they keep me locked
Keep me livin’ hand to mouth, hustlin’ for what I got
If I drop a crumb, here come the vultures
All I really got that’s mine, is my pride and culture
What ch’all want that too?
Wouldn’t you hate me, if I was you?
Wouldn’t you want me dead
Take a minute, let that sink into your head
You call me enemy, my blood’s red
I’m flesh and bones, too human like you
Can I live, sayin’ really (I’m sayin’)

Deep beneath the southern skies, and watch me win a million eyes \xc2\x96 2x

[Apani]
I stood up to be counted,
You beat me down surrounded by your million eyes
My bones cracked, it sounded like Hell’s thunder
Under attack, arms pinned back
Blurry vision, bloody, can’t see who first stuck me
Between my thighs, I felt ugly
They took turns to fuck me
Beneath southern skies, they want to shame me
Make me think I’m nothin
But I’m still every woman, plus
Won’t give them the satisfaction, of reaction
These bastards will have to kill me
Spill my blood on the roots of this willow tree
While strange fruits swings off the limbs of plenty
If that be G-d’s will, then so it is
I’d rather die in birth, than raise his kids
I leave this black hole with my soul intact
Never looked back, now once he put his tongue in my mouth
I’m a spit on his fronts, never give in
Gotta go, I’ll scrap him even if I can’t win, (what)

Deep beneath the southern skies, and watch me win a million eyes \xc2\x96 2x

Hey love

[ VERSE 1 ]
Females are shady as they wanna be (wanna be)
Out for the cheese, but they wanna beef
Slidin to the side, but you can’t see over me
We gon’ keep it real, to the glass, let the Mo\xc3\xabt spill
How you feel, is you wantin me? (ah-ah)
Well, money shady, make a lady act ficticiously
That’s why I love it, baby can’t get close to me
I built a gate, hawk-eye the game closely
That’s why I’m straight, what these thugs thinkin of
Tryin to split me and my love
We gon’ flow like a dove sack to hit em back
Cause I saw it, hummin, comin at me
These fools bustin and it’s comin rapidly
Don’t you know me, homie? I’m about what you about
Peep, creep while you sleep, clean your whole stash out
20 g’s all dubs, player, what you got
Smokin hay with my love, keep spendin, won’t stop

[ CHORUS ]
Hey love
May I have a word with you
I lied to you, yeah
Guess what I been going through

[ VERSE 2 ]
I used to think you love everything I stood about
Never once did you doubt the fact I’ll make it out
This ghetto, push a Benz, D Troop, Wayne and Twins
Bust a broad, call a friend, it’s off the heezy once again
Let em never come between us, never take us to the cleaners
Steady dippin out the backdo’ with Funky Cold Medina
I seen it in her eyes, analyze, play the game too
Don’t be sloppy, boo, or I be droppin you
Off at your mama’s house, no Jerry Springer bout
Cause that’s the felony, that’s what they tellin me
And it’s my word like a spelling, bee
I rather see Pam Grier round here, Foxy Brown with me
Except you stay around, lie, clown, die with me
Split the pie 50/50 eye to eye with me
That’s on the game, mack gotta be
The best on the west, start a worldwide lottery

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
How many women out here want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a ‘I do’, but you’re ‘I maybe’s
Baby, I want a fly lady, 5-Mercedes
Body lookin damn good, still drive me crazy
The kind that like the ice watch cause it freeze time
Don’t ask the price on that cause I gees mine
I’m a city slicker from a slicker city
Baby from the country, so she brick-buildin titty
I’m on the West coast, so I’m one of those boys
To match up the preacher daughter with the homeboy
How many women out there want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a ‘I do’, but you’re ‘I maybe’s

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

[Intro]
Yeah, bounce to this
Yeah, bounce, uh
Shake ya titties, mom, yeah
Come on, one love, for the shorties
Outta Browns, son, nigga right now
Chicks, go get me a drink
Eyein’ a nigga right now
Let’s go over there, who pop on that side?

[Hook 2X]
Razah, Zah, Zah, Zah
Ra, Zah, Zah

[Hell Razah]
She like rocks like The Flintstones
Hit chicks in all skin tones
Young chicks can’t wait to get bonned
I’m like the floor you get slip on
I love my dunns when they clips long
Max Julian, son, that ain’t gangsta
We smack niggaz outta anger, shit
Get locked up, turn spoons into bangers
What, hit the chick, got her givin’ me money
Rubbin’ in my cuffshots, all over her tummy
She like Iceberg, the champagne
We outta raise a Razah campaign
She don’t get a damn thing
Not a cow, who here, dollars bill and shit
Still lay up in the lab eatin’ mills and shit
Got these industry niggaz talkin’ deals and chips
A&R;’s losin’ jobs when they hear my shit
I roll my weed up and whips don’t spill the shit
The same way we came in ships, we leave in ships
My niggaz got g’s to get, and squeeze the clips
Ain’t no hustlin’ for petty crumbs, weed and kicks

[Chorus]
Yeah, who that nigga they ain’t fuckin’ wit
Spit wisdom deep shit, rock fly shit
Only fuck wit real niggaz on the field, nigga
Hell Razah, Child of Israel, niggaz can’t fuck with him
They better duck from him, don’t fuck with him

[Hell Razah]
I’m Max Julien, the millionaire mind inside a hooligan
The wise one out the foolish men
And trust go the god, when you really find out whose ya friends
I stay droppin’ jewels and gems, and coops and timbs
A marksmen sharpshooter when I use the pen
Sittin’ on twenty inch rims, cadillac in
New York if you like it or not, it’s what’s crackin’
Shorties on the Greyhound bus, is what’s crackin’
Hoes only made for those who stay mackin’
Clubs only made for those who stay stackin’
Got everything from Phat Farm to Brickface jackets
My forty-four eleven take you ace step stackin’
Never come to BK, chained and ring flashin’
Niggaz will take ya shit is what’s crackin’
High off the hydro-weed and thug passion
Chicks swallow ecstasy but love action
When Razah get signed, that’s it, it’s closed caskets
Ya little bastards

[Hook to end]

[Outro]
Take that, muthafuckin’, fake ass
Soundin’ like other niggaz ass niggaz
Muthafuckas ain’t even got their own look
Muthafuckas trynna act like they gangstas
Ya niggaz better do the knowledge man
Fuckin’ lost muthafuckas
Yeah, get the knowledge, get the knowledge
The project prophet, show ya niggaz the other shit
Take the muthafuckin doo-rags off
Ya ain’t thugs, you get locked up
Ya niggaz be tellin’ on them, who do ya love
And them shorties ya got, ya bout to get that up
G.G.O’s is in this bitch, G.G.O.’s is in this bitch
They leavin’ wit us, and don’t hate, what

Sad Boys, 2002
Unknown Death, 2001

[Chorus]
The ocean’s where they’ll find you
The ocean’s where they’ll find you
You can find me if you look in your mind too
The ocean’s where they’ll find you
The ocean’s where they’ll find you
You can find me if you look in your mind too
I’ma, I’ma get a chopper, I’ma, get a chopper
Shoot that ho in the face before she try to stop ya’
Yung Lean, so fucking proper
Sad Boys, we own choppers
Put her in that body bag, the ocean’s where I’ll drop her

Eat her out, wipe my face with a serviette
Rich, feeling legs
Creeping in the cut, with a Tommy gun
I’ma stomp on your fondue
Face looking like Scooby Doo, the groovy one
Cannibus, anthrax, paid fast, get stacks
Count racks, cash checks, and all that
Bad breath, LSD right, creeping ‘round like a lab rat
Eat her out, kit kat
Shorty we can take it real slow, if you wanna
Sex and pills, Lean got the marijuana
I got so much ice, and these ice creams cost one hunna’
You know we gon make it hot, like the summer
Shorty she a runner, me so smart, and I can buy you drinks
I got money like Obama, Internet Explorer
Boys, bitch, we dumb, dumber
Hit that cut up, fire shots, make you run up
Hit that club up, fire shots, make you run up

[Chorus]

Lean slice it up
BBC, straight, finna bust a nut
Sad Boys in the place, lock your daughters up
Smoking these greens, killing these fiends
? with some fucking baked greens
Little chain explosive, I’m fast, I’m C-4
Wake up in the morning and I’m married to a dinosaur
Her vagina’s sore
Click clack click like the liquor store
Living life like we in Baltimore
Tell the preacher it’s a folklore
What, for? What, for?
Switched out the Ferrari from the double door
Smoking Sherman like I’m Dumbledore
Humble, poor
Hungry hippos and we finna rob the liquor store
And we finna rob the liquor store
Lean got plenty more

Sad Boys, we done opened the door
Sad Boys smoking plenty dro
Shouts out to Gregar

[Stro]
Come on, 2..1
Yeah, Haha.. checkit out y’all... yo
Ohmega Watts in the place y’all
Lightheaded, Stro is up in the place y’all
Procussions..yeah
Colorado... Portland
Keep this recording

[Stro]
I was born a soul child, learned to walk on the bap-beat
Runnin’ on a multi-track meat, but I’m no athlete
The wax seems like a career, the piece of the puzzle that brought me here
I’ve been diggin for years!
To find the rhythm combined with good feelings
Revolution per minute 45, to 33 and the 3rd
Up to now, everything that I’ve heard
I could easily describe a word (uh-ha)
I’m standin in the shower, dust up to the roof
I guess sometimes you gotta get dirty to find the truth
And the proof is in this record i’m holdin
A blank white label, deep ?? of golden
I put it on slipmat, and act as a spiritual God
The headnod, provoked by the spirit inside
Can’t leave ‘em behind, it’s always at the front of my crate
You got soul then I know all of y’all can relate
For real

[Ohmega Watts]
I found a key, now searchin for a relax ya fix
Maybe a treasure chest, filled with ?? of gifts
Like.. When I.. dig in the crates to find breaks
And samples that inspire me to reshape and create
A new form of sound (Yeah!) usin my machines and tools
But got soul that stand out among a circle of fools
Who chase, ?? tresures and quick highs
From the heart I speak truth and thats no lie
So! Back to the program, i’m my own man
Shape by gods hands, unique design under the wine
To pleasure in my existence, for instance
?? styles, so each find life, to spot a sentence of death
And i’ve come to find there’s more to life then just livin givin
I’ve seen signs of wonders and received the new beginning
To all you out searchin for that life treasure
The evidence is more closer than ever
.........And thats the find

[Chorus]
I’m searchin’, for my soul in here
Creating somethin new from older heads
Gimme the light, and let it shine
Then press rewind, we all lookin for something to find
(Ohmega)
Hey yo Stro, I found it, a rhythm to break through
(Stro)
Hey yo Ohmega, I found it, a song to save you

Keep on searchin’
Keep on searchin
‘Till we find that something to find

[Stro]
We go inside, with the spirit divine
Out to find those with similar minds
That all starts with a ??, to brush on, even with dust on
Ohmega Watts, tell ‘em how we do this production

[Ohmega Watts]
With a little touch of jazz and the styles to match
Were a class a act, to good times, we bringin it back
To when it was fresh to say ‘def’
Now 80’s were a mess, but MC’s ‘spose to make ‘em ‘yes yes’

[Stro]
I take seven 12 inches, put ‘em in the line
And get seven more records, thats hard to find

[Ohmega Watts]
I do a bit of the same, and though quiet is kept
I do it for the love, and not just to get a rep

[Stro]
And that’s cool, my man, it’s all a part of the plan

[Ohmega Watts]
Find the source of inspiration so united we stand

[Stro]
Back to back

[Ohmega Watts]
Side to side

[Both]
Soon we all will see
We be the Awesome 2, most definatly

[Chorus]
I’m searchin’, for my soul in here
Creating somethin new from older heads
Gimme the light, and let it shine
Then press rewind, we all lookin for something to find
(Ohmega)
Hey yo Stro, I found it, a rhythm to break through
(Stro)
Hey yo Ohmega, I found it, a song to save you

Keep on searchin’
Keep on searchin
‘Till we find that something to find

\t(It is indeed a pleasure
\tTo see so many Nubian faces
\tSo many original faces here tonight)

[ Jaz ]\tHey yo, what’s up, Jay Zee?
[ Jay ]\tYo, what’s up, Jaz?
[ Jaz ]\tAin’t nothin
\tJust chillin, you know
\tA lotta fronters out there perpetratin
\tTryin to rock a old trippin style
\tYouknowmsayin?
[ Jay ]\tWe have none of that, alright?
\tOriginators is here
[ Jaz ]\tWord up
\tLet me kick a little somethin
[ Jay ]\tWord up
[ Jaz ]\tGuess you’ll tune in later, right?
[ Jay ]\tYeah, but won’t you
\tKick, kick, kick it

[ VERSE 1: The Jaz ]
My rhymin and singin technique is applaudable
Livin in luxury, and it’s affordable
No other brother is better than me, the J, the a, the z
The cream of the crop, and the top of the top
The suckers are tryin to stop
The biggeda-, the biggeda-, the boss of the hip-hop
Hop, they’ll never come near
They’ll never come here, no, not this year
They’re growin in fear, I’m very sincere, I will jerk tears
Operator pushin the data, I’m talkin bout info
And check it, you’re still stumblin and bumblin off the intro
So take it a step at a time, this dope rhyme
Be makin a note that it’s refined by a skilled mind
This is a warning for biters
Stealers and robbers and sucker reciters
Call it a night, and before you roam
Don’t try this at home
The style that I’m usin, I’m here to abuse
The garbage and junk I refuse
Divy it up, cause I’m here to collect my dues from all of yous
This ain’t no cartoon drama caper, pass the paper
Your mind’s in a daze, higher than a skyscraper
I’m teachin and reachin and preachin
And showin and flowin and growin and blowin
The rest of the best right out of the box
I shoot the funky sweat socks
I obliterate and I devastate
You wanna go head to head
Rhymin until you fall dead?
Great, make it a date
Never a conflict or a debate, you’re callin me sir, see
You sucker, you fucker, you pussy, you wussy, nobody can verse me
The Jaz is pushin the power
You two-bucks-an-hour
Unable, mentally unstable, to me you cower
You never can write a dope lyric to have an effect just like this did
To be at the peak in the field of hip-hop, you only wish, kid
And Jiggeda-Jay Zee, yo, yo, my partner
G-g-g-get on the mic, and cold start to

[ VERSE 2: Jay Zee ]
Wreckin and wreckin in seconds less than speeds of light
So the miggeda-more that come, the miggeda-merrier, right, right
Excitin the mic much to the delight of millions of Nubians
And Amorites just can’t understand the groove we’re in
Cool, it might take a couple of takes for you to clarify
Don’t lie, you coulda never got in on the first try
But never to worry, I’m not in a hurry, take your time
Cause it’s my rhyme, I siggeda-said so, and I’m J-a-y-Z, y’all know me
I wish you co-write, cause you’d pay me all the rhymes you stole from me
Leave you freeze in a minute, you gotta get in it breathin
Only when it lets, no sweat, I stutter-step with ease, and
Stop fakin, you’re makin it, son
I’m breakin and breakin and breakin your tongue
Don’t get caught perpetratin the cool ones
Figure we’re bigger and badder and better, and baby, let’s face it
We bring havoc, flowin faster than rabbits, try to race it
The lyrical miracle writer, flippin until it drives you
Crazy, seek spiritual help from Jaz and Jay Zee
Standin in awe, you saw the best of em all, the rest will fall
Requestin for more, jaws stuck on the floor
These lyrics I pour, we saw, because we’re greater
And we are the thiggida-thiggida-thiggida-the (the) originators
Word

\t(Cure the blackman
\tAnd bring him back to the way he was
\tIn his original state)

\t(Asalaam alaikum)  (4x)

\t(To give power to the right to overcome bliss)
\t
\t(It is indeed a pleasure
\tTo see so many Nubian faces
\tSo original faces here tonight)

\t(Asalaam alaikum)
\t
\t(To give power to the right to overcome bliss)

\tAsalaam alaikum)

Let’s get it on get it on get it on

[Chorus]
I’m still here (3X)

[Lil Menace]
Mija you must have put a spell on my mind
Come give me some of your time damn your fine
And your kisses taste like wine
Know I’m sitting here all alone reminiscing
About the times we shared
The love we had and know I’m missing
Cause you’re the only one that had that part of me
Yes the key to my heart
I was your potion you were my recipe
I miss you baby I’m waiting for you to come back
You appear like a mirage everyday it makes me sad
Because I reach out for you but you’re just a vision
Like an angel coming from heaven
To get with you was a mission
But I know now that I’m with you again
There’s no time to be friends because I promise I’ll be there till the end

[Chorus]
I’m still here (3X)

[Ese Deli]
After so many years when you think I would go
I don’t need to say I love you cause you already know
The time we spent together was the best in my life
My expectation was only of you being my wife
I would kill and die for you you know what you mean to me
Something I never felt before is what you bring to me
My angelito chiquito my dulcecito
You were my mamacita I was your papacito
I could see your eyes looking and your smile that makes me crazy
I feel your hands touch me and your kisses that make me lazy
Everyday is a knew beginning you were my primavera
You are always on my mind 24/7 I swear ta
God how I miss ya damn how I need ya
You’re all inside of my body [hah]
 I even breathe ya but you’re not in front of me
So I could see if you ever come back you’ll know where I’ll be because

[Chorus]
I’m still here (3X)

[Lil Menace]
Mi amor ven aqui y dame un beso
Esto es amor por que lo siento en mi pecho
Un beso por un beso y nunca te dej\xc3\xb3
Sola con nadie por que eres mi angel del cielo
Diosito gracias por darme este regalo
La raz\xc3\xb3n por que estoy enamorado
Y mija te dije que nunca te iba a olvidar
Tu eres mi sol y ahora tengo que trabajar
Para tu coraz\xc3\xb3n que tienes por dentro
Vamos a estar juntos por vida o hasta que yo me muera

[Chorus]
I’m still here (3X)

[Lil Flip] 
I might be in a drop top Jag
Girl I’m a thug I’ma let my pants sag
Ride on chrome all day
This what we do down here where I stay
Diamonds in yo face look in my piece
You aint seen shit girl look in my teeth
I’m gon shine like stars
You aint never seen cars like ours
We spend cash, roll on 3’s
I spend money like it grow on trees
I’m Lil Flip, and I ball
Me, Red, Hum, AP, and Boss Hawg
Sucka free and Dime Records got stacks
Bubbled-eyed Benzos and Cadillacs
We all ball for the millenium
I’m filthy rich and I aint even 21
 
Hook
[Tow Down] What them boys gotta do ride on 20 inch chrome
[Lil Flip] Burn up in the candy Benz, leave the Lexus at home
[Tow Down] You boys might be glowin’
[Lil Flip] When I open my mouth
[Tow Down] You see nothin but precious cuts 
[Lil Flip] In the Dirty South
(repeat 2 times)
[Lil Flip] Coz we shinin
[Tow Down] Say what?
[Lil Flip] Livin our life like stars
[Tow Down] We some g’s blowin trees in our foreign cars
 
[Tow Down] 
As I skate down ya block, big body on blades
Don’t hate, white on white, put it out Escalade
Blowin trees, TVs, green, CDs, and DVDs
I’m high but lo-key, ridin SUVs
The boy wonder, the block burner, the blade runner
The street stunner, the head turner like Ted Turner
High-dollar baller keepin the ‘dro in stock
I hit the spot, drop the top and I pop the crop 
You know the name, top billin and chillin
White boy in your hood, and I’m makin a killin
Rhymin and stealin, I’m shipping a million
Gone go platinum so now the South got a villain
Story told
In a time of need, money sex and weed
Rhyme time for Dime, power, profit, and poetry
Ride four V-12, B-1 Pirelli steel
Retracting the dome like Enron field
How ya feel?
 
[Lil Flash]
Bashin in UFO
Automatic 2-4
In the 21st century stop handcuffin hoes
When I open my mouth, watch the crystals blind
It helps ya learn every word when I speak my rhyme
Up the block I climb scream stall and shine
Burn off in candy Benz and leave the Lexus behind
Starched jeans, polo shirts, on a quest like Johnny
Boss Hawg affiliated so you cant outgrind me
Customized, bubble-eyes, to the starchiest ties
Cartier I wear no its not a disguise
Southern stars been ridin on 20 inch chrome
They’ll be shinin like sun through the top of the dome
They call me Lil Flash playa coz I’m settin it off
I’m a shinin star from the Dirty South
Lil Flash, and Kwee, popped up on 3
2000 shinin hard for the world to see

Man, I did it again
I created when I mated with a pad and a pen
I’m getting involved with the solvin’-problems we in
Building a city with community, children and friends
Somebody said that "we can give."  I wish some help from all them
They Make it bubble like before we get in trouble again
They make it hard when you get out that’s why you back in the pen
Man it’s a system where the plan for every young black man is thick and thin
 
Part-times hood-rhymes make amends
They makin’ us look like we all beasts without a means to pretend
Like what we been through ain’t a struggle enough
We do it ruff and tuff, up in the city steady killin’ our fuss
We fillin’a organize, just a simple plan in demand
We put it into action and lend ourselves a hand
For the movement improvement at a glance
Soap-boxin’ on a block  I’m speakin’ thoughts
Think about it my friends...
 
Doin’ it, like gettin’ up-n’-at-’em
Whether you on some 9 to 5 job-shit, or simply makin’ magic
Like writin’ real-live spit that happen
Rappin’ whatever we needed to hear, let’s make it clear
Like what’chu do, and what’chu doin’ it for?
You on the grind for your own climb. well see, that ain’t survivin’ no more
Cause this here, we got a village with chores, so we could eat
Teach these kids about they legacy, Put shoes on they feet
Walk the path and not get stuck on these streets
We bled for most, so at least, Let’s take note of grandma’s family trees
The roots run deep, and it try’s wide
We can’t get brock up by the blocks, they box us and outside
They outline us when we lay to rest
Shouldn’t be on some pavement and sidewalk, perpetratin’ the stress
I guess they makin’ us a project t test
How to remove the planet those who naturally blessed
But I bet, we wouldn’t let it, less the answer was yes
And I met some freedom fighters takin’ shit off they chest
And the rest, these motherfuckers need to listen and learn
Get with the vision, ‘cause the world still turns

Yeah
Word up
Niggas is out there frontin
Tryin to get the fame
Niggas need to be gettin the money

[ Ja Rule ]
Don’t risk it, Ja Rule’s known for makin fat shit
Fully-loaded clip, usin wax for targets
Rattattat, rewind the DAT, black
I got your mind wide open and your wig pushed back
So keep it comin, you don’t want none, but you’ll get some
Sweatin faggot niggas, got that ass full of cum
Ja live, leavin flatlines through your vital signs
When in disguise I’m a shadow with red eyes
I stay high, layin in the bed, do or die
A stye over my eye made me realize
Life’s a scramble with scars and scrapes
You better premeditate for the moves and shake
Cause it’s a shakedown, watch me break down on the low
The real is that them fake niggas can’t flow
You get moved on and get that ass torn
Out the frame, muthafuckas
For tryin to bring the ruckus

[ CHORUS ]
Get the fortune, muthafuck the fame
Maintain but never strain flow with the grain

[ Nemesis ]
52 pick-up’s
Oh my God, I shatter niggas, it’s a stick-up
Niggas got popped on the block, raise up
19 years young, I’m still wildin
Got more rhymes than combined time of niggas on the Island
So bring the wax, selector, we comin through your sector
Blasted off Tanqueray mixed with peach nectar
Niggas play the good son and I play the killer
Them niggas ??? cause the Click is much iller
[ Ja Rule ]
Who’s next to get they neck broke
Rubberneckin my mic-check, showin niggas no respect
Cause you’re chokin off the mic that I left smokin
Hopin that this shit you kick is this potent
Paraphernalia, illegal substance, don’t touch this
Parents be advised cause I’m explicit with my lyrics
On some real shit, fuck the bullshit, it’s the Click
Representin Woodhull, Hollis Ave., 205th

[ CHORUS ]

[ Ja Rule ]
I live and die for my Click, nigga, goin all out for the cause
Protect what’s mines and then I take what’s yours
During the day rap assassin
Keep MC’s off my heels from blastin muthafuckas into fractions
My actions gotta speak louder than words
I’m on the verge of becomin the first nigga that’s heard
A lifetime sentence, born and raised to be relentless
Black, get them niggas with a death wish
[ Chris Black ]
Niggas got me target, blazin mad slugs on a strap
Nem Terror, Ja Rule and Chris Black
3 deadly elements out for the fortune
Ave. cold be scorchin, 9mm storchin
[ Ja Rule ]
The way I choose to live my life is irrelevant
Smokin weed for the hell of it
With my Click, get the dick
You can’t fuck with the foundation
Mic G, CMC, a Top Dawg ??????

[ CHORUS ]

("Ladies and gentlemen
Tonight we have, the battle of the century")

[Chorus (x2)]
Round one (round one), round two (round two)
Round three (round three), battle me (battle me)

Yo, yo round one
Let me begin this, ring the bell
Complex like microchips processed like Intel
Melt mics to molten metal
Leave the whole city level, I’m a
Stomp on heads, plus
Murder the world
In this game I’m a make my move
I refuse to lose
I’m a strike that match and blow my fuse
I’m not amused
I leave mics bruised, battered, and abused
Take ya innocence, make ya feel used
M-I-double Z-A, Mizza wizard
Unpack ya backbone and shake ya gizzards
I’ll make ya whole body hurt as I slither through the woodwork
It’s not just my work, it’s the law of my universe
Now my verse for verse, chapter for chapter
Never ever ending hit, here there or after
I’m setting mics on fire as I shred your speech
It’s like part of a feat, battle me (battle me)

[Chorus (x2)]

Now my adrenaline’s pumping, I’m ready to throw down
One blow off round one and you’re stumbling around
We’ve approached round two and you hit the ground
By round three you’ll be TKO’ed, totally knocked out
I could handle twelve levels, in one round alone
I pack a lyrical chromosome, and a mic of platinum and chrome
Don’t dare call me Mizza call me, Mizza Messiah
I’m your, worst nightmare but your number one desire
Leave your mind wired, how many emcees remain
The lyrics I contain is enough to disconnect the brain
You thought your lyrics were heavy but they were light at the weigh in
Put my lyrics on a scale and it would say "overweighted"
Oh my gosh, can you imagine if I’m actually concentrating
I would know your next move before you do from what you’re thinking
I’m a make it in ‘em seas, from the Atlantic to the Pacific
I was at your level once but now I’ve finally mastered it
I rock this disastrous dangerousness
Put your tongue, in a twist
And heavily damage your esophagus
I’m leaving no witnesses, emcees are in the breeze
You’re having trouble standing, follow me to round three

[Chorus (x2)]

Now it’s, really my time
I’m ready to, blow like a missile
Melt your bone marrow and shatter your gristle
‘Cause the stage is my ring, the mic is my ref
And my ref says you need 20 sets to catch breath
Now you’re sweatin’, knees buckling
Ready for some suckling
Let me rock you to sleep, and tuck you in
‘Cause my one, my two, I’m breaking the rules
Leave you frustrated and confused like a Rubik’s cube
Now I’m running through, tearing down barricades
Avoid this renegade I’m like a runaway train
I’m the one to blame, for rocking mics in different places
Leaving no, physical traces, you cats hate it
My style’s so creative, melt a mic that’s gold plated
And the liquid taste stings and erase my concentration
So here’s a demonstration of the rhymes that I got
When my mic socket’s fifty degrees, made you hot

[Chorus (x2)]

("You’re a devious bastard")

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, House Gang, what the deal, family?
It’s been a long time comin’, long nines bustin’
Get the stack and all that, we gotta let ‘em know where we goin’ man
Cause we the future, ya dig?

[Inspectah Deck]
Ask around what’s fuckin’ with them
Live niggas stack G’s and believes keep a couple a spin
Know my team don’t front or pretend
Made men with control like Frank White, musclin’ in
Nah, ya’ll can’t run with the great
Throw my name on the scale
Son it’s king size holdin’ it’s weight
Got a taste for them donuts and cakes
Got wolves with they tongues out, droolin’ all over your plate
Keep a 4 or 5th long and a whip, if ya’ll wanna flip
In the kitchen stay ballin’ a fix
Boy you act like you strong in the pits
But up north, got your manhood took, right along with your kicks
Boy, you lived under the wing
Got robbed by the C.O.’s, Bloods, Crips, Gods and Kings
Ain’t neva seen the box in the bing
Find out it was PC, weak niggas rockin’ ya bling
I never said I’m Nino Brown, but for mine
For all means, cousin, I’mma squeeze those rounds
I lounge whether B low down, in the street with Street
Playin’ C-Lo, with c-notes down
Boy, Brown knows I played your role
Salute the Gene-ral, and don’t violate the code
My footsteps shake the ground
In my cypher, no snakes allowed
Cause your ways are foul, boy
You heard us comin’, didn’t make the sound
What, you gangsta now?

[Chorus: Carlton Fisk]
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we hungry in the jungle, don’t lose ya life
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
If you live by the gun, you might die by the knife
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we movin’ with a army, don’t loose your stripes
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we hustle everyday and night, like everything aight

[Donnie Cash]
Eyo, I’m stickin’ to the streets, I’m addicted to the streets
Violate D, nigga you be stickin’ to the streets
Head in the ground, I listen to the streets
Head in the crown, I’m here now, what was missin’ was me
But they ain’t want me all over the track
Said the flow too dope, leave a monkey all over your back
Now I pump it all over the Stat, if I ain’t holdin’ the mac
Then pump a dump and leave a hole in your back
I got the streets in my veins, the beef and the pain
Snowstorm, hail, sleet and the rain
Son I move the snow by the O, peep the piece and the chain
Reach, I put the piece to your frame
I’m sprayin’ ya’ll from deep, cause the aim
Y’all playin’ like the streets is a game (Animal Way Of Life)
And ya’ll hatin’, cause I’m capin’, always speakin’ my name
Cause I ride around shit and tore the seats in the Range
Feelin’ froggy nigga, leap for the chain
What I do to you, will take a little more
Then this beef to explain, we all dogs but you easily tamed
On the wall, we can easily bang
Draw four, then I’m leavin’ the game
Like what for? Cause it ain’t even a game
Let the force, Swiss cheese up ya brain
Walk my dogs on the street with the cane
Call the law, I ain’t easily tamed
It’s House Gang, and we leadin’ the game

[Chorus]

[La Banga]
We hold the drama, dramatically when rap unfolds
It’s welcoming, young with open arms cause youth is bold
And aspect, asset, that be wisely known
Whatever’s been reeped and sown, the best beef is unshown
Live from the battle zone, quiet weapons get blown
With silencers, from the dust to the crack of dawn
Fake done came, and real done gone
For every death, one’s been born
That’s the square, reality ain’t never been fair
But we face it, sins against the Ten Commandment basics
With killings, and duct tape the bodies in the basement
Miles gagged and laced it, this live niggas keep shells
With none wasted, with four niggas play it’s close
We keep it toastess, gripped in the leather hostess
Keep your vest jacket on for them cold shoulders
Ya’ll friend niggas be them same niggas turnin’ cobra
Learn what I told ya

[Chorus]

[Carlton Fisk]
Carlton Fisk is lucky, I ain’t robbed you yet
Want a hundred shot revolver, they ain’t made one yet
So I settle for the red beam that silence the tech
Make a movie, House Gang, nigga reppin’ my set
For every barrio, hood rat, and King Trinidadio
Blood Aruby, Crip to Scooby
Fuck a G.D., we all one gang, please belive me
It’s just the Animal Way Of Life, stroll the strength
No man will hold the fifth
Before you quit, like brrahh nigga, holy six
Carlton Fisk, oh I know that nigga, heard he sick
Plus he H.G., U.D., know they rich
Glow on his wrist, look like a MTV Crib
This how I’m livin’, Donald Goines in the state bid
Live wire, you a if, and, or but nigga
Because you a homo-thug dick in your butt nigga
Wanna talk cash, it’s aight with me
Cause I know that ain’t nothin’ in this life for free
So let me know what you got, so I could roll up
Let me hold what you got, froze gold with the rocks
When I come through your block, I’m live in stereo
Here we go, and for any scenerio, we never worry
Carlton Fisk nigga, and I’m known for the drop
West side highway when I’m stowin’ the cop
Blood in his mouth, ‘till my homie tell me to stop
House Gang, hide now mothafucka, drop down, or you shot

[Chorus]

[Outro: Carlton Fisk]
Cuz we AWOL, Animal Way Of Life
Raider Ruckus, Animal Way Of Life
Donnie Cash, Animal Way Of Life
I.N.S., Animal Way Of Life
La Banga, Animal Way Of Life
All my fames, Animal Way Of Life

[Chingon]
(Verse 1)
She’s so sexy
Can’t wait til she lets me
Sexiest thing, never seen the basics
To me
She means to me the world
My queen, I’ve seen in my dreams, is my girl
Roses on the bed
Roses, where they bed {*wolf whistle*}
Lingerie, many ways to undress
And just to caress
She lets me feel every curve
Til I hit a nerve
Then it’s time to serve
Watch me work it
Yeah, baby, work it
Easy does it (Easy does it)
Softly rubs it
Thought it was when it wasn’t
I knew she’d love it
The way she hug me
Ever so gently, (???)
Insist we
Proceed
Together, we knead
Wanna plant a seed
To live in luxury, for the fantasy
Everlasting

Chorus: Chingon
She’s so sexy to me
Please, baby, to me
You in the world, would you be my girl
She’s so sexy to me
Please, baby, to me
You in the world, would you be my girl
So sexy, sexy

(Verse 2)
Watch me write a rhyme, cause tonight, you’re mine
What’s your sign, how about, we combine
Some of mine with some of yours, but that’s none of yours
But of course, baby doll, it’s whatever you say
Mamacita
It’s your call (Your call)
And you can have it all, from the second I laid eyes on you
Love at first, for better, for worse
Forever and ever
Together is better, write you a letter
And I’m glad I met her (What’s up)
Seen down the block
With my arm around you
Pumpin’ that sounds, feel the beats around you
Me and you
Love it when I tease you, love it when I please you
Then sees you
Never stops seeing you
You know I got good thangs (Good thangs)
So what you wanna do?
Just me and you, baby
Stay true
Forever, my lady

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Everything that a lady could have, a man wants
Good look, the walk, the talk, the way she walks
Makes a man stop, take a second glance (What?)
If I could only get one little chance
The curves on your body with them tight ass pants
Make me wanna do you up, when I see you dance
The way you gettin’ a stance, baby girl, what’s up
Love it up
Live it up
Give it up to me
We could live in luxury, ma, me, you and me
Especially, if it’s meant to be
And you’re meant for me
And eventually
Would bother me
You look so sweet
So sexy (So sweet)
From your head to your feet (Yeah)
So what you wanna do, all night, yeah, me and you
You know that I want you
And I know you want me
So what’s up

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Fatlip]
Feelin’ downtrodden, fresh kid turned rotten
I can’t believe how naive that I’ve gotten
Over the years seems like I’m gettin’ dumber
Reminiscing to a time when I was younger with a hunger
Full of dreams, determination, self-esteem
But now it seems they hesitate to be on my team
You know the routine, when you winnin’ they’re grinnin’
All up in your face, like they was wit’ you from the beginnin’
But on the flipside, when you’re washed up like a riptide
Fools clown ‘bout how you slipped and let shit slide
Beside the fact, my voice is wack
Clowns is runnin’ ‘round, talkin’ ‘bout I smoke crack
Ain’t got no homies that got my back
Yeah I’m a brother, but sometimes I don’t feel black
My girl is white, my game ain’t tight\t\t
Niggas who ain’t seen me in a while be like "Dude, you aight?"

Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like

[KRS-One: What do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?]

[Fatlip]
Goin’ like a sucka almost every day
In the back of your mind you’re prob’ly thinkin’ I was gay
But naw, I’m just a bitch-ass nigga
The type that’d get jacked if I was a rich ass nigga
See. I been a loser just about all my life
Type that tryna turn a ho into a housewife
What do you expect, I give respect
And feel for hoes niggas keep in check
I’m far from hard, emotionally scarred
On Pico Boulevard I was regarded as a retard
I make myself sick, get on my own nerves
Immature, insecure grown up nerd
Has-been MC on a label that’s unstable\t\t
Choppin’ bliggy on the table

[KRS-One: What do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?]

Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
Who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
When they be like "What’s up Fatlip?," and I say "Coolin’"
who am I kiddin’, who am I foolin’
when they be like "What’s up Fatlip?" (ahh)

* only Trek Life’s verse was provided by MMG

"Ladies and gentlemen it’s rap time"

[Hardwerk]
Steppin out the motherfuckin dark matter
I see numbers and I talk data
Feel the beat in my heart’s pattern
Movin at the speed of the planet’s orbit
Breathe in oxygen and absorb it
breathe it out and transform it
My DNA’s prehistoric, twisted up and encoded
Mixture of two of those who consented and then consorted
My mind is full of files, it’s only I who can sort it
So let me say exactly who I am
I’m a West coast vegan nerd with bad times and with words
that digress, and already spelled shit on my shirt
Just a nice guy, but all the ladies think I’m tryin to flirt
I wish I knew what it was, so I can know how it work
A bookworm, who’s hooked on phonics and good herb
I could turn, this verse into something you could learn
After research, but after research, I’d rather teach ‘Werk
And I keep shirts, the same color as Greedy Smurf

"Ladies and gentlemen it’s rap time"

[Trek Life]
Your albums are dope rap deficient
Them beats sound like they eaten yo’ ass alive
I swear to God you shouldn’t have a fan that exist
and y’’ll don’t wanna see my tribe like we canibalistic
If you but any microphone near my hand
I’ma rip it straight up Infirmary style
All my soldiers is the illest
with no known cure or vaccine man we villains
In your system taken over like addiction
Ladies love the diction, that’s no pun intended
Y’all went for the sprint and, your campaign is winded
Tried to buy the love spending cash on a friendslist
But that can’t cover up the fact you ain’t gifted
Who me I’m like Christmas, Hanukkah & kwanza
I sonned y’all daily man I’m kinda like your father
10 steps beyond ya, give y’all GI Janes and Jane Fonda’s
with broken down rap lives to ponder

"Ladies and gentlemen it’s rap time"

[Bishop Lamont]
I kick the hottest shit ever scene
since the Byzantine empire; verbal menace, part chemist
Spit Greek fire
I be that emcee that emcees secretly admire
Blessed by the Messiah, dressed in regular attire
I live in God’s Attic, from the roof I’m even higher
So let’s G-O, turn my foes into vegetables
And stir fry it if the weapon blows
Yeah; my demeanor
is a cross between a great white shark and the Grim Reaper
I whisper death through yo’ speaker, at low frequencies
See frequently the hoes freak with me, creep with me
If she missin, I might know where yo’ bitch could be
Huh~! I’ve been grand with layer, probably where I lay her
out in Maui, blue waters around me
Waldorf-Astoria, where you clowns ain’t be
I’m overdue to celebrate it
Ten years up in this bitch and niggaz hate it
I’m just warming up, incincerate it
Hot ‘til I’m sizzlin, pop I’m hot you fizzlin
Your career’s slowin down like it’s on Ritalin
I begin extend where you faggots end
The Mayans was describin me
New reign of terror bring the whole world catastrophe
I’m so fly bird flu make you sick of me
You niggaz make songs on me, I make history
Been ready, preperation breeds victory
I’m legendary - you rappers ain’t shit to me

"Ladies and gentlemen it’s rap time"

There comes a time
In everyman’s life where he’s got to face
The truth no matter what
We are coming to you father
With our sins and everything
To thank you

Those that smoke marijuana
Wanna thank you father
For making it grow internationally
They wanna thank you lord
Even though police cut it down
Sometimes they burn it down
But it grows again
Thank you father

[Chorus]
We wanna thank you father
For everything you’ve given us

Nations that oppress other nations
Wanna thank you father
Even though it’s painful to be oppressed
But they thank you...
For making them strong

Politicians thank you father
For making them to be able
To lie with a straight face
While the nation cries
They wanna thank you lord

[Chorus: till fade]

My wrist on a count of dup, get ready ‘fo it bubbles up, yup

And I ain’t got love, it’s good reason why I’m rich as fuck but sho ‘nuf
Same good reason to make ‘em go nuts when I pull out the aqua green truck
With the diamond in the back, 26 shinin
What mo can I say, I’m ballin and I’m on fire

Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Grym Reaper (Gatekeeper)]
Like the older you get the more you regret
(YaknowI’msayin, wanna know what we like?)
Do the knowledge, do the knowledge of this
Check it, yo

[Grym Reaper]
Ever watch a hard rock when he got a seed?
Turn a whole hundred and eighty degrees
The nigga that you never saw smile before
It’s like the warrior at peace with the child at your door
It’s mad wild how he holds the mold
It’s so fragile knowin that this little soul is agile
Meanwhile deep in his thoughts
Is how do I protect it from the streets and the courts
There’s stress and strain tryin to maintain
When you’re poor workin odd jobs for small change
You either rap, rob, girls slob knobs
And niggas sell crack, weed or coke for the mob

[Gatekeeper]
The Al Corleone idol was his mentor, gangster
That came up short
You’re needin dentures
Built his rep for killin Aztecs in distortion
Front page news for the projects
Carried the weight for his mom’s operation
25 years workin for the train station
Cause he was black the community reacts
Summer tricks, picnic for kids, he gave it back
He ain’t accept it, grinned and helped the church, clear his debit
Wind up helpin young brothers makin records
When the people lookin at cha from the outside
Open your mouth wide and say "Aiiight!"

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Gatekeeper]
People wonder why when my man died
I didn’t even cry
Melted on the inside
Now I’m becomin like a runner
Sweatin like a plumber
My heart started poundin like thunder
Yo am I ready for revenge that depends
On how my future look in the bends
Is my life worth losin
My seed, my wife
Gettin my life snatched for makin wrong right

[Grym Reaper]
I was always on the calm tip
Last brother to harm or bomb shit
Now I’m on some real Vietnam shit
The quiet storm til the riot is on
I despise doin harm but my foes gotta be conquered
As I warn my peeps "Beware the beast that creep the streets"
Spillin your plasma on the concrete
Killin the murderer, acts of war
Villains attack the poor
Women and children pack heat now
Growin up I was sad young buck
Dad said "Son look don’t become corrupt"
I knew he really meant well
To see me represent and excel
But yo the torments of hell lay dormant until
I try to escape out of the muck and the mire
Nearly got killed bein stuck in the fire
Like Jeremiah
I weep for my peeps gettin bucked from the streets to the choir

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Truemaster]
I’m lettin mines out
I can see through I can see through
Who you want me to believe you are?
Front shine and son knowin you’re a fallen star
I see the look in your eyes when I pass you in my car
I been felt the vibe so I played you from afar
Your problem is you think too negative
It perpetuates your condition and cuts short your ambition
You’re not a wicked one son
You need development
Don’t worry when things are irrelevant
You need to let it out cause it could cause you bad health
Hidin your emotions could rob you from yourself
(Gravediggaz) Hide you from yourself

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don’t get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Grym Reaper (Gatekeeper)]
Yeah
The older you get the more you regret
(Just let it out
If you can heed it, the only way to defeat it)
Hidden emotions, hidden emotions
(Is to let out what’s hidden)
We all got em
Gotta let em shine

Get Up, get up

Concise on the mic
My man Kemo on the board
We, we gon’ turn it out, we, gon’ turn it out

[Verse 1: Concise]
I want it all, I want it right this minute
Somethin’ got to give in this bitch
I’m gonna finish what I started, blow up and get rich
I took it from the bottom to the top, yeah you heard of me kid
You on some murder me shit? African niggaz will spark it
Spread your name across town, with a pernament marker
I’m a marksmen, aim with the skill of a archest
Take a little of ya top, like a villian is bobbin’
I’m feelin’ is harder, but I figuered I’m +fathered+
To these niggaz I be +sonnin’+ ‘cause I’m stronger and smarter
Keep a eye on your daughter, ‘cause she hot and she bothered
Have her suckin’ and slobbin’ like Tina & Robin
I mean tell about these niggaz, these rappers is not ‘sane
Concise is a killah, admit it he got game
Tell me if you wit it, we wit it, we not playin’
You sleepin, wake up when the Tech start sprayin’

[Chorus X 2]
We gon’ rock tha house
We gon work it out
It’s not hard, but simple we gon’ learn it up
We ain’t tryin’ to save money, we gon’ burn it up

We gon’ front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We gon’ front, back, side to side

Let it go baby girl, let your hair down low
Pick up your life young sis, it ain’t nuttin’ to throw
Pick up a mic young brother, don’t be fuckin’ wit doe
I was once it your shoe co cuttin the coke
Lifestyles of the broke, bein’ famous ain’t a joke
It ain’t it all it’s cracked up to be
Whether you actin’ or rappin’ or black athelete
We all got to eat, so I’m fast on my feet
Pray to God I don’t sleep
When oppurtunity knock, in the form of a beat
On my rap sheets, the ink of my pen
I got a feelin’ imma see you again
‘Cause I’m that amibitous, and I never go against ya wishes
I got nuttin’ but love

[Chorus 2X]
We gon’ rock tha house
We gon work it out
It’s not hard, but simple we gon’ learn it up
We ain’t tryin’ to save money, we gon’ burn it up
If you tryin’ to get doe, nigga turn it up

[Verse 3: Concise]
And just get that money, you can burn it up
And just slap that booty, ‘cause it’s firm as fuck
They say ‘Cise, that’s that nigga that be gettin’ it right
Proved some talk with the hands, but I’m good with that pencil
I’m authentic, but you ain’t nuttin’ more then a stensil
A night out for us, you know it’s crazy eventful
So please approach wit at most respect
The African King Click, down go another chick
Stick and move like I’m trainin’ for the fight of my life
Imma die with a neck full of ice
I’m frozen in rhyme, stuck can’t get through a line
When I’m finished imma smoke me a dime

[Chorus 2X]
We gon’ rock tha house
We gon work it out
It’s not hard, but simple we gon’ learn it up
We ain’t tryin’ to save money, we gon’ burn it up
If you tryin’ to get doe, nigga turn it up

Come and get your grill
Ha-ha
Right

[Verse 1]
There’s no rest for the weary just another day grinding up stones
Till they turn into dust, it’s tough, dimes in the rough
Diamonds ain’t enough to cover up a corrupted and fucked up legacy of strange fruit
Bloody whips and small pox, trigger-happy cocks
Barbed wire and fire water, y’all it don’t stop
Whether colonizing game with the cross and the sword
I threw the first spear and said "I declare war!"
I’m a battle-scar wearing heir apparent
Descendants of a long lineage of proletariat and peasant

[Hook]
So check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
So when they say anything
Say "why is it?"
Class is in session ‘til the teacher gets a pink slip
I ride the rhythm and vibe a little whine talk
Head get the concrete to line wit’ your spine

[Verse 2]
I speak to find peace but its war all the time
It’s deep like the drive from Renton to Shoreline
I’m a more mindful guy ever since finding out that
I’m about to be a father and doubt is not an option
And now I can’t be getting crunk and faded as often
So get your hands dirty ‘cause a prayer ain’t enough
Boss, what cross?
We got crucified by buckshots
One million Jesuses and Judas got his nuts off
Pages torn out the memory of those who remain shackled
in the chains of international capital gain
They claim civilize with they animal ways
Peace to Oakland, I’ve never been a fan of the A’s
But some days you can find me inscribed in my soul on the page every crime has an alibi
Disciplined and organized is how I handle my
New jacks are spending mad time on their battle rhymes
I can’t knock it if you find it entertaining
I rep those whose labor ain’t compensated

[Hook]
So check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
So when they say anything
Say "why is it?"
Class is in session ‘til the teacher gets a pink slip
Forty to a class, no wonder we delinquent
Half the school district never make it to commencement

[Verse 3]
I’ve been the spine of the track until it snaps
Pops working overtime and he got a broken back
Got three little sisters, one brother in Iraq
And mom prays novenas to keep the fam intake
But the song ain’t a song waiting for God to answer
Brothers call me "Dog", they got the letters backwards
I’m back with a plan of attack to reposes my
Main face in history y’all who wanna test
My capacity to spit caliber shit into a rhythmic lesson
And entertainment’s a legitimate weapon
Igniting the cipher sessions I’m deciphering life
And blended both theory into practice I write
Vernacular and actual fact
Got no posturing
A thousand points and fingers I defied every one of them
I ride for my brethren who carry the burden
of a future uncertain ‘til the fall of the curtain
You better move
Hold your head high soldier, it ain’t over yet
That’s why we call it a struggle
You’re supposed to sweat

[Hook]
Check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
So when they say anything
Say "why is it?"
Class is in session ‘til the teacher gets a pink slip
Crazy landlady tried to switch up on the lease
If she raises up the rent again it’s time to say "peace"

Peace, peace and that’s my piece
It’s still all about the bullet in the belly of the beast
From the East my brother we came
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
So when they say anything
Say "why is it?"
Class is in session ‘til the teacher gets a pink slip
So keep marching ‘til your feet split open
"No Rest For The Weary" Blue Scholars keep going

[Intro: Hell Razah]
Maccabee Military, machine gun
Stand up... wave ya AK’s with ya face bandage

[Chorus 2X: Hell Razah]
No M.C.’s original, it’s nothing new fucking with Sun
Many’ll call, but a few will come
This be the revolution, choose a gun
You either run with us, or choose to run
This be the Maccabee machine gun

[Hell Razah]
We was raised offa Marvin Gaye, now look at us now
We King Tuts of the modern day
Got hands like Langston Hughes, drop jewels
Like Curtis Mayfield, make gangsta blues
Black Jew rap, Sammy Davis, write a script
Like Spike Lee, to take back our forty acres
Aiyo the hood is my resident, God is my President
I still hear pops playing Duke Ellington
In the project to keep felons in, more veterans
War veterans, coming home, more heroin
More guns in the minors hand
They wanna fuck up my future plans, man

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
My revolutionary fears hell, son of Israel
Outlaw, cuz I’m known to skip bail, Maccabee watch our shit sale
My nine spit shells, out like waves to beaches
It is real as the braveheart fatal creatures
I light candles and I say thesis
Raised by G’s, born in the 40’s
Told me stories, none are happy
End as they all, ending gory
Told me that the same government is coming for me
So what I do? Go back to apartment, 4D
Went in my closet, grabbed the burner with the rocket
They want me, they gotta take my whole projects
Fuck ya’ll, I’m in the back getting foot massages
We the realest, you all marages
Maccabee, Black Israelites, liberal life
Nights in prison, fight the system, Muslims, Jews and Christian
The hoodlum serving food in kitchens
Polishing, just try’nna full the listens
Listen up, project hallways, since the 4th grade
Since I smashed more brains, my nephew he had always
Back in the days, the track leap from the grave
To the stage, we Maccabeez, gats and trees
Yeah, gats and trees, we Maccabeez
Relax and breathe, we actually
The master is me, yo, faculty
Black fatigues, we clap at you P
U-S-S-I-Es, fuck ya’ll, yeah, we Maccabeez muthafucka

[Sean Garrett]
Junior high played them
High school played them
College well, you know... played them
Me and my friends use to laugh about it, how we fade ‘em
Now cupid is aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalence can I be, with you here starring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries.

[Chorus]
For the first time I’m in love,
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what I’m feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody the feel...

Drizzy... Drake.

[Drake]
All them men before me did shit I would never do
And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
Just keep fightin’ for our lovin’ baby, I’ll defend it too
And if they try and tell me time is money I’d spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
And pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl,
I’m worth trying, but take it easy on me
Cause this my first time

[Chorus]

[Sean Garrett]
Now baby, baaaby
You doin’ things with my heart ain’t never felt, it’s so crazy
[? ] if you gonna let it change me, I was so mistaken
Your love like a billy coupe, took me out of a Mercedes
Now baby, baaby
For so long I miss somebody
my heart just couldn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t played with it
I went from not wanting a girlfriend to needing ya lady
I didn’t think I’d ever see
me callin to you, you voice before I go to sleep

[Chorus: repeated]

[Sean Garrett]
I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and I’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’ (don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable)
I see us growing (no, no one don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t wanna miss out on a feeling I ain\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t never had before)
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you’da done to me, I gotta let’em know

[Chorus: repeated]

[Sean Garrett]
Two hearts, I use to say
Might make a great movie to watch on a late night
But for me it ain’t the way
But baby thanks to you (I changed)

[J. Cole]
I’d swore I’d never fall
but I fell, run and tell
all my old bitches
erase none of my old photos
baby girl a part of me but
don’t text stop calling me
I aint your nigga, don’t bother me
fuck your twitter, don’t follow me
my new girl too thorough
but believe it or not she’s all I need
thought I was a player R.I.P
down goes Frazier call Ali
lets hit the mall and its all on me
cuz girl you deserve it
if I take this chance and make these plans
I gotta know girl is you worth it perfect

[Masta Killa sample]
This is a gathering of the masses
That come and pay respect to the Wu-Tang Clan

[Dr. Ama]
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Suuuuuuu
Return of the Dragon, Shaolin killer style
Fatigue pants sagging, Breaking backs like Chinese Hercules
Enemies fearing these vocal slugs that’s slow from impact loaded with
Mercury
The killer, Slang spiller like blood on the murder scene
Had to gain knowledge of self so every word’ll gleam
Verbal team consist of the Wu-Tang swordsmen
The Lords in this mental chess game the rest estain pain
Vision blurry, To peace you with my fists of fury
Surely, Perverted Monk purely to Judge and Jury
We roll, Let’s have a duel of the iron fist
I pitty the fool, As Wu combine hits with flying kicks
The Iron Maiden got the vital signs fading fast
The Street Fighter, Technique is trash, You can’t last
S.I. be the deadly Avengers
Dipped in black, To attack in the night like a ninja
We enter, Severally bruised, Manchuz surrender
With no clues of how Wu’s techniques dismember
Your last breath cause this game of death is breath-taking
Chinese connection got your whole opposing section shaking
First you was bragging, Now the Clan got ya jagging
Your like the price you pay when you Enter the Dragon

[Various Wu-Tang samples]
My clan is thick like plaster, Bust ya, Slash ya
Never teach the Wu-Tang
I bomb atomically, Socrates’ philosophies and hypothesis
Can’t define how I be dropping these
Are you a warrior, Killer, Slicing shit like a Samurai
Yo, Yo fuck that, Look at all these crab niggas laid back
The Meth will come out, Tomorrow
Styles get busy, Bizarre, Bizarro
Ohh, What, Grab my nut get screwed
Oww, Here comes my Shaolin style
Champion gear that I rock and get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit then lock shit down
There’s no place to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, Prepare for the boom
Vocabulary Donna talking, Tell your story walking
Wu-Tang Clan aint nothing to fuck with...

Just show a little flesh
Let me see a little flesh (mami, mami)
Just show a little flesh
Let me see a little flesh (mami, mami)
Just show a little flesh
Let me see a little flesh

[Rome Rap 1]
I’m so hood and I cant change
Rip blocks from Venice
All the way to Fullton to Saint James
LA to BK
Young Rome and I’m serious
Born hustler more clever then my nemesis
Pop bottles like I’m Michael Jordon in the 90’s
Six ring all I do is big things
Fall sickin
My taste
Big ass, small waist
Flawless face
Really don’t matter the race
Cause we all black as soon as the lights go out
If the head good I might show out
If its right I’m tight like a feen
When dis pipe blow out
The fifth ward
Let a psycho out
Young Rome like a redneck with his rifle out
What’s that glow, mami ice no doubt
Rhinestone never
We have conference calls with Jacob
Been like this ever since I got my cake up
Pick up the dirt off the concrete and shake up
Been caring my timbs since B2K break up
I’m like Patton with no Shaq, Kobe the mailman
One word that don’t compete in my brains is failing man

[Chorus]
Mami show a little flesh ,let me see you ma
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he’s a chi-chi man
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma

[Rome Rap 2]
We bag more then broads
We bag cities
You can have those hood rats with those t-bag tities
Rome gotta like him I’m slappin these dudes silly
Rip the nerve out your body that don’t feel me
I rock the party like Bizzy B in his prime
I’m cool as an AC I’m not Busta Rhymes
No disrespect but I’m smooth as a Jazz artist
But live as the Roots
Homey I’m beyond the hottest
I’m not a star
I’m the sun
Not #2
I am the 1
I am not a rose
I am the gun
And I spit for the half niggas sleep on cots
Started from nothing
Dreaming of boats and yachts
Man I use to dream a lot but then I stop sleepin
Got on my grizzle and kept bizzy
Got my mind right, money right
Never tricked
Chicks mad cause i’m tight
Cheap as a birds language
I aint the one mami

[Chorus]
Mami show a little flesh ,let me see you ma
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he’s a chi-chi man
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma

[Rufus Blaq Rap]
Man I done seen it all
Niggas clapped up over brick shoot outs
With po-po, pepper stray, bully sticks
Broads impressed with this willy shit
Think willy’s a trick?
Have Diddy sippin on Cris on some silly shit
I don’t drink from yellow bottles
I like my liquor brown as Judge Joe
Hold a grudge no
I erase enemy’s like Bubba fat
Take stars to ball
Clap like the grammy awards
Down hits, seven up
Spit hit, seven up
Missed seven enough
Shredem up
Setem up, wetem up
Shock wont letem up
Hittem twice more cause he aint dead enough
Call me iron man
Think I’m sexy now
You should see me in my boxer
You think my flow is obnoxious
I got old donuts in my refrigerator
Harder then you
You niggas know how we do
What bitch!!!

[Repeat Chorus]

So this one’s dedicated to the style thieving suckers
Here comes the wise man
Methods of dropping’ mental
But no one open doors
For I self Lord and master
Have to be an independent source of life and matter
Why just for me to matter
Or just for you to listen
Some can’t figure me 
They say I’m just too complicated
They ask me what my age
Then I have no recollection
They ask me "what religion?"
But religions not important 
Principle, culture, nation
Civil law and order
I’m checking
I self lord and the P-R-T P-ossee see it
Every style we drop some one come thief it!
But I don’t understand why some of us can’t be creative

From Divineland
New Jerusalem dropping it

Snakes in the meadow
Grass cut low
When the snake’s head show
The snake’s head go
See I don’t mess around with no snake
Cause I’m the snake’s meat 
Greet me
Then he beats me
For something I created
Maker and the owner of the style
So I profile like I made it
It takes an A plus to grade it
Wise come flashing the style of fashion
And I sometimes think
About the purified words, ways, actions
????? Just to show and prove that I posses these first
The mental principles of the universe
Weight that of knowledge
Culture say "on with"
And I proceed
Now one’s own need
Greed
Envy, lust, jealousy
Will kill a man 
It’s that simple.
Well umm yes
I understand it takes a teacher to explain the very essentials

And these motherfuckers running around here with nothing in their pocket

[Verse One - Young Buck]

Come outside the club legs is cocked up on the grass
Smoking pounds of this skunk while you rolling dime bags

Totally Independent Pimping in uh GS3
Keep on jacking off that money you’ll never see uh key

Priest told me from the jump never go and get that cheese
D-Tay went and got the pump now where creeping while you sleep
Gangbang slang cane whatever just maintain
Listen man there’s a million niggaz doing the same thang
Plain Jane sipping syrup while the BG playing
I’m all in your lane in this 99 Sudan
So when a nigga put them daytons on that’s when the hatings on
"Bitch get some money!" what ‘cha you niggaz waiting on?

[Hook - Young Buck (Gutter Boy)]

You got to be a Go-Getter-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail
Cuz real thugs shed blood and they hard to kill
Listen this shit they call money ain’t going to fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getter-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail
Cuz real thugs shed blood and they hard to kill

[Quanie Cash]
If I sit around waiting of these world of payment
I’ma get it how I live it or die trying to make it
A chance I’ll take it if its worth it cuz I’m all about money
My name speaks for itself I’ma let them others keep fronting
I keep my keys coming cuz I’ma motherfucking thug
And I keep my heat busting ain’t no love from my slugs
Use to sever underground now as real as on top
But if a nigga broke I ain’t scared to get back on there on the block
Running from cops and jumping out of automobiles
Cuz I’m dirty I ain’t trying to go back to jail and that’s real
Niggaz get they hands out like money be falling out the sky
If it is I wonder where it be at when I’m outside
I put in work for this shit; I did dirt for this shit

[Gutter Boy]
I can Shogun in a bottom or I can Shogun in Harlem
I Shoguns at a problems squeeze triggers and solve them
The hoe they love us to death and the copper can’t stand us
Cuz I sell more chickens then motherfucking Colonel Sanders
F.B.I trying to kill us with the ray guns and cameras
The only block all they saw was thugs with braids and bandanas
If selling dope was boxing I’ll be the greatest of all time
See the niggaz in my click and bitch we all shine
We all tote 9’s I was born to be the king
This nigga was moving birds so I had to clip his wings
Now I’m driving top drops sporting flints and rings and things
At the club they say my name hoes where sure the skirts came
Ain’t no shame in my game I was born to ball
Yo trying to play me glock pop guns born to ball
Born to brawl when ya niggaz was born to stall
What you make in a week is what I spend at the mall

[Hook - Young Buck (Gutter Boy)]
Nigga this shit they call money ain’t going to fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getta-Nigga (ride or die!)

RJD2 drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
Driftin away, and depress all within listening range
Nah but for real I got so much shit on my mind
From fake motherfuckers to my future I’m trying to get in line
And doing hip hop in this life in time ain’t all nice and fine
At times I feel like my whole life’s a rhyme
Full of punchlines and jokes
Fuck ups and punches
It’s like I can’t get shit right the first time or something
When no one knows your name, your vinyl’s still in stores
Once you get a little light through arguing over who feels it more
We got sixteen year old dead heads buying garbage
Wanting to keep you from their personal private artists
We don’t do shit for the clubs
It’s for our forty fives, 
go RJ the archaeologist diggin them up
And I’m the same cent, 
To vinyl that gets sent to bash
In this for life til my final mic check is cashed

Televised revolutions on the net
Only yet we’re witnessing connecting us could pose a threat
Over through the openness of poverty & hopelessness
Cover it with shadows of a mob, tipping over stress
& they’ve got their torches lit
Progressive acting vocalist
Close the lips of those who only wish to keep on holding whips
Stolen chips are given back, what be that, Sherwood
Justice wears the face of us, who be that, Thurgood
Butter flies are flapping wings
off the banks of river Nile
Entitled waves amass a scene
wash away the villains vile
This is how we disembowel
The belly of beast
Another message from the east
I only hope we hear it loud
Let the wise men deliver, to the salivating crowd
Thirsty for the end of hurting, fiending to begin the plow
Plant the seeds for the pupils raised in the ways of now
Present for the present state to never let it come around

& My, my look at the times we’re living in
As blind eyes begin to see the vivid end 
As time dies, a new era fit to begin
Let’s celebrate the end, & get to starting over

Birth of a nation
Problems that they’re facing
Shadowed by rejoicing tears, cry for liberation
Indeed congratulations is in order
I’m from north of the border
Responsible for the slaughter
I was on their side
For them I’ll always ride
Being raised in the states, I learned we’re in the same tribe
Niggas in the eyes of those from outside
They wanted us to die, it’s conquer & divide
It’s all for the oil that rest beneath our soil
Within our turmoil their nations are going to thrive
It’s too late though
The murders & the rape
Have replaced how we relate
With the kind of hate though
All according to plan
Use the color of a man
Then divide up all his land
As if it was fate though
But good luck though to my brothers in the south
Africa’s youngest country hope you show them what you’re about

& My, my look at the times we’re living in
As blind eyes begin to see the vivid end 
As time dies, a new era fit to begin
Let’s celebrate the end, & get to starting over

[sample from some other tune]
"... wrench, adapt to ‘98
 Signal flow forwardmost, we almost dislocate
 We attach the dispatch back to catch the..."

[Verse One]
I’ve always been popular, get off the dick
hurdle barbwire give your ballsack a rip
to you jellybutt’s doin calisthenics to Luke’s tape
Good lookin out bitch, good luck on the weight
I’m snotty, I’m in the in crowd, I toldja
Walk into the kegger with a twelver on my shoulder
Wassup, bro? High-five, yo nice rack bitch
I’m stuck up, I’m sheltered and I’m hella rich

[Chorus]
I hate you, you suck, you are the worst person
Even if your mother is the holy virgin
I hate you, you suck, you are the worst person
Even if your father is the man behind the curtain
I hate you, you suck, you are the worst person
I hate you, you suck, I hate you, you suck
I hate you, you suck, you are the worst person
I hate you ... you suck

[Verse Two]
I hate that guy, he’s a loser he’s a dork
He can’t get chicks, he’s ugly and he’s short
He can’t play sports and he don’t even drink
Don’t know the words to the song, don’t know why pussy stink
Imagine, walking through life as him
If I was I’d put my fat head in the oven
He’ll never be cool, he’s better off to join the circus
I kiss myself and thank God that I’m perfect

[Chorus] - new 2nd line - "Even if your mother use the new improved detergent"

[Verse Three]
My shit don’t stink and my gear never wrinkles
I’ve had it up to here with you incompetent people
You know the drill, bring the virgins and cold beer
Don’t front on the Messiah like I ain’t standin right here
Turn from my gaze as I step in the place
Jerk off on the stand, watch me come beat the case
It’s killin me, I swear, all this good food and tight snatch
Be sure where your wife’s at cause FOOL I’m just like that

[Verse Four]
I was dippin, pickin on nerds in the lunchroom
When all of a sudden I got dumped on, dude
The pimple-faced geek I used to cheat off in class
Pulled on a ski mask and Swiss-cheesed my ass
So now I’m in a coma and body cast
Waitin on this fine nurse to give me a sponge bath
Even when I’m beat I’m still treated the best
It’s obvious he did it cause he was jea-lous

[Chorus] - new 2nd line - "Even if your mother never listened to the serpent"

Hey love

[ VERSE 1 ]
Females are shady as they wanna be (wanna be)
Out for the cheese, but they wanna beef
Slidin to the side, but you can’t see over me
We gon’ keep it real, to the glass, let the Mo\xc3\xabt spill
How you feel, is you wantin me? (ah-ah)
Well, money shady, make a lady act ficticiously
That’s why I love it, baby can’t get close to me
I built a gate, hawk-eye the game closely
That’s why I’m straight, what these thugs thinkin of
Tryin to split me and my love
We gon’ flow like a dove sack to hit em back
Cause I saw it, hummin, comin at me
These fools bustin and it’s comin rapidly
Don’t you know me, homie? I’m about what you about
Peep, creep while you sleep, clean your whole stash out
20 g’s all dubs, player, what you got
Smokin hay with my love, keep spendin, won’t stop

[ CHORUS ]
Hey love
May I have a word with you
I lied to you, yeah
Guess what I been going through

[ VERSE 2 ]
I used to think you love everything I stood about
Never once did you doubt the fact I’ll make it out
This ghetto, push a Benz, D Troop, Wayne and Twins
Bust a broad, call a friend, it’s off the heezy once again
Let em never come between us, never take us to the cleaners
Steady dippin out the backdo’ with Funky Cold Medina
I seen it in her eyes, analyze, play the game too
Don’t be sloppy, boo, or I be droppin you
Off at your mama’s house, no Jerry Springer bout
Cause that’s the felony, that’s what they tellin me
And it’s my word like a spelling, bee
I rather see Pam Grier round here, Foxy Brown with me
Except you stay around, lie, clown, die with me
Split the pie 50/50 eye to eye with me
That’s on the game, mack gotta be
The best on the west, start a worldwide lottery

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
How many women out here want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a ‘I do’, but you’re ‘I maybe’s
Baby, I want a fly lady, 5-Mercedes
Body lookin damn good, still drive me crazy
The kind that like the ice watch cause it freeze time
Don’t ask the price on that cause I gees mine
I’m a city slicker from a slicker city
Baby from the country, so she brick-buildin titty
I’m on the West coast, so I’m one of those boys
To match up the preacher daughter with the homeboy
How many women out there want a million
Graduate, then wait to have children
How many girls out there with five babies
Waitin for a ‘I do’, but you’re ‘I maybe’s

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

Last time around we left you guessin
Sit down, learn your lesson, boy
We’re back, can’t you see?
Maybe you’re b-l-i-n-d
Or so the story goes
From my mind the rhyme flows like a domino
Fallin one by one like the sun goin down
But we’re still around town
We’re here to stay, we didn’t come to play
Cause that’s not our way
Okay? Is it clear to your ear?
The fear you felt
The last time I dealt
My rhymes at the top of my lungs
Rung by rung we climb till we get some
And now we got it, we’re takin a vow
Let it be known: you can’t sotp us now

You can’t stop us now\t(2X)

A stab in the dark, a shield from the light
Master of them all, the knowledge of light
Leader of the land, the savior of the sea
You think of these things when you think of me
M.J., the ruler, sucker duck schooler
Diamond back ( ? ) five finger fooler
Destructor, from our plan
If I can’t do it, nobody can
My man, cause I stand all alone
I took the throne with my microphone
And when everybody ( ? ) I lose it, my friend
I turned around and I did it all again
So you know where you can go
I come across as the boss cause I’m runnin the show
So step back as I take my bow
Witness the truth: you can’t stop us now

You can’t stop us now

Are they crazy? They question me
That’s somethin I can’t believe
Exact, yeah, that’s my name
( ? ) cause this ain’t no game
I’m playin, the rhymes I’m sayin
I’m the butcher, let the slayin
Begin because the end is near
I know you can see, but can’t you hear
What’s goin on
Listen to my beat, listen to my tone
I’m mad, so I’m takin over
I’m puttin you in the dog house, like Rover
The pet, you can bet
It’s as good as good can get
So leave the stage and enter the crowd
It’s written in blood: you can’t stop us now

You can’t stop us now\t(5X)

vocal chords stretched
breakin every bone in the beat
fuck a Source
my shit is five mics on the street
z-mainey, onions on my breath, make you cry
you know the skinny guy, covered in flies, expectin to die
knockin out gangstas with one punch and drank punch
fuck a thugs life my life is what you dream of
your girlfriend’s a nigger lover in case you haven’t noticed
she’s the dopest, her mind is open floatin’ like fish
off of one hit of the spliff, three margaritas
my se\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1orita’s full of tequila
tryna reach us but we at the bar drinkin free beer and eatin peanuts
dank supply lookin mighty low we need to re-up
be up, to another bar there’s like six of us
two AM on the nose and can’t get rid of us
damn, them blunts got your breath smellin like shit
damn, I took about a half an hour beer piss
hopped in the Land
your girlfriend was drivin’
drunk drivin’, crashed into a pole an I was flyin’ through the windshield
landed in the bushes
woke up an hour later, still in the bushes
crawled out the bushes, didn’t see no car
didn’t see no witnesses and walked hella far
fractured my arm, and didnt even notice
woke up the next day like "oh oh shiit!"

[Verse 2]
I’m drinkin Rossi and vodka in the shower
hopped out, drank some jin and juice and got some olives
out of the fridge to make a dirty martini
I threw on Fleetwood Mac and ate a weed brownie
I’m peepin to gurp, the phone rang and it was Head
Head said he comin’ through with Slim and Red
they got drank so I wait
throw on some gear and got draped
Cause we ain’t fittin to kick it over here all day
this is Frisco
chewin on a veggie burrito
we at Slim house burnin weed the record hit the needle
and we vibin’, sample that shit
I had to bounce to get another 40 ounce
I am so gone
weather outside is fillin’ snow cone
kids get they smoke on
brotha put your clothes on
pass me the Cisco
orreee thats my rellie
rollin in his Chevy with his girlfriend Becky
hopped in the back seat and said "wassup Kelly"
they been on gurp all day already
drinkin on a 40 burnin chewies to the music
lookin at the red light, no don’t do it
that’s what I was thinkin’, should’ve said it when we crashed
flipped 6 times, and we spittin up glass
I lost 3 teeth it all happened so fast
homie and his girl were in the street bleeding bad
I was in the front, twisted up seeing stars
Kelly cracked her head open, and broke both her arms

[Verse 3]
I’m from the city where the Chinese be drivin’ ill
with the combination of young kids gettin killed
in they automobiles
funerals are filled, with everybody that you loved

[Killa Tay]
I’m at the point of no return, fuck what you talkin’
I want money like Big Worm, I ain’t tryin’ to get burned
I learned the hard way so now everyday is a holiday
It’s dirty, but it’s the game that we gotta play
It’s all the same from L.A. to the Bay
??? full of pot heads chasin’ the pain
They say the streets ain’t safe, so everybody ride strapped up
??? got it locked, locked the block it’s like that
I got goons posted up at the room
Still coming home smellin’ like gun powder and perfume
Still real from the womb to the tomb
I bring goons, still riding, signing autographs shining like the moon
Step wrong,I light up your life like Pat Goon
Don Dada when the gat boom
Read the headlines, niggaz doin’ fed time stuck in the prison
That ain’t livin’, I know you probly felt like snitchin’
But read what you saw that’s what the good book tell us
If you ain’t M-O-B, you either shook or you jealous
‘Cause we ain’t playin’ with Pellut Guns, you suckas keep bumpin’ ya guns
So now you finally gettin’ fucked like Nuns
It’s halocaust, we gon’ hall ‘em off
All that floss got you headed on a one way trip to a coffin
Fuck talkin’ I’m walkin’ front line with Bo
Until my shine don’t glow or it’s my time to go
But...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[Yukmouth]
Geah.. nigga
Spark the ganja up, H2 Tonka truck
26 deep dish make my shit look like a monster truck
Gettin’ swallowed up by a gangsta bitch, Gobble up
Y’all be givin’ dollas up for pussy, Bitches sponsor us
In the Mob we trust it’s the Mafia, La Kosta Nostra
Lots of Coke and lots of Doja, Lots of Souljas
Mobstas focus, in drops and Rovers
Front work to the block controlla, let him rock ‘n roll ya
Carson Daly, flossin’ daily, and drive Mercedes it ain’t all gravy
Fuck y’all pay me, cross the Mob lose your broad and baby
Police they all hate me, I ball like McGrady
And I’m the one like "Neo", still Desert Eagle
Keep throwin’ bricks like Shaquille at a free throw
Yuk and C-Bo the sequel
Made niggaz that’ll have ya wacked like the Beatle in Casino
Nigga...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[C-Bo]
Got the Benz on 20’s, the Porsche on 19’s
10 Millimeter clips extended to 19’s
Ya never ever cross a killa that’s like me
Tank top, white tee, jeans and Nike’s
Bangin’ since the first day Reagen got elected
Yeah, since the first day AIDS got detected
I ain’t got a problem with touchin’ or bustin’ it’s nothin’
Like AIDS, ya get it like ??? Huston
The vest won’t protect ya, it just slow ya down
Let the gauge racket go up, bet it blow you down
When it come to my money don’t play ho
You’ll have us on your ass like the attack of the killer tomatos
I was born with a halo, turned into horns
Said I was evil my every step would burn through the floor
I’m tired of life, my every turn is to the morgue
Ya little sister grew up in church and turned into a whore...

(Talking about the Mafia)

[Suzy Rock]
We’re living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We’re living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We’re living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We’re living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land

[Trip Lee]
You’re tryna live the dream, ain’t ya?
The cream, esteem, supreme paper
You’re thinkin’ this the place to be, like green acres
Look, you’re livin’ a dream and I can’t even wake
I know you want the life that they all desire
Wanna rise till you can’t imagine climbin’ higher
But that ladder can’t stand when it catches fire
And when it stops, you’ll be shocked, like electric wires
It’s cool to like fairytales
Until you try to live inside of ‘em, that’s where we fail
The media pushin’ death and they do it very well
Man, who woulda thought that obituaries sell?
Look, you’re livin’ in a dream
Open up your eyes, things ain’t always what they seem
Reality ain’t always what we found up on the screen
They got bait, in they hooks, they got rhymes full of schemes, it’s fantasy

[Suzy Rock]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (All they want is that fantasy)
Smokin’ lies, but there is never light within us
The smiles full of envy, a full house that’s empty
Once the night is up, it’s never enough

[Trip Lee]
Your imagination’s runnin’ wild
Your main goal is to stack a couple hundred thou
Then mo’ money, plus you want it now
You be huntin’ for them hundreds till you run ‘em down
Plus you want chicks, wanna pick or choose
She gotta be a freak, not just any chick will do
That’s the story that you stickin’ to, listen dude
Just know the fable that they told you really isn’t true
Hey mami, you think you want that life, don’t you?
See you’re that fine dame all the brothers droolin’ over
But you should know your beauty will be movin’ over
When he cracks the sky like a supernova, to expose us
I ain’t runnin’ game, I ain’t got nothing to gain
‘Bout lyin’ to you ‘bout this life, but something is strange
If the highest joy is found in created things
Instead of something greater but I gotta make a claim, it’s fantasy

[Suzy Rock]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (All they want is that fantasy)
Smokin’ lies, but there is never light within us (It’s crazy)
The smiles full of envy, a full house that’s empty (It’s all empty)
Once the night is up, it’s never enough

[Trip Lee]
Never satisfied
You know, we been livin’ in a dream world
A dream world where we been chasin’ the wrong things
But my prayers is our eyes will open
So we can see it all for what it is

Welcome to the real world
With it’s real treasure, real pearls
Those who try to gain the world only lose souls
And chasin’ fools goals only gets ya fools gold
Well, welcome to the good life with it’s real joy
Now that old life seems like a killjoy
It’s ironic that the life giver was killed, boy
He rose and he chose me, you know he fills a real void
We were made to be connected to the life giver
To build our life around Him, with his life in us
But our pride likes to rise, them lies get us
They separate us from the good, we despise scripture
But we can turn back to the forever source
The One who can’t be described by my metaphors
Even if I’m poor, I’m rich if I let him set the course
At his right hand, the pleasure’s forever more, yeah

[Suzy Rock]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (We don’t have to live in that fantasy)
Smokin’ lies, but there is never light within us (Yeah yeah)
The smiles full of envy, a full house that’s empty (We don’t have to be empty, y’all)
Once the night is up, it’s never enough (‘Cause Jesus is enough)

We’re living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We’re living in la, la, lie, la, la, la, land
And you gon’ see it all for what it is
I pray you’ll see it all for what it is

Lean it back a little
(Lean it back)
Move your head back

This ain’t nothin sweet
Just the beat is sweet
(True, true)
Everything I’ma say is from the flesh
(Speak the truth, God)
Feel you
(I’m feelin you)

See me
I’ve seen the world and try to bring you along
Maybe with a song or maybe with a bong
That helps you rap cats rhyme along
I ain’t changed my style, just my style came back
I’m still a lethal weapon longer than Smith & Wesson made gats
Got raps that are toxic
Like pilots high off meth in cockpits
I pop shit so you understand just what you gettin with
What you standin there for like you a narc in the dark?
While your bitch is swimmin upstream to the stage like they were caught
And in cars parked thumpin while my beat is humpin her
Dented her face up, my ice medaillon was in her face while I was fuckin her
I’m kiddin - I freak mics and not ice
Speak a language more foreign than dick to born dikes
Been above the clouds more times than you cats been off your block
Keep faces dented like cars in L.A. that are rented
I meant 99% of things I usually said
Pete Nice always says I’m nice off the top of my head
I’m glad after all this time my rhymes have struck through
And if they haven’t - real simple: fuck you

You don’t like the way I’m spittin this?
Fuck you
You don’t like the way I’m gettin this?
Then fuck you
Actin like you don’t care, son
And fuck you
Throw them fingers in the air, son
Fuck you

(No games, no games)

Smooth it out a little

Bring it back

Now most of y’all can’t call it if a phone was attached to it
Everyone says they’re in it for the love but there’s a catch to it
Adjust your watch to it, me, I’d rather not do it
You could feel what I’m spittin and still not understand
Like most underhand, and can’t show a young man
How to fuck all them cows, they just want a nut
And then what - pimp strut?
You ain’t shit, so if you’re a man and you holdin down your fam
Or you’re a chick with essentials with ten nails on your hand
And you’re runnin from beast
And you love the state of hip-hop, be it north, south, west or east
And you look for Grease, Dre and my man Swizz Beatz
And you’re fuckin from Serchlite, Ruff Ryder to Dilated Peeps
J5 to J-Live, Good Vibe or Slum V
Then you’re down with 3P, so repeat after me

You don’t like the way I’m spittin this?
Fuck you
You don’t like the way I’m gettin this?
Fuck you
You act like you don’t care, son?
Fuck you
And throw them fingers in the air, son
And fuck you

[ VERSE 1 ]
Now I’m gonna sit down and let the rhythmn spark a brain cell
Spontaneous the way that I dwell
And to the beat like a predator, the stage is my habitat
When I’m at war mic becomes a battle axe
I write the lingo to hype up this single
I make you fever for the flavor like Pringles
Design a rhyme like a strategist
When I plan the attack all the suckers get mad at this
To prove the point that Tone is on the uprise
He’ll drop a beat so Marquis can improvise
Super vocal, the hyped up dopefiend
If I was meant to flow, I’d flow upstream
To show an MC that my approach is different
No beating around the bush cause I’m straight up business
Reactin like molecules to cause your friction
Tone is my producer, Kay does the mixin
Right on time I intertwine with the rhyme
I let the beat flow smooth so I can add the bassline
I get the cue for me to give an example
Yo Kay, get quick on the mix, give em a sample

[ VERSE 2 ]
As a wise man said, you have to prove you’re worthy
That’s why I grab the mic and I show no mercy
Get straight to the point like steel to a  magnet
Time to detonate, watch for the fragments
I take rhymes, stick em to the beat, he’s pitchin
The rap Bo Jackson’s up and I’m hittin
You a homerun that’s pumpin to the maximum
No time to slow down, so I’ma add some
Style and techniques by one rhymer and a DJ
We’re sittin on the world, listenin to the replay
Runnin backtracks, never eat a bowl of Sugar Smacks
Cause when I rhyme I’m a potent aphrodisiac
Makin your hormones quicken with the blend
I take a pause on a break and let the rhymes flow in
Slow like a thunder cloud, inconspicuous
For me to grab the crowd, make a sap look ridiculous
The art of war is to conquer all obstacles
For this soldier nothin is impossible
My pulse rate quickens when it’s time to unwind
Just gimme the mic and it’s showtime

[ VERSE 3 ]
Track three, yo Tone, what you’re doin?
Pump up the bass, I feel a brainstorm brewin
And that’s when it’s time to come smooth like satin
It’s the bottom of the ninth, I’ll do the battin
I’m sittin and waitin with a rhyme on a enema tongue
Like a viper ready to strike one
Down, and leavin no wounds intent to
And 911, homebody, cannot help you
When I let the DJ spark my combustion
And all the words form from the pen I’m clutchin
Down on line paper, the newest rap caper
Who rhymes like a bystander with this tape of
Paragraphs, sentences, words and adjectives
Combine it all togetheer on lyrics is what’s happenin
Marquis’s shinin with the sparkle of a dope rope
And I’m winnin, make the suckers hope
To ever try to get it or even want it
But only the chosen few could ever flaunt it
In ways that pays for things that are material
Barin a course straight for your cerebral
Membrane, or audible organ
Or should I say our eardrum to change the slogan
The term which explains why the DJ’s scratchin
It’s because of the drum and his allergic reaction
To the suckers on the sideline who need an example
Yo Kay, get quick with the mix, give em a sample

[Verse 1: Britney Spears (Autotuned)]
I’ve been thinking, just sitting thinking
On why I love you and all my reasons
And if I lost you, boy if I lost you
I’d lose myself and I wouldn’t feel the way I feel now
You bring me’s in, yes you bring me’s in
You make me feel like a million, billion
I’ll let you in but don’t you break my heart
Don’t you rip me apart, boy don’t you rip me apart

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Baby, love, it should be eaaaa-aaaa-asy
It shouldn’t be complicated
It should be eaaaa-aaaa-asy
I don’t know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

(I - don’t - know -- how - to - say it)

[Verse 2: Britneyy Spears (Autotuned)]
I’ve got visions, boy I’ve got visions
of me and you, happily just living
I know they’re out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby you my right now
If there was a scale from 1 to 10
Then my love for you is a million, billon
Boy, I’ll love you ‘til the day I’m dead
So please don’t mess with my head, please don’t mess with my head

[Chorus]

(I - don’t - know -- how - to - say it)

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
La-de-di, la-de-da
It’s the only way to love
La-de-di, la-de-da
It’s the only way to love
(To love, to love, to love, to love {4X})

[will] I don’t know how...

[Chorus]

[Outro: will.i.am]
La-de-di, la-de-da
It’s the only way you love
La-de-di, la-de-da
(I - don’t - know -- how - to - say it)

[Tank]
Oooh oooh

[Zane]
(I can never do too much)
Yeah, um, I know I been gone for a minute but tonight, I’m all yours

[Chorus - Tank]
Girl tonight, I’m yours
Turnin’ off my two-way
Turnin’ off my phone
I’ll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
Cause tonight I swear I’m all yours
(I can never do too much)

[Zane]
Our whole relationship is based on trust
And for you I can never do too much
You, kept me secrets and held me down
Plus you, stayed loyal when I wasn’t around
And I know it wasn’t easy, I was never home
Concerts, videos, and you was all alone
We spent many talkin’ on the phone
You started catchin attitudes
I heard it in yo tone
I used to tell I’ll be back when I could
You think I’d leave my babygirl in the hood
I would never do such thing
I wanna show you what true love brings
Im’a put you on a pedestal, love so incredible
Victoria Secret’s candy thong so edible
Spiritual, mental, not just sexual
I’ll deaden all my plans to get next to you

[Chorus]

[Zane]
I made reservations at your favorite spot
Pull up, tip the valet at the parking lot
Got a table by the fireplace, candlelit
Tonight, we gone stick to the manuscript
Start it out with a bottle of Cris, followed by a kiss
I can taste your lip gloss on my lips
So, candy sweet with your bubble gum tongue
The type of stuff that keep a brother straight sprung
And I try to play the tough guy role
And hold back but I’m losing control
When it comes to you I can’t explain how it feels
No more games baby, Zane is for real
You been askin’ for quality time, now you got it
Anything you want you can have, think about it
I been caught up in the hype so long
Now you never spend your nights alone
Cause daddy’s home

[Chorus]

[Tank]
All the love that you deserve I wanna give
And tonight I’ll show you its for you I feel
Everything I do is for you & I
So baby let’s ride

[Zane]
To the fellas
While you’re out on the grind
Don’t forget about your homefront
Spend some time with your lady
Or the next man will
If you dont treat her like a queen
You gone see what I mean
When’s the last time you told her how you felt inside
Held her hand and caressed her while you looked in her eyes
Let her know that she’s everything you need and more
For you my feelings are pure
And tonight, I’m all yours

[Chorus]

[Singer]
I had some problems
And I didn’t know how to solve them
Oh baby but you were the answer
I’ll be giving you all my token
I’m yours

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Rockie Fresh]
Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’
Yeah we rollin’, yeah we rollin’
We roll, we roll till we can’t roll no more
Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’
Yeah we rollin’, yeah we rollin’
We roll, we roll till we can’t roll no more

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I feel like pullin’ my whip out, start it up and just dip out
My old girl went M.I.A., so I’m a see what this new bitch ‘bout
We gon’ smoke, we gon’ chill she gettin’ shocked by the electric feel
She now a nigga stay fresh for real, see I got drive want to test the wheel
She gon’ give me that FaceTime, she gon’ go to that baseline
No name droppin’ I hate lying, I land in hit then I’m flyin’
To the future like Marty, still driving 88
When I’m pullin’ up to your party in coupe look like where are we
This is spaceship, take lift, come experience grey shit
But this fit for two so leave your friends we ain’t got no room
And bitch we cool don’t be talking all that goofy shit too soon
Matter fact don’t talk that at all, make a young nigga not get involved
Why, cause that shit be ridiculous, I’m a dog respect my viciousness
I’m a boss respect my business shit, talking money cause I’m really gettin’ it
Ballin’ with my niggas, while we travel state to state
Keep a lot up on my plate while we racing to the cake
Catch me...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Roll up with no tint, my old school is so mint
Score like I own the gym, your team so 0 for 10
All my hoes be OPM, they let me fuck, they don’t pay rent
I pay her bills with no regret, bitch must not know me yet
I’m that type that hop that flight, you say I can rip tonight
I be that vulture on the door step - mimosas and cold sex
Girl drop that Sebring, upgrade them bee stings
C cup, D cup, new closet, she needs things
She’s talented, only one, hold the gun, roll the blunt
Same time, roll the tongue, hand jobs, be number one
That’s right, pussy mine, ‘specially on that kush and wine
Pushin’ on that cushion now, [?]
I don’t care ‘bout your status ho, I just want me the baddest ho
But if she ain’t actin’ right then I’m a have to [?] this ho
Asking questions, wanna know, what’s that on the steering wheel
That’s the oak, lemme see them keys, crank it up, you know we still...

(It’s the REAL... HIP-HOP) Uh, Sycamore, none sicker than me
Studied EVERY jawn from EVERY NY emcee
I’m filthy raw, wise like the back of my jaw
Escobar, ill how I’m feelin by far
For the Tar Hills, bring the record deal to Car-olina

+Ether+ to the dome tried to blow him away
Motherfuckers wanna make it to some Queensbridge - Marcy shit
Believe me, New York, we don’t wanna spark this shit
We still be buildin’ these women and children
The whole shit will turn to Ground Zero if we start illin’
Look at Foxy and Tim what’s wrong with them
Both of them platinum, used to be bitches
Now they wanna give eachother stitches, damn
Is that how it is, when niggaz get riches
You got 50 with Ja, 50 with Jay
50 with anybody that get in 50 way
G-Unit, Jadakiss and Beanie

We know you nice for get you white just rep it right nigga
I look over at the westside

And make some real nigga wanna cry
It’s like niggaz forgot about Pac and B-I.
The only way to settle this; battle it out
1-0-6 in park and leave the gat at the house
If not ain’t no more to be yappin about
Get back to makin’ your joints ‘cause that’s what rap is about
Yo that shit is weak and all y’all niggaz know it
You can keep it on to lead it cause it’s just A Message From Poet
SAY WHAT
That shit is weak and all y’all niggaz know it
You can keep it on to lead it and this is just A Message From Poet
"Yeah y’all come on!"

[Intro: Timbo King]
United Kingdom... the UK
We’re bringing fire war
To those that oppose against the chosen

[Timbo King - Royal Fam]
As the sun rises, heat rays strikes the light geysers
Vision makes me see all snakes through their disguises
Who’s the wisest, you’ll be under, we’ll be overstanding
The four devils don’t exist in our cipher
We have to fight you, free from dumb, true and lighter
Knowledge provider, my limitation is above water
These are the days of the last quarter
Staying in tune, observing all aspects of life
Intelligent minds building electrical powerlines
Magnetic attracts metal made of steel
Disconnect your internet, burn corporate seals
Islams is shield, when we fight against satin
Allah you Akbar, time for revelations
I’ll bomb nations who deal with paganism
False teaching, were here to civilize a whole region
Right and exact, my brain contains inner, outer tissues
While you be popping pistols, we be launching nuclear missles
Crimson Tide, we react like Denzel
Murder verses creating more bars than in jail
Inhale and exhale, we prevail

[Snuggle-Up - C.O.I.N.S.]
Now
Money, you stole my rhyme, so why dont you just confess?
Your mouth will say no, but your body will say yes
Your ears’ll say i heard it, your feet: "I brung a beer"
The angel’ll find you quilty and award me the mayor
Internal flowing on a mountain thats blasted
So, cry for your lives and the fight is everlasting
Freeze, repent ladies and gents and save your spirit
Cuz once judgment comes, I aint trying to hear it
Suckers say, "aint nothing wrong, love is something long"
But nowadays hit the wrong button and your gone
Its written and caress about people having sex
If your holes too big, uhh shorty i’ll renig
A fig with milk, the Eifel Tower tilts
To roast MC’s thats why the Coin MC was built
My grandmom’s took a whole year to sew a quilt
It read, "a hard head leaves a soft tale"
So, when you cheat, you get a beating
I hope it rings a bell, one, two, I know you Power-U
This is a message to you and you and you

[Timbo King]
What? Yo
You fake moves like you play chess
Off with your head, yes, striking at night with a army vest
Test the mic with words that’s scientific
A chemist in a laboratory building off physics
I break you down, chopping you up in small pieces
My flows updated like pants without creases
Heat releases when energy is conducted
A forty block radius, the castle is constructed
My fam’s loyal, we stay royal just like Egyptians
I slam like Islam, my knowledge brings wisdom
I bomb you with plutanium, mixed with C-4
Fuck up your route and lane with a detour
You rap peasants, you dont impress my intelligence
Off with your head, pawn 4, no type of evidence
Case closed, legally, we be regally
Catapults hit direct, destroy the scenery

[Outro: Snuggle-Up, (Timbo King), *Killarmy sample in background*]
(What?, destroy the scenery, what?, y’all don’t want it)
You know what I mean?, my man Kruger’s even here
All of my other family’s here
You know who I’m talking about... the real cats,
the real kings, the real Gods, y’all dont want it
U.K., U.K., we’re gonna bring that in, y’all,
for the ‘98 and on, and on, we’re gonna bring that in, y’all
U.K., we rule, we’re taking out your kingdom
What?, for real, everything is ours
U.K., ‘98, word is bond
Peace to the Gods and Earths-Queens
Peace

[Chorus]
Old songs, old songs 
Old records, and old memories 
8 tracks, takin’ it back 
to, them old songs, olllld strong songs  

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
When you’re 35 or 40 
and you chillin wit yo’ shawty 
Whatchu gon’ listen to? Whatchu gon’ listen to
if you ain’t making nothin new?  
If ya wanna just sample
Well I\xc2\x92m tellin you, ya gamble  
You ain’t even writing one strong song  
You ain\xc2\x92t even writing nothing to hold on 
Late at night you wanna watch TV 
Lean back and play a lil’ Stevie (Stevie) 
Play the music, play the music 
Then you’ll know why I’m talkin ‘bout the 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
When you get a little older  
and your nights get a little bit colder  
Whatcha gon’ cuddle to? Whatcha gon’ cuddle to? 
Well it must be misty blue 
Tell me what you got on yo’ menu 
Serve it up, I know that it’s in you 
Serve it up, serve it up 
Serve it up serve it up serve it up 
Listen to the music that made you 
Tune in to what yo’ mama played ya 
Time to celebrate, time to create before, it’s too late
Oh, go to your favorite place  (Go to your favorite place)
Speakers bumpin, bumpin that bass (Speakers bumpin that bass)
Slow dance and what do they play? 
Betty and Teddy all up in yo’ face!

[Chorus]

[Rap verse: Betty Wright] 
I must admit yo’ beats got fatter 
But add subject matter on subjects that matter... 
Cause it matters, yeah it matters...

[Outro: Betty Wright] 
{*The chorus is sung in background until the end of the song*}
Hmmmm-mmmm
Patti, Gladys, Chaka Khan, Prince
And Kelly, and Kelly, and Kelly, and Kelly...

Hey, Erykah, little sista

Angie, C’MON Stone! Keep on writin and singin dem strong songs, ohh 
India.Arie, keep singin and playin for me 
Talk about that sweet tea and your sweetie 
Just, keep singing those songs 
Raheem and Jaheim and The-Dream and the whole team 
Just take me on back to those STRONG songs 
Joe and Mario and Ne-Yo and ohhh 
Keep on writing and singing them strong songs 
Just keep on listenin to Marvin, Aretha, The Isleys and them O’Jays  
So you’ll know what to say and you’ll know what to play

[ Richie Rich ]
Yo man, what we gon’ talk about next?
Man, you know what?
I think we should talk about these groupie-ass bitches
You know what I’m sayin?
As a matter of fact, Jed, guess who I seen the other day?
[ Jed ]
Who?
[ Richie Rich ]
Man, remember that bitch we seen up at that picnic
the one who was campin like she was down with Bobby Brown?
[ Jed ]
You mean that punk bitch that wish she were like on your album?
[ Richie Rich ]
Yeah man, I seen her the other day, man, down on the track
And guess what, the hoe was jockin the gold kick spins
[ Jed ]
D-Loc, we need to put somethin out for these fool bitches
and let em know what time it is, man
[ D-Loc ]
Man, it’s like this:
When a bitch fuck with a young vet like me I treat her shit

[ D-Loc ]
You know the silly bitches I don’t like
The Michael Jordan-New Edition-get with a star-type
I used to have one, with ass like a whale tail
Wanted to get on my team cause a nigga had mail
For those that don’t know, mail means money
But no, I don’t pay for pussy, honey
I might do the pimpin if you can do the dishin
Cause stackin up dollars is my number one ( ? )
In this society in which we’re livin
If you’re gonna have a bitch, you got to be spendin
So to the ladies on the b.s. tip
Sing along, fellas: you’re just a groupie-ass bitch

[ Richie Rich ]
Haha, that’s it
Let them hoes know
D-Loc, peep this out
I got with a bitch about a month ago
She ain’t called me yet
And I know when she peep the video
she gon’ be tryin to get with me
But what would you tell a punk-ass bitch like that?

[ D-Loc ]
Don’t even call, I played ya like a foul ball
In a month or two you’ll be through
Schemin on my label for a story or a fable
You just caught the vapors and nothin can save you
We used to be together on the 9 to 5
But when I stopped spendin money, you stopped spendin time
It’s sort of like a game, so the story goes
I was once told you reap what you sow
If that’s true, let me phrase this statement:
Suck my dick, cause I ain’t takin it
The stories, the lies, the alibis
You see, I’m only 19, but I’m livin the life
So to the girlies out there I can’t get with
Men, let’s come again: you’re just a groupie-ass bitch

(Cause a bitch is a) (biatch)
[ Richie Rich ]
Haha, let them hoes know
(Just another freak for the truz and vogues)

[ D-Loc ]
The subject of this object, if you object
Is to get my point across as clear and correct
As I can get when I’m talkin this shit
Therefore I must ensure explicit lyrics
Like: shit, bitch, fuck with this
Put your muthafuckin stankin-ass pussy on my dick
Ride it like a jockey in a horse race
You better get buck wild before I bust you in the fuckin face
I ain’t soft on a bitch, I’m quite mean
Fuckin up the doggy style with no grease
Peace to the homies if you know what I’m sayin
And if you don’t understand - you’re not a man
You’re just a hound loungin around
Waitin to sniff some dead presidents
I know the sex was just a collect
Men, I tell you, we gets no respect
Things can change if we do it our way
You see, in ‘89 a bitch was made to slave
So homies, for the last time, use your mind
Get a grip, boss, and like a pimp
Tell her to back off, cause she’s a groupie-ass bitch

(She’s the one)

[ Devin ]
Well, it’s me, that nigga D from the Odd Squad
Lettin you bitches know that we’ve been workin hard
We been puttin our hands together tryin to work hard on it
Cookin up a pot of soul, grab a bowl if you want it
Shit, we took our time but it’ll pay off at the end
Get all the money and all the hoes that we can stick our dicks in
You got Jugg Mugg, Devin, Rob M-a-c
Give us $15, you got a fat CD
But don’t depend on the radio cause all they play
Is DJ Snotty Nose and MC Don’t-Know-What-To-Say
And when we hear they shit, man, we laugh at them hoes
They musta got off the pipe but they started smokin mo’s
You need to get with the new crew and that’s the O-double
D down with the G.B. ‘makin trouble’
It took us a while to come out, but bitch
We wasn’t frontin, we here to tell you a lil’ somethin

( *DJ Styles cuts up* )
(Ain’t here for no frontin
just to say a little somethin)\t--> KRS-One

[ Rob Quest ]
Kniggedy-knock-knock-knock upon the door, don’t ask who is it
It’s them niggas from the Squad here to pay a fuckin visit
And I’m gonna thrust my vocal pon this fat track
I got the knack to make an old crippled white man rap black
Ugh, so give me some dap if you heard somethin that you liked
All I need is an EPS and a mic
What do I have to do to make you see the vivid picture?
I keep you full like a Timmy Chan wing dinner
Swingin these rhymes on a Texas style tip, trick
Fuckin these hoes with the Texas-sized dick
Another hit from the fly one
Lookin for a better nigga, you can’t find one
I have a beat quicker than you can get the rhyme done
But you better have my muthafuckin papes straight soon as I’m done
And that’s comin from the heart
Peace to them niggas from the Bone Hard ( ? )
And this is dedicated to my crew
And big black ass [Name] forgot about you, fool
Tighter than panty hoes that’s three sizes too small
Here’s the beeper number, bitch, so you can give a nigga a call
And I’m Audi like Five Star rims
DJ Styles, get on the cut and won’t you tell em

( *DJ Styles cuts up* )
(Ain’t here for no frontin
Just to say a little somethin)\t--> KRS-One

[ Jugg Mugg ]
On yeah, we’re new on the set but not considered as new jacks
A long time comin, now we’re puttin it in your back
Before we couldn’t come out with a dope-ass track
A nigga couldn’t wait to slap this bitch on wax
I’m here to say to all the rap musicians
The Squad’s in the house here to claim our positions
Because we’re Odd, yes hard
I pack a .357, so there’s no need for a bodyguard
Kickin the funky skills that we know’ll make your head bob
Just some potent muthafuckas outta Rap-A-Lot
So put the tape in, I bet you say it’s bumpin
Cause it’s about time that we told ya hoes somethin

( *DJ Styles cuts up* )
(So listen to what we say)\t--> Slick Rick
(Listen muthafuckas)

(Just to say a little somethin)
(So listen to what we say)

Made for television such a vision on the airwaves
Queen of melodrama she’s hotter than a sauna
And worth a million bucks I’m glad I had to wear a tux
Not so plain Jane damn what a creature
Mr. Keach I beseech you could you put me in your feature?
I’m not Tarzan and I’m sure no monkey
But you Jane and me Funky

"Quiet on the set better get into position people"
Talbott man shut up or they won’t call us back for the sequel
Allan’s looking bored Mac show me some chords
‘Cause Jane is looking cute and I don’t want to be ignored
Never knew how much it took to be a movie extra
Faking keys to no one will see surprisingly can test you
I’ve got a Jane-Jones but I ain’t no junkie
‘Cause you Jane and me Funky

Jane I want to see more Jane I want to see more (repeated)
‘Cause you Jane and Me Funky

Fingers on film I’ve got to make the final cut
But everyone on the set has got a stick up their butt
Lead man is straight stony Jane looks kind of bony
I’ve had it with movie magic man it makes me feel so phony
I ain’t Sony and y’all can’t play me like a Walkman
Every other extra on the set is trying to be a jock and
Get their little props but you can’t punk me
‘Cause you Jane and me Funky

(Repeat chorus until you throw up)

[Intro: Luke]
Yo this is a record about stars fakin like gangstas
Gangstas trying to be stars
Stars wanting to be ganstas but they really pranksters
So I had to get my man JT cause we the only true 2 ex=cons on staff 
And so we could kick it to you straight and not fake
Aiyyo JT kick it
 
[Verse One: JT Money]
Picture a nigga as raw as me, the motherfuckin J to the T
Tired of niggas saying how bad they are
Fronting like ganstas but I call em Gan-stars
Stars that want to be gangsters
but I’m from the real side not like Jekyell and Hyde
Bad boys don’t stay fuck niggas on the street
You see that ain’t me
Example niggas go to concerts fucked up
The next thing you know the niggas gettin chumped up
And they don’t look so tough to me
I guess niggas ain’t the same on and off TV
But not me I grab the mike and shoot game
And on the streets it’s the same motherfuckin thang
See I pop no bullshit
If you offended wear it if the motherfucking shoe fits
But still don’t have 2 left feet
Fuck around get your shit split to the white meat
Cause yall ain’t nothing but pranksters
Fuck niggas faking like ganstas.
 
[Luke]
I can’t stand a nigga talking about a gangsta
Nigga ain’t nothing but a motherfuckin prangsta
Nigga ain’t never been to jail
Bigga ain’t never put a cap in a nigga
Nigga just talking about dropping a nigga
cause he saw another nigga drop a nigga on TV
Aye yo JT kick example 2
 
[Verse 2: JT Money] 
Example 2, the neiborhood chump
Andy Gump came across a sawed off pump
I guess the niggas now longer a chump
cause now he talk shit and quick to pop the trunk
Young nigga got bad over night
Maybe that dumb shit got his ass hype
Walking around with a unit in the place
hanging with the big boys smoking lace
But his wall ain’t up to date
and I hate fuck niggas who perpetrate
Like niggas makin love songs first
next time you see em all they do us curse
Talkin bout the niggas they kill
1st they was lovas now they trying be real
And for the ones talking bout the whiteman
Ever told your fans whos your bossman?
I guess that makes yall prankstas
fuck niggas fakin like gangstas!
 
[Luke] 
Fuck niggas you got me worried, yes you got me worried
Because first of all yall talkin this black shit, black this black that
The whiteman’s still collecting yo motherfucking paycheck
You ain’t told yo motherfucking fans that
It’s a whole different tale about niggas who getting it like this
 
"Real niggas" Faking like gangstas
"Real niggas" Faking like gangstas
"You guys know who I’m talking to...Ohhh! (NWA)
 
[Verse 3: JT Money]
None of them fuck niggas ever did time
but while it’s on my mind
We got up 4 in the morning fo cold eggs and grits
Jim Jones and doodoo on a stick
Niggas had to eat this shit everyday
and one nigga got shanked up for a tray
And you gotta have your set up to date
while niggas be scrapping fo a place
And nobody snitches
Cause snitches get stiches fo talking like bitches!
They wouldnt last cause they prankstas
cunt niggas faking like gangstas

.
.
[Verse 1]
Yo, bear my black underbelly to the wind
I got an itch I can’t scratch between my thorax and my abdomen
Lit my tail end with the fire to give us purpose
But I’m cursed by this short circuit below the surface
Nervous when I glow ‘cause I always go dim
Like the breath of a torch light suffocating without oxygen
Wanna burn bright so the kids can catch a spark
Illuminate the space between grace and broken hearts
Inspire the human race to chase something set apart
The sky of firefly as I blow by to split the dark
But the spark fades and the blaze burns cold
Left most of the children with nothing to hold
Except the grip of what they thought they had caught
but came to doubt
I tried to firefly but in the end just flickered out
Six limbs, two wings, one vision to shine bright
But my city on the hill just spilled into the night

[Chorus] X 2
I wanna fill the sky with fire when I fly
Higher than the heavens just a twinkle in your eye
I walk the tight wire just to serve my own desire
I tried to firefly but in the end just flickered out

[Verse 2]
Escape the thin pocket of air beneath my Nikes
Might the night flicker bright to the beat of my wing flight
Or it might just not fall off the blown spot
Cat walk in the dark to the down beat
To the uprock quick to the don’t stop
Talk love but spit hate
Don’t do what I wanna do with every move I make
Cause I shake with my left and I take what I write
Speak life with my lips but then diss on the Mic
I’m swift to be angry but then I’m slow to be quiet
The trouble with the puddle of my life is double sided
So I struggle to keep the purpose of the lamp of my life lighted
Keep this lightening bug plugged with the Christ till I’m like-minded 
Till I burn with the fire than inspires the world-wided
And glide upon the spark of the sun till dark’s blinded
And dart till dawn upon the lawn to be reminded
That our faith isn’t gone but sometimes we can’t find it

[Chorus] X 3

[Chorus: Stic man]
I know I can, I’m sure I can
get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I’m sure I can break free from the chains

[Verse 1: Stic man]
I can heal, I can change a fight and never give up
I’d made up my mind I can do it and that’s what up
I’m a learn I’m a find what I need to help myself
I understand that it’s up to me to take care of my health
I’m a prove to the world that I can get back up
on my feet and I’m a do it for myself for me
and for my family, they only want the best for me
they wonna see me in control of my destiny

[Chorus: Stic man]
And I believe I can
I know I can, I’m sure I can
get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I’m sure I can break free from the chains

[Verse 2: Stic man]
Aint no easy way out, but I made it this far
many days I slip back frustrated cos it’s hard
but it’s my time now to make the changes in my heart
And I aint looking back right here today is where I’m a start
I believe in myself, I just made some bad choises
I still love myself and I aint ready for the coffin
I’m reaching out to my loved ones for they support
and no negative thought is gonna stop me just (watch)

[Chorus: Stic man]
I believe I can
I know I can, I’m sure I can
get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I’m sure I can break free from the chains

[Verse 3: Stic man]
I got things I wonna do in my life I aint did yet
I know I’ve been close to the egde but I aint dead yet
it’s never too late to make a change for the better
and I really mean it this time I’m bout to get myself together
I know it’s not just me I aint the only one
everybody got something that they need to overcome
you aint gor to smoke crack to be a fiend
a fiend is just somebody whos addicted it can be anything
too many of us addicted to the American dream
we high from the lies on the TV screen
we drunk from the poison that they teach in the schools
and we junkies from the chemicals we eat in the food

[Chorus: Stic man]
I believe I can
I know I can, I’m sure I can
get this dope out my veins
I believe I can, I know I can
I’m sure I can break free from the chains

[Speach: Stic man’s mum]
I believe in myself
I believe that greater is in me, than is on the outside
I can be ... who I wonna be
It’s already inside me, if I just believe in myself

[M-1]
Promote this, sat back and wrote this
Rhyme about the hopeless, add it to ya quote list
Don’t miss the African rise, before you eyes, it won’t be televised
And if it is, they prolly telling lies, to hold us back
It don’t take a nation of millions, it take crack
And black folks selling the black
That’s the game all over the world, we the same
All over the world, we the same muthafuckas

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Aiyo, I cultivate the soil of the mind like a farmer
I make it evident, heaven’s a slame man’s karma
The charmer the serpent, the bomber of the merchant
Who will once exile savages in caves lurking
A black house divided, won’t stand religion’s mental prison
Life is mathematics, devils conquer with division
The black man’s the numerator, black woman denominator
Once they been divided, the black child is the reminder

[Chorus: M-1]
Who said street niggas ain’t got no class
This whole society divided by class, the rich cracker
Is the ruling class, the rich niggas is the middle class
And you and I make up the working class
Every man fall somewhere within his own certain class
And from the way things is looking, dun, we certain to clash
Scattered people, we all the same

[Sticman]
Yo, Puerto Ricans is poor people, they Africans too
So is Jamaica, and I ain’t saying nothing that’s new
Aiyo, the Mexican land, got pyramids like Egypt
Same tree, same root, son, you best believe it

[M-1]
The ghetto is a prison with invisible bars
Politicians know the problems, but they never get solved
They got us working like slaves at these capitalist jobs
Putting food on they tables, while our neighborhoods starve

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Word, I know ya’ll feel a certain climate
What we deal wit is culture refinement
We raise the dead before the vultures find it
I raise an ultraviolet, we on a kosher diet
I’m marching with the peoples army, son, we multiply it

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook/Scratches]
"Funkoars" "Drunk mother fuckers"

[Verse One: Hunter]
Up the creek without a paddle but we got Funkoars
Where’s my beer? Cunt we drunk yours!
Sons of wars, I’m breaking tons of laws
It’s fucking Hunts of course putting runs on the board
Like Langer at a test match, I’m taking the best catch
I check out the face, the tits, and then snatch
I always wear a rubber so the eggs don’t hatch
I needed some funk and Oar’s had a new batch
I scored well for it and got amphetimized
then crossed the Nullarbor to hang with Certified Wise
Losing sanity on a thirty hour drive
Hip hop’s the only reason that I’m still alive 

[Verse 2: Trials]
I’m that dude in the back of the club, slashed like fuck 
With my head nearly touching my gut, throwing shit up
It’s the Oars of funk and we just started getting drunk
Blowing chunks, hooded up like a Gregorian Monk
The Funkorian’s buff so keep rubbing if you’re feeling me
Mr T, fat enough to claim a disability
Ain’t a cat alive dumb enough to test us
I serve you the two round two through John Edwards
My style is wrecking mics and stylists
My rhyme moves the hearts of tarts like Saconian diamonds
These tracks turn heads like Linda Blair naked
I say a lot of dumb shit but never try to take it back
like a face lift, mistaken if you fake it
Face it, we rock the place like sumo weigh ins
We rock spots like chicken pox and savages
Massacres, breaking shit down like bad marriages

[Hook/Scratches]
"Funkoars" "Drunk mother fuckers"

(And what if Hons was one of us?)

[Verse 3: Hons]
Well there then we’d have a world full of perverts and verse plus beat precision
Hons will pull your car like a fucking street magician
Think that’s dope? Well here’s the best part
Raps are that fat my punchlines develop fucking stretch marks
It’s the Oars and Hunter
Full of drunk mother fuckers, down the pints ‘til we chunder
Sucker, we bust through and crush crews
The Funkoars get rotation like we released a bus loop
Sketchy Hons a certified trend setter
Never sell out cos underground groupies give head better
So make way for the mad sketchy cunt
I’m the type of guy that buys a sports car just to fuck a empty(?) slut
I’ll test your luck when I’m gripping a mic 
And I ain’t a fan of red so paint your town Certified

[Verse 4: Sesta]
Never brag, never had to
Never boast cos I know the show is over once we get off the stage
between me and the bar and then you best get out the way
After a bottle of Johnny couldn’t stop me
Putting the barricade of hottie boddies in line until they told me whether
I rap here or Perth, Melbourne or Sydney
Never rap for the attention, I’m here to get her tipsy
See, I’m gonna need a hand in Canberra and I don’t even want to be able to stand up
Drunk with drinks and they’re gone and hell will have to fill me like a sober Funkoar
Don’t aim when I piss but I rap when I’m pissed
Slight laminated lyrics but I’m still able to rip it up
You need a lesson in rap, I’ll show you how Oars keep it raw
Only sell out here’s the crowd

[Hook/Scratches]

Dirty Southside, got your mouth wide open
Cross eyed all tongue tied, like you on formaldehyde
If you not qualified, I’ll hit from the blind side
Lives getting crucified, we cried when Aaliyah died
It’s just Southern pride, inside and outside
Never ever satisfied, until we heard worldwide
Some people done lied, told you that we countrified
Got you all buck eyed, and looking at our clean ride
If you not preoccupied, grab a seat court side
Watch the show all high, we got chicken Southern fried
Let me be your tour guide, up the South and Northside
And put the plex aside, we got the game hogg tied
Hard-core and bonefied, our ice and piece dried
Roaches get pesticide, we won’t be denied
Playa I reside, on the Southside
Is where you see the drop top Bentley outside

[Hook]
What you boys know, about the Dirty South
Where we stay iced up, and pull Bentleys out
What you boys know about that Lone Star state
Where the homies slowing it, ?and the rest concade?
What you boys know, about them Texas boys
We the ones Down South, making all the noise
What you boys know, about that S.U.C.
This for Screw and Mafio, and P-A-T

[H.A.W.K.]
On tracks and eight dats, I break backs and spit facts
Squash all chit-chat, and bullshit I ain’t with that
I keep thangs intact, cause my goal is that
The studio’s my habitat, your flow is whack can’t get in that
I two-way my contact, tall stacks with Cold Jack
Like you cats can’t get it back, and my ? so you rugrats
I’m doing this for Fat Pat, and for him I bring that
At first I use to slang crack, now it’s two ties and slacks
All dogs and stray cats, pimps, playas and macks
Niggas down like fo’ flats, with bald fades and flats
We want it all like ball brass, down here we tote gats
Our body’s covered with tats, we only smoke ball bats
That’s how we do it, get the stash we screw it
We arch you to it, like Nike just do it
You had a chance you blew it, so now it’s my turn
If you not from round here, you boys will learn that

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
Southern hard hitter go-getter, never been a quitter
Hardest pit in the litter, got these haters bitter
See the way my chain glitter, this is for my real niggas
Who stack the figgas, and will pull the triggas
I’m buttoned up like silver, my name is getting bigger
I’m not your average nigga, and I’m raw like Digga
Southern flow spitter, don’t mess with quitters
Or no wig splitter, and I’m giving cats the chills
What boys know, bout eggs and grits
Smashing hits, and girls I hit it with big tits
What you boys know, bout starchy jeans
And serving fiends, and moving bricks for nineteen
What you boys know, bout brand new whips
Unloading the clips, and country boys bout they chips
What you boys know, bout moving snow
I’m not just glow, in the Dirty South cats get thoed

[Kool G. Rap]
No doubt
The real drama shit

All ya rap niggas pay homage
When he raps, spit atomics
When verse crash the Earth like a comet
Raise a prophet, make hot lava spit out like vomit
We Vietnam it, scramble ya brain like an omelette
Spling baby link the bomb it, keep you reek niggas in bondage
A convicts we Allah, then we bomb it
We trom it, it take a Terror Squad to dis arm it
We layin with grenades in our palms, two hours longer

[Big Punisher]
Ah shit nigga, you got me started momma one of the good boys
Said she got a 400 pound retarted Bronx nigga from the Projects
What nigga you don’t want it, cock figga figga got it
You make me sick, fuckin wit Pun, youse a crazy bitch
Hold him for ransom, or cut off his tongue in cause he itchin
80 stitches across cheak, 70 more for talkin cheap
A buck 50 even nigga, that’s regulation on the street

{yo and come on scratched}

"No man can go against me!"

{more scratchin}

"You don’t stop me"

[Kool G. Rap]
Probaly socks soes inside the trenches
Closin in for miles to inches, killin the distance, enemy flinches
Death finces left for kid limus
Made mine behind the barb wire fences
Crossfire tent winters
Saw my man blow, bandana tied tight like Rambo
Burn a slug make the land glow
Niggas screamin for medics and ammo
Every soldier in your camp go

[Big Punisher]
Me and my man Joe got ya back
AKA Joey Crack, AK with the mack, makin my to the pack
Everyday I gotta be strapped, cuz niggas don’t know how to act
You don’t wanna go the gap, cuz T-Squad gonna react
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos
Just in case you comin Commando
I’m a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies
And a couple of morrenos that’ll die for me

[Kool G. Rap]
Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take jars
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge
Killas are large, my two trade pound gauge will sound hard
For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard

[Big Punisher]
That’s a pound dog bout to get down and put the work
Try the jury but it wouldn’t work, skit but it wouldn’t merk
He glass, no glass, think fast yo ass too late, muthafucka
Put a d-rap too fast

{scratches}

"Act like you want Drama"
\t"Kool G. Rap"
"Big Pun"
\t"X-Executioners style"

(Sheek Luciano)
Yo, I’m the same nigga that when I get locked up
I don’t call no nigga to bail me out
(Jadakiss)
(McGruff)
Yo, let me sit for a while, man
(Ty)
I wanna get acquainted with niggas
I’m ready to blow niggas down for the jack
(Uptown)
Whatever
(Yonkers
Harlem)

[ VERSE 1: Jadakiss ]
Yo, it wouldn’t be wise to play this guy
But let’s say you tried, it’d be the day you die
I’m Jay to the - mmpfaah, callin ya on love tat, baby
And all I see is payday, y’all niggas ain’t crazy
Frontin like you big, but I run with them kids
That’ll poke one in your ribs, leave you under the bridge
It’s a money thing, and a little bit
Make niggas forget about they youth, like they bulletproof
Doin deals in benegans with Dominicans
But my transporter’s a bad West Indian
I always knew I had butter, but I never found it
When your style be like the law, cause I get around it

[ VERSE 2: Styles ]
Aiyo respect comes first, send it throughout the barrel
Bullets travel - until you hit the gravel
Every week’s a war for sure, so I adore
Those who keep the toast close, mi amor
Audi 840, gettin floored for raw
And the streets come first, I can teach you more
Like if I knew you had bricks, I’d be kickin your door
I’ma rob em with Guess jeans and Air Max jogs
Only one page, you ain’t ready for the saga
In it for the dough, flow hotter than lava
‘Livin Off Experience’ layin low like the Nigerians
Cut like a cesarean

[ VERSE 3: Sheek ]
Yo, if I can’t afford ???, how you figure I could write a rhyme?
Or do crime and hustle and still struggle at the same time
Stay wonderin when the next time we might eat
We pack heat and run from police like a track meet
I’m tryin to acquire the cheddar to make my life better
Rock Gucci sweaters, push Beamers with the headers
But right now ain’t nothin lavish for my members
In and out of jail for the past 2 Decembers
I even seen a kingpin get stripped naked in Sing-Sing
Used to be a thug, but in jail he’s somebody thing-thing
I ain’t tryin to look jiggy when I’m runnin from Miss Piggy
Cause fancy niggas get extorted kinda quickly in the city

[ VERSE 4: McGruff ]
Puff ‘dro from the _High Times_
Committin organized crimes
Ski mask disguise mine
Slid by the guidelines
Bust off like fire nines
Stalk, I shine, frauds talkin jive rhymes
Get they earth took, nigga frontin like Herb shook
The dirt book, run with thirst crooks, 8th and the 3rd look
Word look, smoke you like purple hayze herb cook
Caught a pie from these oyeys on my first jook
Fuck it, yo, life’s a bitch, gotta love it though
All I ever wanted was knots and buck the flow
Have a mansion, dope parties with a tubble-mo
You know how the shit goes
Fly hoes strip clothes and my kitkos

Uh, yeah
Y-O
King Phaze
Yonkers {{echoed}}

[King Phaze]\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

By the time I get done, they caskets closed (Come On)
And it won’t take me ten years to be the next Hov (What)
Mixed with Metallica, sick of amateurs 
Rappin over guitars, like they could damage it
This ain’t the Jay-Z/Linkin Park Collision Course
This the 80 car collision rock rap intercourse

Straight out of Yonkers, I conquered and did my thing (Y-O)

Mentally I’m unstable, and I’m so capable
Showin you what the razor do

[Chorus: 2x]
Yonkers {{echoed}}

Lettin the mack pop, still on the back block
Know that you’re dead first second your hat drop (You’re dead, yeah)
Line ‘em up, I annihilate ‘em
Hard like the white boys that listen to Iron Maiden (What up)
Hoppin in the mosh pit, leavin with the iron blazin (I’m leavin)
I’m the motherfuckin highest patient
Ask Phaze that I can’t be fazed (What up Phaze)
It ain’t a phaze, knock rocks while we blowin the haze
It gets deeper when we come
Got the devil on the guitar, the reaper on the drum (It’s deep)
And I’m a motherfuckin wild nigga (I’m wild)
Son of Sam, or the forty-four coward killer
So let me know when you ready (I’m ready)

[Chorus]

Weed everywhere (uh huh) coke to the fuckin ceiling (Let’s go)
Bitches sniffin, neighbors riffin (It’s ok)
Smoke comin out the door when I light up my piffin
Tommy Lee, nah this Donnie G (Sheek Louch)
Don Gorilla, X, King Phaze and P (Let’s Go)
Blacked out Night Rider in the SRT
One deep with the range it could fit all three (Let’s go baby)
I ain’t seen a nigga hidin till I look in the mirror
I’m an ol’ skool baller like Yogi Berra
Potato on the gun make it hard to hear ‘em
I run this shit I can’t say it more clearer (Y-O)
Bookbags, spray paint black marker (Hip-Hop)
I’m tattooed up like Travis Barker
Y’all funny muh’fuckers like Meet the Fockers (Ha ha)

[Chorus: 2x]

[DMX]

Understood, there’s nothing to bang for the cause (Uh)
And I could cause you couldn’t bang with the fours (Come on)
Home of the brave nigga, take it to the grave nigga

Start off from School Street, aight let’s roll (Come on)
Goin up ahead, up Palisades, hit the hole (Bap)

Smoke only strong weed
Roll only long weed
Fine ass big haze

Weed all in my eyes, I’m finna cry
Weed in the brownie pies, Miley high
They trim and cut my iry

Ya’ll niggas monkeys so I’m bout to go bananas
Everything I write flip flop, yea trumpet killin
Put deuces in the Phantom, west side of Atlanta
And the same nigga told you buy sell em and I’m sellin those
Uh, getting head in a buggy

Bitch I want my number back, your pussy musty
Fuck that bitch, trust me

[Chorus]

Talkin to me, got her run it back

Roll up a ball bat

Where the fuck ya’ll at?

Smoking out the back of cars
Man we just a bunch of stars
Black kush up in my cigars

[Intro] [Phonte talking]
Yo, check it out right now. Bringin’ it to you once again
live and direct to you and yours, it’s Phonte from Little Brother
Peace to my mans Big Pooh and 9th Wonder
My man Grap Luva. K Brown on the track. We gonna set it like this yo

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Yo for 2003
Beats and rhymes so arising in me
Feelin’ all of God’s blessings as they showering me
Makin’ my voice pro-ject like public housin’, and we
Grap Luva and K Brown gonna give you somethin’ to see
Tay’s in the game now, what’s nothin’ to me?
Nigga claim they have my back, sound like they was frontin’ with me
With fake smiles and uneasy glances
Lookin’ at me like I’m the nigga who upset their chances
Out in the game gettin’ stepped on and still tryin’ to press on
C’mon niggas
You just wack fucker, you ain’t gettin’ slept on
And I ain’t tryin’ to be foul or stuck up
But you gotta know when to call it quits
Tell your man to pull the truck up
Break the studio down and go and call your cuz up
Another beat machine you don’t never need to plug up
That nigga Tay is known to bring the ruckus
Still takin’ time to write rhymes and learn lessons from my fuck ups

[Grap Luva]
Don’t loose sight of the picture
Peep the scripture
In my possession is the ultra elixir 
Feel the healin’ y’all
These contents, yo, they never under pressure
Had ‘em fooled, thinkin’ you was greater and I was lesser
Please
Kid you better refocus yourself quick
Comin’ at me all slick, you need to dead that shit
I’m here standin’ firm, reppin’ this straight from the heart
With Phonte we rip the party apart
(Chill, don’t spill your drinks cousin)
We make you boogie up in Hammerstein
Where people clamor just to hear our rhymes
Spittin’ these lines, simply designed
What’s sonically right
We know you feelin’ it
Fiendin’ for Kev’s sound but for now you just VIBE

[Chorus] [Phonte]
All across the globe we make the people say
(Oooh yeah)
And up in the club we make the ladies say
(Alright)
Showin’ love on the track and take the hate away
(Alright)
For everybody maintainin’ on the day to day
Y’all just can’t stay away
we make the people say
(Oooh yeah)
And up in the club we make the ladies say
(Alright)
Showin’ love on the track and take the hate away
(Alright)
Maintainin’ cause I just can’t stay away

You could hear the ‘oof beats pound
As they raced across the ground
And the clatter of the wheels
As they spun ‘round and ‘round
And he galloped into Market Street
His badge upon his chest
His name was Ernie
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

Now Ernie loved a widow
A lady known as Sue
She lived all alone in Linley Lane
At number twenty-two
They said she was too good for him
She was haughty, proud and chic
But Ernie got his cocoa there
Three times every week
They called him Ernie (Ernie)
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

She said she’d like to bathe in milk
He said "alright sweetheart"
And when he finished work one night
He loaded up the cart
He said "Do you wanted pasturised?
‘Cause pasturised is best"
She says "Ernie I’ll be happy
If it comes up to me chest"
And that tickled old Ernie (Ernie)
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

(Ahhh-oooooo)

Now Ernie had a rival
An evil looking man
Called Two Ton Ted from Teddington
And he drove the baker’s van
He tempted her with his treacle tarts
And his tasty wholemeal bread
And when she saw the size
Of his hot meat pies
It very near turned her head
She nearly swooned at his macaroon
And he said "Now if you treat me right
You’ll have hot rolls every morning
And crumpets every night"
He knew once she’d sampled his layer cake
He’d have his wicked way
And all Ernie had to offer
Was a pint of milk a day
Poor Ernie (Ernie)
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

(Ahhh-oooooo)

One lunchtime Ted saw Ernie’s ‘orse and cart outside her door
It drove him mad to find it was still there at half past four
And as he leaped down from of his van
Hot blood through his veins did course
And he went across to Ernie’s cart
And he didn’t ‘arf kick his ‘orse
Who’s name was Trigger (Trigger)
And he pulled the fastest milkcart in the west

Now Ernie rushed out into the street
His goldtop in his hand
He said "If you want to marry Susie
You’ll fight for her like a man"
"Oh why don’t we play cards for her?", he sneeringly replied
"And just to make it interesting
We’ll have a shilling on the side"
Now Ernie dragged him from his van
And beneath the blazing sun
They stood there face to face
And Ted went for his bun
But Ernie was to quick
Things didn’t go the way Ted planned
And a strawberry flavoured yoghurt
Sent it spinning from his hand

Now Sue she ran between them
And tried to keep them apart
And Ernie pushed her aside
And a rock cake caught him underneath his heart
And he looked up in pained surprise
As the concrete hardened crust
Of a stale pork pie caught him in the eye
And Ernie bit the dust
Poor Ernie (Ernie)
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

Ernie was only fifty-two, he didn’t want to die
Now he’s gone to make deliveries
In that milkround in the sky
Where the customers are angels
And ferocious dogs are banned
And a milkman’s life is full of fun
In that fairy dairy land
But a woman’s needs are many fold
And Sue she married Ted
But strange things happened on their wedding night
As they lay in their bed
Was that the trees a rustling?
Or the ‘inges of the gate?
Or Ernie’s ghostly goldtop a-rattling in their crate?
They won’t forget Ernie (Ernie)
And he drove the fastest milkcart in the west

When I be coolin, man look
I just be coolin

Or ain’t nobody to be foolin, yo
Listen to the words that I be sayin
Cos, when I’m on the mic there won’t be no delayin
I say yes yes y’all
To the beat y’all
Look in here, everybody in the house, havin a ball

Catchin the vibe from everybody
Feelin alright again
Rollin with my buds, Double I to the end

Chorus-X4
Hey alright, right, right

[Fam *singing*]
I said you ain’t a really down, really down
You ain’t down with my crew
You ain’t down with my crew
Check it out
I said you ain’t a really down, really down
You don’t do what we do
You don’t do what we do

[Fam]
Isn’t it beautiful, lovely, the vibe that I’m feelin
Cos my style is so appealin
Got you jumpin to the ceilin
I’m back, in fact I never went nowhere, my man
This track, is Boogie’s and he hand it down to Fam
You don’t understand, you could never underhand
The wonder man
Comin from the under land
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
Under the circumstance, huh
I order you to dance
It’s a Naughty-Rottin thing goin on tonight
If you wanna join in, everything’s alright
I’m quite tight
Tip-top shape for the night
Nothin’s gonna stop us now, no way in a right
Right you are
Who’s gonna stop a shootin star?
Whose aim is to go far
Like the milage on a car
This is for all o’ y’all to enjoy
Every man and woman, every girl and boy
Boy, oh boy

Chorus-X8

[Fam]
Yo, I got eight wheels
I wanna roll
Or might go to the rink
And get my stoll on
K-Boggie is the man behind the scenes that makes you move
Ill Town, Ill Town, ain’t got nuttin to prove
Wake up every mornin with my boom box blastin
It’s you that I’m askin
"What the hell’s been happenin"
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They’re stuck in regardless
When the radio didn’t want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

Chorus-X8

Cave men! [You better hush!] Cave women! [Hush!] And the... [Hush!]
Troglodytes! [Gun shot.]

[Somebody’s calling my name....]

[Brother J]
Ah, yeah! Ah, come on, come on, come on!

[Professor X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[Brother J] Uh, to the East, my brother, to the East! Come on!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] To the East, my brother, to the East, yeah!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] To the East, my brother, to the East, my brother, to the East, my
brother, to the East, my brother, to the East, my brother, to the East!

[Professor X]
Yes! I’m that kind of nigga
The one you fear, be scared you can’t figger
The one that has the finger on the trigger, boom!
In the cut of zoom
In the darkness, the halo, the moon!
Stepping ta’ ya’ real soon
Ah! Check the blackness!
Me before those enter the lightness!
Masturbating!
Masquerading!
And you call your self righteous?
Follow me!
A peripheral, missionary, and ark commit-ness
Having intercourse with the nation of darkness!
Books with worms!
Jherri suited with last names like perms!
niggas, get your hands of your cracks, come to terms with yourself
If you don’t get any bigger
Pink Caddy driving, black boot stomping
Yes! I’m that kind of nigga
Brother J, whatcha’ say?
Brother J, Brother J, whatcha’ say?
Brother J, whatcha’ say? Brother J, whatcha’ say?

[Brother J]
Yeah!
I’m just a pro-Black nigga, and I’m doing this
And yet you watch me, clock me, to see if I continue this
In the ways of the Caddy I survive like a pimp
No jherri curls, waves, perms, or crimps
The ever-nappy crew setting the mood
I raise my fuel for my firm attitude
Walking through the streets with my war cry spear
Certain folks know it means doom when they hear
My firm, black boots with no spurs attached
Now let me take a second, cause I might detach
My black boots if you confuse
I lose my peoples in the words you choose
For writer was wrong, or, man, what you think?
Accept my Black, so how the hell you diss Pink?
And yet you wanna’ be down, clown
So many wanna’ be down, with the illogical ark
Steppin’ through your cave-boy crew
Your nest of war, with your bald hair-do!
Media weapons!
News at 11!
Paper at 6 or systematic tricks
And that’s why I do what I do
Say how I feel so you get it on the real
True, true, any rapper will subdue
Try to test some buddy business
And submit my whole crew
The front page, says outrage
There’s no gauge, cause it’s time for the MAC!
Tune in your radio, video, stereo and all that
To the vibes of the pro-Black
It’s like that as I wind up my wrist
Check out the smack of the scientific fist
But on a level to the East I go
Cause with Freedom or Death, there’s no choice, you know?
Still on the topic of the P-R-O
When I pass my verbs, stick to brother P-X-O

[Professor X]
Over and under as I progress to this
Got no time to be hanging out with humanists
Raise a flag, fly the, tag the hand, clutch the fist
Serve we nationally comes the diss
Humanity keep it with us we break edicts
Milwaukee, the brutality, how can you dismiss?
So, off to the road we go you know
Follow the pro-nigga flow
Off to the road you know we go
Follow the pro-nigga flow
For you and yours, legislation
Past-purpose agitation
By way of the old ??? emancipation
Zoom, zoom, zoom revelation
Cometh pro-Black dedication
The solution: revolution
Evolution
The conclusion: the trigger!
Please, a let me take a swigger
And if you don’t get any bigger
Yes, I’m that kind of nigga!

[J] Yeah! To the East, my brother, to the East!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] Come on! To the East, my brother, to the East! Yeah!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] To the East, my brother, to the East! Yeah!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East, my brother, 
to the East, my brother, to the East!

[Brother J]
Yeah!
Revolution, evolution, the solution
No amendments, and burn the Constitution
You take the authors, a bunch of old wig-ers
Who ratified extinction of the poor, Black niggas
Know why? Cause I’m that nigga that they can’t stand
That teach an African how to say, "Black man!"
And I’m that nigga they can plainly see
With the nationalist colors of the red, black, green
Yeah! I’m the one who cut Tarzan’s vine
Ran his ass out the jungle with his homeboy swine
One of those brothers that they just can’t find
That makes ‘em shake and make ‘em shiver when it comes nighttime
Yeah! A boom-bap with a pro-Black slap
The old systematic dues
All Irish do Japs. Yeah!
You hear me? Boy, you’d better make way!
Enough action and totally nothing to say
And here’s a message to the Rainbow crew
And their fearless leader, Captain Human:
Revolution is not humanism!
Individualism and not separatism!
Hey! Point blank, living-ism is a tank
Cause there’s just some things that I never forget:
I remember green suits on a Black mayor;
I remember nine-millimeter child slayers;
I remember all the times that you called me an animal
But in Milwaukee there’s a cannibal
Check it! Some of the things that you just don’t figure
Cause it gets a lot Blacker and a whole lot bigger
No matter, nightstick or bring your big trigger
Our nation is protected by some pro-Black niggas!

[Professor X]
Making note of some minors. I’m not talking baseball, cause if I was
Brother J, we’d be playing professional. There nine innings to a
baseball game. By the way: Is it humanity? Or is it vanity?
Vainglorious! This is protected, by the red, the black, and the
green, with the key! On the road again. Sissy! And ya’ don’t stop!

[Pro the Leader]
Easily maneuvering through flows
Here to assassinate the president with a shot to his temple
No one can take me out with subliminal messages
Carrying rocket launchers in leather packages
Delivering time bombs in over night packages
Making my way through dark stair cases and mental passages
Unfasten your skull with electro-magnet
Fuck classic, my rhymes will be antique
Definitely unique, incredible, unforgettable, like Nat King Cole
Professional is Sobretti...
I got a claw hand, stick a knife in your abdomen like Freddy
And we got Warcloud in the house, Professional ‘bout to turn the party out
I used to do heroin, dilute it then I snort it
Stick it to aluminum foil and watch me smoke it
Strait dope addict, attracted to acid
Thinking its a nice day to walk out to the middle of traffic
Slam my 40oz down just to watch the glass shatter
Shape-shifter, technique mind over matter
A multitude of tracers appearing from the asphalt vapors
Decimating you haters, creating craters
Nearly perfect sentence structure, microphone alien abductor
Tear this whole shit down
Percussion destination got you facing elimination in my town...
Mother Fucker (WARCLOUD!) Mother Fuckers...

[Holocaust]
I live in a hollowed out asteroid, its WARCLOUD!
Better living through circuitry, Paleolithic surgery
Half man, half planet Mercury, I hurt MC’s
One day it rained and the people began to melt
Release the angles in the Euphrates River who sleep
To slay a third of Earth’s population for vindication
A dirty helicopter, my blades are my swords
When I descend upon you the sound of a zillion chariots
Nightmare room of truth cause it’s the scariest
Men made of heads who eat inside the lake
Shadowless zombie swordsmen, chills
Swoop up on you and launch your head in the hills
Sword mechanic tragic, mastermind Jurassic
Laughing outnumbered, leave you bloody construction yard
Shatter spirit shields with lyric fields
A one armed ghost samurai from the past that murdered un-Godly
The thunder struck oddly, I blast a dusty shotty
Three gauged hideous slump your carcass the grittiest
Angry wood cutters, shoulder fins, motion switch
Blizzard kicks break soundwaves and astounds slaves
Dirty mauler meat market massacre, mirage
Crash the like the hammer of the Gods and leave you lodged
Under heavy doors explore these warlords
Mystic paradise, my axe closet with shovels in it...
9 million ninjas fall upon you with light sabers
Cannibalistic neighbors, Ghost Pirates and heartless Raiders
Old gator man who is seldom seen
He lives in a cave made of moths with dusty wings...

[Road Block]
Stratospheric absorption, Anubis is deadly bomb like abortion
MC’s is fetal fecal material, in Laboratory trial with evolving styles
Manipulating to mutation, for this they blame the game, I’m blaming the nation
Through Astral concentration, The Mars surface is a hype service
Secret bleed trinkets, wipe your memories, clean slate
Roadblock stuck in the path, pause the mind state
My razor strait steaks, crack chest bones
Sewn to cenobites, held club fights with Tyler Durden
I been a high hermit, avert my pervert
My nerves hurt from rappers that ‘Jabber Jaw’
I’m raw, Rock do you smell what I’m cooking
It doesn’t matter, my abstract rhymes is phatter and tatter tanks
Bank fag pirates and drop them off the plank so they can swim with a Mayko
Snap skeletal from your speak box, in battle tournaments call me Kano
Lyrics unclog your brain like Drano, so keep out of reach of children
Illin from poison liquid spilling from my tooth frame
I am ?suit sang? and praying to a mantis
To increase my fighting skill, depth is beyond Atlantis
My attitude don’t smell nice, you call it rancid
I’m like acid putting ripples in Lake Placid
Then I death both croc’s ??? and sock jocks, they bones pop
And hearts drop out the foot, I’m dirty sut corky cook
So don’t eat the dinner
It’s a voodoo magic contest you get thinner and I’m the winner

[Brook Yung]
Sometimes I look at the clouds and pray to the sky
Thankin the angels for life every day I’m alive
You say that I’m fly? Sort of like an angel disguised
My reply’s "What type of angel am I?" A fine angel
My mind is an angle cradle hangin over my mind
Halo hangs over my eyes you ride but drive safe though
You, takin the L like right angles
A bottomless triangle’s the life that lay over the side
I, see you smilin and lonely inside
You spit rhymes just to see the pandemonium rise
I only decide to rip when I’m controllin the beat
So the whole world know that it’s me... B!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I stay rippin it the second I flow
Get in the zone then I let it be known - you already know
I gotta hit ‘em with consecutive flows
I get it on, then I’m lettin it go - you already know

[Brook Yung]
Boom, clap, I do my dirt like a garden
With mo’ cuts than a rug or a carpet
I bend flows that end most like the farthest
And ring bells like the doors on apartments
Plug, I need a deal or a bargain
Give me a chance or a shot like the bar gives
My flow fresher than a deoderant bar strip
Ladies say HAY like the grass that the barn gets
Okay~! I’m on point like a dart is
The same dart gettin thrown at a target
Another thrown at my bottom, gettin parked in
And I ain’t leavin, I’m gettin my Rosa Parks in

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
I ain’t doing everything that I should
And I ain’t really try as hard as I could
If I could take some things back then I would
But I can’t cause its life

[Nickelus F]
I’m from the good side of the tracks, but took a liking to Gat’s
And I was toting them before I had time to react
Ended up in the jungle with lions, and tigers, and rats
Ended up with a hustle y’all, look at the size of my bags
Ended up with some muscle, think about the size of these mags
Before you come out your mouth, Ill shoot your tongue
Out your mouth, dump the gun
Out and bounce. Keep an eye out for the badge
And slow it down. We riding dirty, dont be driving to fast
Two pounds of the Mary Jane and you bouncing lane to lane
Is you crazed? if you get me locked I’m breaking legs
Matter of fact, pull over right here. Nigga I got it
I don’t know why you trippin’ but you acting out of pocket
Nigga you know the procedure, no speeding while we re-ing
Plus we chiefin’ and I got a couple pills of the eat that
I was planing on giving a little later to this freak and
If we see the police, I won’t get my chance to beat and nigga... (NO!)

[Chorus]

[Nickelus F]
Momma, I’m still thuggin’ the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates and most of ‘em dead wrong
And some of em dead gone, and some had they head blown
Wish I could take it back to you reading me bed poems
But I’m on my own now, I’m taller and grown now
I’m doing all the things that you wish I ain’t know ‘bout
I’ using all the beams, bag and pitching the dro out
Been through everything that my good pen wrote ‘bout
Like dippin’ from the pigs, hitting fences, rip my britches
Kept a skippin, toss the biscuit, It’s a throw away forget it
But I gotta keep my weedies, chances are they will not get me
And I’m gonna wanna smoke when I tell this to my niggas like
We was just chillin when two niggas robbed the building
And got away, but when the cops came they thought we was the villians
So we picked up, picked up, ran so fast they stopped and said forget it
Even though I’m glad I’m kinda mad I went and tossed my pistol but... (No)!

[Chorus]

[Nickelus F]
Yeah, I’m polishing pistols, prepare for battle pass the pump
And I’m popping the pistol and putting people in the trunk
I done peeled of from the po-po with pounds and I’ve been jumped
And I got niggas I know will get down if problems come. Get a gun
It’s already on, It’s already out, It’s already in that nigga mouth
And I will take this nigga work
and flood the streets as if theres a drought and that way
And that way I’ll be the mane and you can’t front like you ain’t know
I’m strutin like a young LL with the Kangol
Thang gone watching niggas flashing all they bank roll
And get that free money like contestants on a game show
We both got guns, but we don’t do it the same though
My partna cop the copper I don’t even need my aim hoe
Roll the window down, stick it out and let the thang go
Hit up everybody, if they don’t get up that thang gone
Aim high, aim low, hit him in his mango
His girl is Chiquita, the heater turn her to a Jane Doe

* send corrections to the typist

Word
Dedicate this to all the ladies from all the guys
Na-mean

Some women out there just love to run with niggaz you know

I want to dedicate this to my old lady ya knahmean
We going to do it

[Verse 1]
That’s why I miss you much
Your laughs lips your touch
All those things we shared
To show each other we cared
Candle light nights out
Lets get it on lights out
Wipe your eyes don’t cry
This love we got it won’t die
I promise this no lie
As long as we both try
To come close and make it work
I know deep down it hurt

[Chorus]-Glenn Lewis
All the tears and the pain
Never again I’ll put you through it
But we can make it
Find it in your heart, in your heart

[Verse 2]
Kiss and make up
I know that will be hard
I love from the start
Now your hearts been scarred
I stand here alone
I feel like the dirt
You lost your main squeeze
Fuck her nice work
The whole town is laughing at me I’m a clown
I Smile on the outside but inside I frown

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I apologize for all I have done
Caught between the walls I can’t run
I sweared I wish I had you near
I sweared I wish I had you here
Yeah you got me in my zone
Come back and make this house a home
If I could take it back I would
Excuse the way I act no good
Never meant to make you cry
Don’t want to hear you say bye-bye
????? For another why
Lets give this love another try

[Chorus}

[Verse 4: Glenn Lewis]
I know I promised babe
If you believe in me
I know at times I let you down
If it were me ask myself could I take it
In my heart as a man might not make it
Honestly sincerely truthfully I come to you
Despite all that I do yeah we can yeah yeah

[Chorus]

I Love you I love you I love you
Believe it when I say baby
Oooooo baby
I’m sorry
I’m sorry whoooo
Whoo I am sorry baby
Sorry Baby ooohh

Scream backwards during this moment of silence
In another dimension gangstas are nonviolent
Science of love, born reality
Physics and Math add up to what we see
But even that ain’t half of the half
My calves are thick, the son of Jah will get there
It’s clear, forever this will stick
Every lyric I share-- strange flows raise up
From the underground more than volcanoes, brains grow
I shine on vines in your mind’s vineyard
It’s splendid, divine vintage
Classic, it is acid, I give descriptions
Like T La Rock, it’s mine; syllables design
I decide to harmonize like nature
I won’t apologize for my mic flavor
All you new jacks got nothing to say
Just Ice was gangsta way before N.W.A.
But I’ll be damned if Sid Vicious didn’t slam
Those next joints will further
Cold gettin’ dumb to put you on point
So why I gotta kick slow... for all y’all bros
That ain’t been in sync with the real flow
The same ones actin’ stiff at the disco
We be like, ‘get your man’, it’s a plan
When C.S.D. hit the floor

It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It ain’t no game

It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang (it ain’t no game)
It’s a love thang

Bent like a nail that failed to get driven
You know, similar (to) Lee Harvey Oswald’s getaway car
It’s bizarre how I are, style’s a mirage
I drop gems and holograms
I call a band to do a show, on the arm man
I stretch this like rubber over my shaft
Up in Africa, the faster thinker
Disaster to the sphincter
Rectum connections rip by my tim tip
Again slip into pink slits like pricks
From pieces of broken glass
Smokin’ grass’ hoppers, gotta step
Stiff as the effect of Aquanet
Aerosal, the error of all, jaws hanging, gaping
I sound freaky like squids mating
I loiter with oysters, they earl pearls over on Monroe
One flow come slow like pornos at half-speed
Pause, video budget small as a mother, call the plumber
Thunder, drop with lightning, I rock tight things
Expand it when I swing slander... my man
You need to leave the ring or retire like Evander
But then again, with all these chumps attemptin’
To be contendin’... they all end up bendin’
Soapboxes I crush, speak on your platform
The black storm settin’ in, thunder and lightning
One of them’s fightin’, one I’m inciting

It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It ain’t no game

It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It ain’t no game

A signature tattoo on you
Not trying to brag, but C.S.D. is my tag crew
Your scribble-scrabble’s ugly-- wack, raps lack
Your character’s secondary like Dudley
I’m on the low like Arnold while you’re getting fondled
I leave chumps at the climax
Similar to ‘(to) be continued’ episodes of Good Times
I hook lines, foes are sowed like climb
What does my now canal bring
Write rhymes on Sunday with the queen’ pumpin’ Al Green
Simply beautiful, my mentals be musical
Think about what’s going on, I’m throwing bombs
Cyborg Cordell Stewart
Elevate, sure the hell can do it
I dwell in the future, welcome to oblivion
The melanin continuum
I have seen and witnessed this present to past
How long will they last’ how long will they last
How long will they last
I asked, and it’s made known to my essence
I stay in the zone, cloaked by depression
Smooth duality
You can’t show and prove’fallacy is fact
My reality’ original black
Vowels come into contact
Of all chakras, forceful shocks
Your hood feels the remorse for blocks
(Fading out / in background as chorus comes in):
Don’t stop, do the wop ‘till you break your arm
Can you relate to what’s going on’ it’s next

It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It’s a love thang
It’s’ a looove thang

It’s a love thang
No, it ain’t no game
It’s a love thang
No, it ain’t no game
It’s a love thang
A love thang
(x2)

Intro:
5 G’s Productions

[Block McCloud Speaking]
Yeah, yo J.J. (What up Block?)
This beat is crazy man it’s cold. (Thank you thank you.)
So cold. Block McCloud (Word) Big Lou what up? 
(And it goes like this.)

[Verse One] [Block McCloud]
I’m so cold I’m cool, it’s like a visit to North Pole
And Block McCloud is the wizard of blizzards
If I don’t know ya I’m frigged 
Storm by ya like a breeze
But my swagger my steez will make a shorty freeze
And drop to her knees like she coppin’ a plea
I’m not iced out or coppin’ no V
I’m just poppin’ with these
Metaphors makin’ sense to all of they charm
As soon as I enter the door, temperature change, droppin’ degrees
Like a Masters, a Bachelors, a Doctorate please
I hear myself I’m so sick with the flow, I’ll probably sneeze (Achu)
I’m so catchy, common cold, you wanna party with me
Well if I got it, you got it, now you caught the disease
Not your a Mark Of The Beast, a monster like Reef
That stomps through the east
And wants to be freed to conquor the streets
Uh, at night I’m heat
I’m hot, I’m cold on the morning block
Changin’ the whole games climate like global warmin’
Hey hey

[Chorus]
This world made me what I am
And I am, just adaptin’ to the weather
So run on home and get your coat cause I’m so cold
You better run and find some shelter
I’m so darn cold hearted
To hot to handle, to cold to hold

[Verse Two] [J.J. Brown]
My prose froze like an icebox, colder than white cops
So Wind in the City where they hostin’ the White Sox
I’m chilly like a chick with silly loot at the night spot
A willy cause I’m Cool Hand Luke but my dice hot
Frosty as the Rockies, y’all just photo copies
Warm until exposed, the way Sodom broke the Nazi’s
Go head and get your posse
I hope you know a polar bear 
Cause you gonna need a coat this storm
I hear it’s pretty cold in there
Jeah
I’m freezin’, it’s top season for frost season
Up oxygen to your car freezin’, ya stop breathin’
(Hey Jay when you gon’ quit?)
Homie not even 
I don’t give a shit, come equipped cause the block’s teethin’
Had low temperatures
Brown bounced the predators
Master beat is red as I drown out competitors
Cold as evidence
Ground beneath the sediments
Sounds that crush clowns like mounds of beefin’ elephants
You geeks will never get, a skotch of my shine
?No Gargamel like you was book?, but the flow shit is mine
Look
Cool your heels fam
Don’t touch the pestilence 
Jay got yourself in the clouds bless the medicines
Like hey

[Chorus]

[J.J. Brown Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen. Me and this dude go way back. Celph Titled!

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
I love this sound proof foam inside my mic booth
It makes me feel like I’m in a padded room
Insane asylum sick with a deranged smile
And I’ll electrocute your recruits 
(What’s this man mean?)
I’m awful with
Ether or arsenic in my canteen 
Rappers can’t compete with me
Fuck it I’m a beast on beats
I get mine
I’m grid iron
You eatin’ cleats for Easter treats
You singin’ summer camp songs
I’m Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Janet Jackson’s Rolling Stones cover, hands on
I’m cold
From production to lyrics
I’ll fuck with the spirits
That unleash catastrophic mayhem fire, that sears kids
Call a bitch to fuck cause I need sex
Like motherfuckin’ Terrell Owen’s needs Kleenex
So respect
The ring leader, let’s ring it off
Jehovah’s Witness with a sawed off and I’ll ring your door
(Hannibal in stereo)
Oh, I’ll watch the exercise video and thought an ab crunch was new cereal
Huh?

[Chorus]

Hop 
Yeah Yeah first string onto open this motherfucker (Hop)

Looking at me big ballin’ 
Hoping out of big body

And ever since a nigga hit it rich 
Bitches hoped on the ban wagon (Damn)

Get guns in case i hop into some gangsta shit 
Nigga, i ain’t scared at all 
That’s way i hoped on hollow points 
Just to tell my chall (hahaha)

Yo, I lay sucker boys hot homes

If you wanna get out of line and violate 
Suckers are fake and hate I annihilate 
The game is dirty 
Thought those boys would mess 
Hoping on on your block 
With those toys and shit 
You see us rollin’ on dubs 
See us rollin’ on scrubs 
I would blowing on boys 
And tearing up ya club 
Oh we don’t give a what? 
See you know what it is 
Suckers shaking and faking 
I gotta handle this bitch 
Money manges with X-Con 
Rollin with X-Con 
Suckers get flexed on 
And gas like X-On 
Real in the field 
All about the dollar bill 
You don’t wanna hop 
But my gap say you will 
Draw down with the still 
Bust shots at your feet 
How you dancing in the street? nigga 
Hop to the beat 
Boy 

Chorus 

(Twig) 
See I’ve done copped the 380 
Now i hoped on the chopper 
Hop on your brain if you come around her trying to short stop me 
Hop on the plane cause i had a couple shortest pain 
Things going to change now I’d done hoped in the game 
How bout my Bens? you know the one with the T.V’s and shit 
A lot of haters hoped around throwing up cause they sick 
Hoping around the same way they be hoped on my dick 
Why you acting like dog? I don’t even want you bitch 
Hop up if you want wanna watch your head get stitch 
And even much worst you found dead in the ditch 
When I’m in the club gotta hop to the bar to get me some lick 
Those hoes hate it when im’ on the hard they know how I get 
My eyes be all red from smoking matrix 
Those highjros got me hoping on those 20 inch sticks 
The Feds, they done got me from all those birds i copped 
But they done lost the evidence 
It be long tell I hop 

Chorus 

(X-Con) 
Don’t stop get it, turn around 
Bounce it up and down hop with it

Everywhere I go I hop out limos 
Nigga, smoking optima 
If I ain’t hopin up n down in your pussy bitch you got to go (Get out) 
I put my feet on the gas 
Cause if I hop out this car I’m going to put my foot in your ass 
Im’ a baller now, no more penny pigeons 
Hoped out of project houses into a mini mansion (Damn) 
I got money, I cant stop and chill 
Hop to dinner said copped the grill (Ding) 
Every other day I got to hopped on some kicks 
And its like everyday I got to hop on me a bitch 
That’s tight and it just don’t stop 
I’m sittin on dubs when I go to the club and hop 

Chorus X3

(Rage)

[Intro: Young Buck]
Young Buck...
He is a depicted as
As a righteous King
Although not without fault 
As well as acclaimed warrior, musician, poet 
Traditionally credited for composing many of the songs

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
An arrow to the heart
It’s time for me to dearly depart
I predicted when the killing would start
Put me in the dark
Sit still like a coupe DeVille in park
Just put some oil in the motor, and he still a ?
Big Dog don’t want to feed his puppies
So they lookin’ in the trashcan hopin’ to get lucky
Ugly, what they sayin’ about the work
Cause there’s nothin’, now the robbers go to church askin’ God throw ‘em something
I propose to the money, let me make it my wife
I spend my whole life tryin’ to fuck a Condoleezza Rice
Life, I try to keep ‘em on, they turn ‘em off
I left (as) a soldier, just to only return as a boss
Rage, got these crackas tryin to put me in a cage
Piecin’ out a brick of [?] to make a nigga hay
I was tryna let ya know a nigga on the stage
I got my mind on getting paid, for my heart full of (Rage)

[Hook: Young Buck]
I wonder what my momma gon’ think about this?
I wonder what my partna’ gon’ think about this?
I wonder if tomorrow, I’m a think about this?

Not a verse in the bible I miss, now look at King David
If I could make a wish, I’d take away the (Rage)

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
But then proceed to load the 12 gauge
Hungry niggas tryna see how much a nigga cell pay
Buncha boosters, so the kids get they clothes cheap
Snitches in the streets got the Feds ridin’ fo’ deep
No sleep, police knockin’ on the door, it’s a battle and a war
Make ‘em pile it the floor
Best friend’ obituary on the dashboard
I see his face in the glass as I fast-forward
[?] my kids like, so I ask, Lord
Please stop me from makin’ these people empty out this cash drawer
I’m thinkin [?], you thinkin’ that car, I’m thinkin ?
You thinkin’ that star, respect will take you far
The rage will make a broke nigga ? it off
If you been settin’, I don’t gotta set it off
I left (as) a soldier, just to only return as a boss
Now they askin what it cost, but my heart full of (Rage)

[Hook: Young Buck]
I wonder what my momma gon’ think about this?
I wonder what my partna’ gon’ think about this?
I wonder if tomorrow, I’m a think about this?

Not a verse in the bible I miss, now look at King David
if I could make a wish, I’d take away the (Rage)

(The boy David is bringing food to his brothers who are with ?
He hears the fisting ? jackal laugh challenging. 
Send our own champion to decide the outcome in single combat. 
David says he’s prepared to face Goliath.)

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Back in the rap game to start a riot
Radio didn’t want to try, but I didn’t buy it
Been workin’ all these years just to get fired
Convicted felon, so it’s hard for me to get hired
Boarder patrol been checkin’ in the big tires
Makin it hard for Americans, so we turn to violence
Ask you, if you’re scared to die, and all I hear is silence
But when you on the block, (you) portray to be the wildest
Since the jail [?] and they say I’m childish
Cause I don’t see no other way to go around this
Just walkin’ through the projects and a nigga found this
First time I ever learned what a whole pound is
Young nigga, barely I was even ‘round kids
Left me with an old soul, that’s what my sound is
Still a soldier, but I gotta show ‘em who the boss
They say the reason that ya lost cause ya heart full of (Rage)

[Hook: Young Buck]
I wonder what my momma gon’ think about this?
I wonder what my partna’ gon’ think about this?
I wonder if tomorrow, I’m a think about this?

Not a verse in the bible I miss, now look at King David
if I could make a wish, I’d take away the (Rage)

(You know Goliath falls, and David kills him with his own sword, and beheads him,
the Philistines flee in terror. ? to know the name of the young champion. 
And David tells them, I am the son of Jesus.)

"You don’t know nothing do you?
That’s the beauty of gold
It never tarnishes 
Lasts forever, too 
You can melt it down, pound it, twist it, piss on it
But it’s always the same gold
It was here long before we were and it’ll be here a long time after we’re gone
I bet you a lot of men have died for the gold that’s just in this one piece"

[Verse 1]
If you cry under fire then you wasn’t built for war
If a pimp take you girl then your girl was never yours
Mental kickboxer, still test jaws
I’m Grandmaster, Grimm Reaper
Feds snooping at door like Mr. Roper
Monitored cause talented like Mr. Ripley
State frustrated, hated, can’t get me
The Gingerbread Man but for short call me Gingy
Suicidal, jump right in a glass of milk
I’m made of dough so watch a nigga swell
I could never fall apart cause mad is the flow
You could never ever take my crown, I’ll kill you at a show
Hit stars with guns, make ‘em see stars
Hit cops with dum-dums, trying to be smart
Gotta lay him down, didn’t know he was a narc
Gingerbread man but I have a stone heart
Payback extortion from fraternal order 
Informant sent letter to D.A. with tracing paper
With invisible ink, trapped in magic library
I wanna scream but it’s a secret indictment
Judge whistle Dixie from excitement
The law is a lefty, so where the rights went?
Pain on display for world like David Blaine
True crime stories but they think I entertain

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

[Verse 2]
Are you down with so and so?
What’s your gimmick?
Nothing, my life is lyrics so I spit it
When murder is something that you become accustomed to
Taking a life just don’t fuck with you
House niggas faceless, buried in field of potters
Field niggas found shelter, now squatters
If eyes are the window to soul, then why am I squinting?
My face is on the money that I’m printing, strike a pose
Wanna take life, strike my foes
I rolled through Hell and it froze
My halo got burnt but it still glows
I’m not on my feet but I stay on my toes
If we ain’t cool then that’s the way it goes
Forget all the kid shit fucking with a grown man
Niggas running around fantasizing like they’re Peter Pan
Your life’s a scam and I’ma fuck it up like Neverland

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

All that other shit is overrated
I want the money
Cash

[Sample from "Trespass"]
"I don’t know what this stuff is anymore
God’s gold, our gold, fool’s gold
What we can do is take as many of them as we can and hope for the best"
"What about trading the gold to ‘em for our safety?"
"They’d kill us anyway
I would if I was them
Truth is Vince I don’t see any way we’re gonna get out of here quiet"

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream, cream cream

[Static/Major - Intro]

NAWW! I’m ridin with the top off
a/k/a Boss Hog, watch me brush them haters off

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
First I valet the car, check into my five-star..

Ah, I chase it with a lobster tail
I insist I got the bill, I got the bi-yahye-yahye-ill

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We gon’ play it like we at the fiesta
I go in hard at the grand Casin-a
Flippin chips to all my mamamitas
..let me see you shake your kiesta

[Lil’ Wayne]
Check it, shawty do what I want
Who I want, how I want
The way I want, when I want
Even when I don’t and now I do
So gimme you, all I want
for you to do, and all I want
for you to do, all I want for you to do is me, heh!
So dig that, find a shovel dig that
I say I’ll just take the hit and you can take the weed back
You can make ‘em in fact, if you keep me intact, and
I’ll just play the friend, I got dem goons in the back

[Chorus]

HEY!

[Intro: Dubbed voice]
Digital master

[Method Man]
Uh Oh like Lumidee, if Meth ain’t that shit by now, I’m soon to be
When I choke hold mics, I don’t give em room to breathe
I’m just doin me, but bitch if you fine, I’ll do you free
By now if you don’t know who it be, don’t make me tell
Just know I Killa Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
Man my game ugly as that nigga Sam ???
I’m so funky, I can’t even stand the smell
Come on, life’s a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don’t get comfy, I cramo your style like a monkey
Even +Deemi+ needs +Moore+ than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My four five barks
Just one shot is enough to clear the block like it’s time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
With guns that put a shot in your ass like free clinics

[Chorus 2X: Method Man & J. Wells]
Everytime we drop the top it don’t stop
Everytime we pop the glock it don’t stop
Everytime we rock the block it don’t stop
As long as the product good, they gon cop

[J-Ro]
It’s the bar barbarian, big butt carrying
Hittin urban areas from ??? to Maryland
My Lincolm Navigate, my name on the plate
My name is J-Ro, biatch, get that shit straight
No time for those who hate, I’m too busy putting dinner on the plate
And rocking old Chevys with the candy paint and gold flake
Hail to the land of earthquakes and real niggas and fakes
The ‘Ro rocking with the Method, you might as well accept it
My flow is so killer it’ll probably get arrested
I’m bumpin Bob Marley, sippin hobbs and barley
I’m old and dangerous like poisen calamari
Don’t fuck with Likwit, but you didn’t believe
Now your ass in hot water just like a teaf leaf
Everytime we drop the top, here comes the cops
Everytime we rock your pop, the bottles pop

[Chorus 2X f/ KB I Mean ad-libs]

[KB I Mean]
I run through tracks like Maurice Green
KB I Mean, more to life than the air you breathe
Cheese, get a piece, I been part of the streets
Sweet liquid, my niggas will chip part of your teeth
Big beats like bloa, wow
They call your boy the golden child, I flow for miles
Classic, better check my foul
I’m not the one, been on the run, blow my lungs animal style
I’m a wild son of a gun, sign of the times
I’m the king, so the prince my son
That’s one, get punched like clocks and chumps
Pop the trunk, watch me stunt, you flinch, get jumped
I’m sick everyday of the month
No cure for sure, I’m the nigga they want
Spit raw, so everytime you bite my style
Just remember that it was J-Ro, KB & Meth Tical, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: J. Wells]
Shouts out to EP, Big Bonzi J. Wells, Liquid Entertainment, for all you haters
Please turn your radios up as loud as they go

Fuck 8-Ball, Super Saco and Gin
Ese pass the Corona to this crazy Mexican
Pop one open and take the motherfucker down
Catch a buzz, and what the homies will clown
Fuck St. Ives and the other punk shit
Grab a Corona and you won’t want to quit
Take it to the head and catch a hell of a high
And don’t stop drinking it till the bottom goes dry
I’m down with the Raza cuz I have good taste
I don’t fuck with cheap beer cuz all that shit is a waste
Nothing but Corona, and it’s all I drink
And the other punk shit I pour straight down the sink
The only beer I fuck with is made in Mexico
Kickin up this jam to let you motherfuckers know
I don’t drink Brass Monkey or the Colt 45
Only the Corona keep me feeling real live
So if you don’t know now, you better catch up quick
A cold ass Corona to the head, it’s a lid
Before you rush that Coors or the punk Bud Dry
Pop open a Corona and you know the reason why
They say friends don’t let friends drive away drunk
Bullshit motherfucker, don’t drink if you’re a punk

*scratches repeat until fade*
..cruisin through the Eastside..
..eightball..
..cruisin through the Eastside..
..pass the cerveza..

shorter than the mothafucka fallin’ to his knees
but I still talk shit, stalk g’s bitch!

Uhh! Check it out, yo; it’s called, uh, well, uh
"K Sera Sera," whatever will be will be
And the track is kinda in there, so lemme bust a li’l
A li’l rhyme...

Check it out on the one, two, three...

Standin’ 5’11", and I’m almost 6 feet
18 years old, rock a new beat
Got no nickname, stay the cool sane
Kick the same rhymes, play the same games
To watch my back, but ain’t no vics here
Bring in the new--that tune was last year
In strode the baby brother, comin’ from the mind school
Flow from blue Bic, and paper’s wide-ruled
If I had a penny for every note that I played
Or if I had a dollar for every bar I create
I guess that I would reckon, "By golly, I’m gettin’ paid"
Or better yet, "I reckon it’s time to be gettin’ paid!"
So I sit and think, "Well, should I pull my Plan 9?"
I’ll leave it up to the powers and the stars
Since I’m from the cosmos of another planet, see
I believe my karma will guide me to my destiny
So I flow, not on the rhymes
But related to my shade of mind, or, rather, vibes
Que sera sera, what will be will be
Whatever’s kinda clever, what the future holds for me
I guess it’s just a thought, though my mind is kinda hazy
My name is Justin, baby

I got my skullcap on, then the flow from my mind starts
As I rip for days from the land of the mic arts
Cream of the crop, a cool, blue beatnik
Blessed with the gift, and now it’s time to kick the ill shit
Love to eat the scallops, and quit with the doo-doo raps
Stay away from ill crack, listen to the Fatback
Smooth on a rough track, time to catch a catnap
If you are my brother, I’ll be sure to give you much dap
Ya bound to get your head smacked, if you try to illjack
Get your kit from Acme, set yourself an ill trap
I used to talk of vickin’, would step and finger-lickin’
But now my mic endeavors have improved over time
Oh yeah, I’m still the same brother who has got to pickin’
So listen to the moody groove, piano, and the vibes

Ahh, and ya don’t stop. Yeah, ya know, yeah
And we the sure shit, guaranteed to be the ultimate
Ya got to keep it on to the break-of-dawn
To the rhythm, y’all, ya don’t stop
And ya don’t quit, ya don’t stop
Ya gotta keep on, keep the flow on
And, baby, ya know you and the rhythm is always on
And I’m out...

Oh yes fuckin Stilo en espanol
This time were gonna do all this in espanol
Check it out here we go

[Verse 1]
Ano ‘99 y aqui esta el esquadron
Con el musico que esta causando sensacion
En toda la nacion la raza esta chingando
La mada esta jodiendo cundo el uni esta rapiando
Sin duda esta es la rola mas cabrona del momento
A’mas yo no te miento Latino cien porciento
Y nunca me arepiento porque soy un vato firme
Concretos el supuesto cabron y sin pretecstos
El Hombre Mas mafioso y mas temido de la industria
Te doy doy en la madre si esta mierda no te gusta
Porque yo no juego homes yo no soy jugete y te meto siete
So trucha con el coete

[Chorus 4 Times]
Y si no te gusta
Puto you te chingo

[Verse 2]
Yo soy el mas cabron y el mas astuto
Tengo a tus amigos y familia vestida de luto
Te pido que no chinges conmigo yo te digo
Pero la cagastes porque ya eres mi enemigo
Quien se pone al brinco mejor que se siente
Porque el cementerio esta lleno de valientes
Este es un poema pa’los que tiene problemas
Que no tengan pena que dilaten sus dilemas
Te quema la bala cuando entra sin embargo
Me valen madre todos estos bastardos
Yo estoy en control en mi cancion el mas chingon
Y de cualquier situacion siempre soy el mas cabron

[Chorus 4 Times]

[Verse 3]
Me toca mover si el esquadron esta presente
Asi que no te asustes si resbalas derepente
Y esque simplemente somos unos bandoleros
Y cuando no ay mecha siempre esta el filero
Porque el barrio es primero no importa cual el barrio
Cuando ay desmadre ay que hacerlo necesario
Para defender ay que sorprender al enemigo
Darle buen castigo sin dejar tanto testigo
Y cuando tiras gomos por la mira pon al puto en la mira
Pero abusado con la jura y con la tira

[Chorus 4 Times]

[Jehovah’s Boy - Intro]
Yeah, WHOO! (hahaha)
Rizin Sons (yep)
God I thank You for another one (Yes, sir!)
You know You a beast, right?
Look, God can use you in any way shape or form
if you just let Him come in, man
That’s right! But you cain’t be in self; you gotta know this too, listen...
Look...

It’s not about you, it’s about what
the Father, the Spirit, and the Son do
Trinity - the only triangle office I run thru
Game on the line and I know who to go to
and game is life, give it to Christ!
We need to think twice about decisions that we come to
When you club and party or let the Lord use you (c’mon!)
And youth, we need to get our lifestyles up
Don’t worry about go picking them Lifestyles up, feel me?
Think about it as a turnpaper
You gotta have communication, structure, foundation
You want God to speak? Then His voice is the period
Don’t run on with yo sentence ‘cause then you won’t hear Him [You ain’t gon’ hear Him!]
Listen, God’ll be your exclamation point, make your statement stronger
‘cause you don’t want the devil’s comma (nope!)
No more drama, He’ll give you the words to say
When they ask you for your sources, you tell ‘em "Yahweh" and..

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Now it doesn’t mater the time, temperature, or the place
As long as you believe and step out on faith
With God, no discrimination - doesn’t matter you black, white
Dominican Republican or Haitian
God’ll use you in any way, no matter your destination
Even when this altercations are hatin (WOO!)
He’s the reason we have a source of communication
Gave His son to die wit no hesitation!
And Jesus came, turned water to wine
Just one TOUCH from His hand, everything is fine (I thank You, Lord)
Use David in the fight people thought wouldn’t last
So with God on your side, there’s nothing you can’t surpass
HE’S - pure and holy, tried and true
In Chapter 14:26 of Matthew [What’d it say?]
TWO fish, FIVE loaves, fed a multitude
If He can do it for them, then He can do it for you

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Truth be told, workin for God is not simple
But think about the pain and the bloodshed that He went through [Thank You, God]
to save each of us in this world we call sinful
So we need to be strong and hold up GOD’S temple
Like Tim Duncan - keep it strictly fundamental
Stay in your Word and encourage the people with your mentals (yep!)
‘Cause souls can be saved just by hearin what you been through!
God givin you life is not meant to be accidental
Things that go on in the world, very incidental (yeah)
Temptation hits, harder than punches right to the temple
Your soul gives way just like cavities do to dental
That’s why we need Christ just like lead needs a pencil
We are peculiar people that can be difficult
Decisions that need to be made never simple
We were spiritually elected, like the presidential (c’mon!)
So while you’re here on earth, think of where you tryna make it to

[Chorus 2X]
Just roll wit Him, worship Him and stroll wit Him
Whether you in jeans, Forces, or Dirty Denim
Give up the life of sinnin and live the life of winnin
in everything you do, Let The Lord Use You

Holla! (WOO!)
Yeah, hahahaha!
Here we go! We got a nice one here, haha!
Rizin Sons, let’s GO! (C’mon!)
Just let Him use you man (C’mon!)
Just let the Lord use you, yep!

[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Heaven Razah, wings up
All my T.H.U.G. Angelz riding
You know how the halo go
Bob Marley like this one, yo

[Hell Razah]
I stay surrounded with a Godly council, amount to
A hundred and forty four thousand children to count to
We turn our projects to pentagons, it’s war around you
We come from, black jewels to dirty scoundrels of the state
I know the most high supply, every natural cause
To the actual, physical, the spiritual loss
When he knock us up, for you the one to open the doors
I seen my people steady falling, like it ain’t no floors
Bottomless pits, for hell convicts
A conscience, black awareness of the kings and prophets of the lord
Clean your soul from the wickedness before you, boy
Eternal life is my only reward

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...
Blessed be the meek in us...

[Junior Reid]
Stallion, boy
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire

[Timbo King]
My bloodline, trace it back to the great prophets
Strapped up, with the mac and the full cartridge
The media got the young brains hostage
Handcuff to the projects with no logic
Electrolytes, I don’t need no sockets
My flow wattage, spit out sky rockets
I live opposite, center of apocalypse
Connect the stars, astrologist
I out your powerless, walking down mountain slow
Lost souls wandering in the valleys below
Craftsmen built the temple, we develop to grow
There’s no oath, we kin from the root to the oak

[Junior Reid]
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Give me what my heart desire
Getting smoke from a burning fire
Getting smoke from a burning fire

[Skinny Pimp]
Get that money mane if you true to the game
Brothers coming up mane street thugs never change
Straight out the projects now we cashing fat checks
Pimp came a long way from slangin out the duplex
Now I’m on BET with A.J. and Free

Still hard never flauge all in NYC like the mob
When I do my job pulling up in them fancy cars
This is for my gangstas ballin in them Cadillac trucks
Moving weight state to state telling me come the sets full
Now we in the bigger biz still taking care of the kids
Still taking care of the fam still hitting big licks
Anybody cross us y’all gotta die
Understand this we ain’t letting nothing slide
We Mafia so never forget and respect that
This is the business this is Tha Classic

[Chorus 2X: 211]
Why don’t you come to my ghetto hood watch me come up
On the video scene riding clean we blowed up
The Kings of the south got it all sewed up
Tha Classic this is the classic

[Skinny Pimp]
Hard times hard years and hard peers I done been thru it
This time no sad faces cuz we gotta do it
Get rich or die trying this is for my ghetto moms
Mothers in the ghetto this is coming from your son
The dope game show me the rap game owe me
Now everybody in the world finna feel me
The IC triple P International Cross country
Professional Paid Pimp bringing it back to the streets
Never will I sell my sold for a pot of gold
I will kill these folks before I let them do me cold
I’m the chosen one and I keep God first in my life
Even when I’m strapped up riding in the silent night
I keep it true like my kinfolk Lucky Lou
If he don’t get you Big Hill gonna get you
So when it’s time to ride we gon keep it real quiet
And when you gotta die you can’t blame my guys

[Chorus]

[Skinny Pimp]
Why don’t you take a trip to Memphis that’s where all the pimps at
Maury suits and Gator boots fine women and our strips
We full of pure passion leaders or fashion
Pimping and macking big bank we stacking
24 inch big wheelers car dealers drug dealers
Big gun shooters and we grid up like P-Miller
We got the money and power
the good and the Johnson to Johnson we self-rising like flour

[211]
Why don’t you come to my ghetto hood watch me come up
On the video scene riding clean we blowed up
The kings of the south got it all sewed up
Plenty of pimping in the big body of grown rode up
The flicker of the diamonds all around the wrist is shining
Pure pure rubian flex sipping wine and
Bag them loot bundles of cash in the plastic
This is the classic COME!

[Chorus]

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus]
When I come through in the drop, why they lookin’ surprised?
There they go again, them haters
And I can tell that they hatin’ from the look in their eyes
There they go again, them haters
And I can tell from the stares when they look at my team
There they go again, them haters
They admirin’ the jewels and they notice the gleam
There they go again, them haters

[Verse 1]
(Hater proof) 
I’m sittin’ here tryin’ to figure out, is it your job to ride dick?
Or you just don’t like me and wanna hate on Rah shit
Or you really don’t know what you doin’ 
But you just doin’ what you usually be doin’
You a hater, it comes naturally
I’m on some Mary Blige shit, no hater way
Yo hater way, get your ass kicked like a 8 away
(I’m dead serious)
In Hollywood with Queen Lah, can’t hate on my shit
23s on the Caddy, can’t hate on my whip, c’mon

[Verse 2]
Is it because I don’t need music to get money, y’all hate me?
Or you mad cuz I been eatin’ since y’all was babies?
I’ma grown ass woman, quit playin’, haters all in my biz
Prayin’ that Dana won’t do it again
What you mad cuz I been holdin’ it down with Shakim?
And you switch managers every year but still they not him
We got TV on lock down, whole Unit hot now
Billboard Number 1, I’m claimin’ my spot now

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yo they see the way I move in the drop
I cruise through the stop sign, movin’ through ya block
My shoes and my watch, I’m Gucci to the socks
Y’all niggas hate me
I’m cool and I’m hot, chain feel like AC
Basically none can wit’ P, you stuck in three
I’m fifth gear, locked man wrist wear
Shit yeah, demolishin’ the game
But don’t worry, I plan to retire in six years

[Verse 4]
Another day, time pass baby, y’all still hatin’, it’s all good
It’s my turn, I’m takin’, but cousin, it’s still hood
Money ain’t change shit except the jewels and the whips
The zeroes at the end of my deposit slips
I’m still street, it’s in me, don’t force it outta me
Cuz when I street sweep the heat swing rapidly
Life’s so- I just learned when no one gimme shit
I struggle to burn to earn this life

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Playa bench, listen
Haters with no money, they see me, it’s so funny
I start fillin’ six, start throwin’ up money
Ballin’, yo I’m addicted, I just can’t stop
When the cops yell "Freeze" I show ‘em the watch
Then I hop out the drop and there ain’t no beef
Ice grillin’ all the time, I got platinum teef
Now everybody hollerin’ "Louis 13th"
And I don’t mean to toot my own horn but beep beep

[Verse 6]
They ‘magine the donuts and I get crazier cash
Leave ‘em sleepin’ wit’ the fishes like Hanks and the splash
Hate the size of the watch and the way that it flash
Hey buddy, look out front, that’s a Jag for you ass
I’m talkin’ the whole nine, wood grain in the dash
And honest, you can get the whole nine, talk trash
Rappers get ate fast, and when I say "ate fast"
I mean pullin’ the pistol and givin’ ‘em 8 fast

[Chorus]

100% hater proof
100% hater proof
100% hater proof

Intro:

(singing) Nobody knows, nobody knows how, how hard

[Verse One]
They was wonderin when
a female artist that could spark and take two to the chin
ten thousand and one it wasn’t no flick and I do it again
you written flow to spit
no matter if it flows worth pantyhoes you gettin stripped
how low I fit
Stay humble, lookin in my eyes
don’t need no yes men round me, I downsize
drama it don’t stop, yellin don’t pass go
and if they read another reason then I’m cuttin they throats
gettin the doe, all out yellin lets ride
my baby say lets do it big, I’m sayin lets do it live
Bling Bling, so we comin through on gleam gleam
bitches on my bra, strap niggas on my g-string
4ft 11 full of fire, my desire, my empire
I make drives, my lyrics, now I’m out peace for hire
feel it, the sky was the limit, this ain’t for you if you timid
I’ma spit it infinite, now take a spot
it’ll take another two thou to get in it, wit a

Chorus: Silk-E (repeat 2X)

mean mug on my face,
I’m in it to win it,
I’m all out for my spinach, I gots to get it,
they just don’t wanna see me feedin my belly,
they wanna see me walkin on my ass with no (money?)

[Verse Two]
Really don’t even need this
everybody tryin to get a piece of my pie, ain’t no secret
so I, wade in the water and I quietly except
catch Flack like Roberta, black girl smasha, it’s murda
sayin mo murda, I say lets everybody get further
confine me till, to the box and I’ma still get heard of
Stayin assertive, if hoes in a choke hold is how I gotta go
het em wit a right low, so they can read hobo
regiment is what I represent, step into the scene
gettin cream, got you on me like I’m docked on masculine
SILK fiend, make it where you addicted to me
leave haters judgin in repression that they gettin to me
damit, granit I know ou got to lay on your bed
but I’m tryin to have somebody else make it once I’m seein the bread
make decisions leavin stake and eggs
get my family paid, so I gotta give my money to everybody else
have you ever had somebody that was all in yo face... hawkin
actin like they the best thing walkin
got a lot on my mind, they squeezin my world, I work best under pressure
just pray I don’t crack and keep it together, wit a

Chorus

[Verse Three]
Sexy, intelligent, dealin with the positive,
if it’s negative then it’s irrelevant
so pushin a pelican makin it prelevant for em, nah I ain’t sellin it
adrendaline driven by vivid visions, and I’m rippin
I’m stickin like hittin em wit tip dawgs in prison
sure I rep, you should just pack up your bags and kick rocks
retreat to your rest, saving your weak collected thoughts
mind blowin, pain in your brain blowin ya mind
bringin it back, overpowered pack with each line
my hustle in a hallux in the gem and kill your ambition
it’s a tradition to give a tribute once I get through spittin
higher learnin, you can stand on the top of Mt. Vernon
while I grab garbage, back the game and gut it out ya kids learnings
wit a...

Chorus (Repeat 4X)

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Dom Pachino, Golden Child

[Chorus: Golden Child in Spanish]

[Dom Pachino]
I know she like thugs, I can see it in her eyes
She came with that clown, but she wanna change sides
Could it be my jewels, or my luxury ride
It might be beard, cuz I dress kinda fly
I got a girl, but I want a slice of the pie
Temptation’s a bitch, and I know she wanna try
Damn, mami, you got a mean set of thighs
And a set of lips, that’ll suck a man dry
I’mm slip you my number, just make sure you call
If my girl picks up, you my cousin, that’s all
I got a nice condo, right next to the mall
And I’m sitting sideways like my name was Paul Wall
One night with me and that clown won’t exist
You ain’t living life, if you don’t take a risk
Dame besos, girl, give me a kiss
It’s whatever you want, I’ll grant you a wish

[Chorus]

[Hook: Golden Child in Spanish]

[Dom Pachino]
Girl, slide with me, baby girl, take a ride with me
One night is like eternity
Your man’s not a concern to me
For certainly, he don’t no problem with P
I got big plans for you and me
Like blue skies and white sands in the West Indies
Look in my eyes girl, can’t you see
The chemisty is hot, like a hundred degrees

[Chorus]

Bom bom bom bom...

Life is a test
And you’re done

Testin’ me
My God is stressin’ me
My destiny
That perhaps so hard to see

In the morning when I rise
Every days on new surprises
Or blessin’ in the skies
And even though this world grow cold
As you always hold
A place in my heart
For me you gave me my star

Can this be
This world is history 
Why must we be
So bloody crazy
God help me see
Is testin’ me
This world is stressin’ me

Yeah

C’mon

Testin’ me (testin’ me)
My God is stressin’ me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

It’s testin’ me
It’s testin’ me
Why is it stressin’ me
Yeah
And so it seems
Is fallin’ apart at the seems
And all of my dreams will never ever be seen

Yeah

As I wipe the tears from my eyes
You ask me why do I cry
As the days go back more and more that

It’s so heavy
No no 
It’s so heavy
It’s testin me

Testin’ me (testin me)
My god is stressin’ me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

Bom bom bom bom...

[Verse 1]
Still there when road darkens, kill with spears when the foes 
Marching feeling fear, from your whole squadron          \t
No pardons, real severe and I’m cold 
Hearted, ninja’s clearly the most monstrous\t         \t
Throats are slit in the coliseum
Pose harsh risk and demolish heathens\t\t\t
Boxers bleeding, got the stoppage I’m bobbing
And weaving, props and homage or theres carnage and grieving\t\t
It’s sorrow for weaklings there’s pain and anguish
I’m macho when seiging your reign is anquished\t\t\t
The blade is brandished, enraged when you take
Advantage you’re slained by the danger’s damage\t\t\t
Remain a savage, my wrath is blind
Maim then vanish in callous times\t\t\t
I’m keen, hid and wear the veil
I dream big, and dare to fail\t\t\t

[Verse 2]
I’m where bravado and terror’s from, tommorrow may never come 
I war chant and follow the nearest drum\t\t
You perish from the fists, when it pounds yall
The jealous ones will wish for my downfall\t\t
Keep at the helm and steer my own ship
Creep in the realm prepared, I won’t slip\t\t\t
Woeful attack, lone will lash out
Go to the mat, foes will tap out\t\t\t
Hang on after others let go
Stand strong have the hunger tenfold\t\t\t
Plunder and roam, scourge the traitors
The hunter is cold, a terminator\t\t\t\t
Foes is threatened, spies are shuddering
The soul is strengthened with trials and suffering\t\t
You don’t know, I think you should watch then
Where hope grows, miracles blossom

That’s when it all changed
See that’s was the first time we wanted to get on stage
I was nervous, my brother wasn’t afraid
We both was at a very young age
Mom & dad worked hard for that 5 dollars an hour minimum wage
They treated our folks like they were slaves
But they did whatever they had to to keep food on the plate
So we made a promise that some how some way
We gon make it up out of this ghetto one day
Maybe cause we were locals
Prolly why promoters felt like we didn’t deserve to get paid
We were loved by some hated by many
Years pass growing up now, we just met Benny
Fan base started growing still wasn’t making a penny
That’s not even half a mile in my shoes
We became the biggest thing while we were still only in high school
But we ain’t settled so right after we graduated we moved

All we’ve ever wanted to do is get to a better tomorrow
So much in our hearts to prove to get to a better tomorrow

So now we in the M.I.A
Shout out to my cousin Oshannah for giving us a place to stay
The homie Verse stayed right around the corner with his moms
My uncle Trent stayed 20 minutes away so me, my brother and Verse
Was running through the streets of Miami grindin’ seeing as tho we couldn’t get work
Then a radio battle rap show with big lip
And super Cindy was the only way that we got heard
See we skipped college ain’t with that blue collar
Was only chasing our dream ain’t never chased dollars
And we was on fire when we left St. Thomas
Went to Miami thinking we was gon get more hotter
But that didn’t happen at all we knew that we needed to leave
And it was between Atlanta and New York
Then our tickets got bought to come to the A to rock a show
If that wasn’t a sign I don’t know what it was
So they payed us 350 to perform a club
So we packed up our bags like here we come
And were fresh out of high school still very young
But this was our dream, to some we were done

All we’ve ever wanted to do is get to a better tomorrow
So much in our hearts to prove to get to a better tomorrow

So we went to Atlanta and decided we wasn’t gon leave
With 20 dollars in the pocket of some old jeans
Came across a few salesmen that sold dreams
But we wasn’t gon quit uh uh by no means
We started meeting with labels and we were laughed at
Like you from an island tryna rap go home please
Started doing talent shows to win money
Just to keep the lights on and bring home a lil groceries
Buzz started growing
Atlanta started showing mad love so we just kept on going
Deals on the table now Akon blowing up
And hearing bout us from everybody who know him
Did the deal with Konvict then "Losin’ It" dropped
Still here standing even after "Losin’ It" flopped
They wanted us to sing no rappin’ straight pop
And that’s just some of the reason why that album ain’t dropped
And I ain’t tryna get props all I want is my shot
Our chance to blow and probably make it to the top
And at least I can say that we tried if we failed
Plus the fans ain’t never cared bout first week sales

All we’ve ever wanted to do is get to a better tomorrow
So much in our hearts to prove to get to a better tomorrow

So much in our hearts to prove to get to a better tomorrow

1st Verse:
Lolita got her hair pulled 
Indian in her family, that look to fancy up in my hood 
Said NaNa and them 
Back Packing on an adventure like Fin 
Around those where you biz 
With itchy arms, tattooed in syringe  
Alcohol anonymous
Crack Heads looking prominent
Street light glow, little homies know what time it is
Unless you bouncing bullets Superman burnt metropolis
Trying to safe look ware binoculars
This shit will shock you like baraka does 

Hook:

2nd Verse:
Who that Glock hanging out the window 
Pop against the wind blow 
Death birthed a widow 
Stress rolled in Indo 
Protect home and kinfolk 
I’ll polish that chin bone for violating that get some 
What you know about 
Living in the system 
I’m living proof bleeding threw yo’ system 
I been threw it all 
And then some

Snatchy chain rocking let his head spun 
Us D-Boyz got her head sprung

[Legacy]
Jerrrrrk! I’m so cocky with it
Got my iced out clothes like Rocky hit it
Got your girl on my swag she lovin them jerkin songs
Like the new iPod just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin and the waist I’m beatin
Done I got on my way I’m leavin
She like where you goin? I ain’t got my shoes and purse
I said it’s none of your concern, and she yelled "You’re a jerk!"
So I walked out the door, called Ben J.
Told him it’s a function he said I’m on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e’rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f’real jerk, you lookin for this stuff
And the whole party heard her but all I could hear was

[Chorus: Legacy]
Wah, wah, wah wah wah "You’re a jerk!"
Why you trippin? I ain’t even do nuttin "You’re a jerk!"
"You’re a jerk!" I’m a jerk? You ain’t never lie
But ay, do me a favor, call me jerk one more time
"You’re a jerk!" (I know) "You’re a jerk!" (I know)
"You’re a jerk!" (I know) "You’re a jerk!" (Ay, ay)
"You’re a jerk!" (I know) "You’re a jerk!" (I know)
"You’re a jerk!" (I know) "You’re a jerk!" (Ay, ay)
"You’re a jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)
"Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk" (Jerky)

[Ben J.]
Ha ha!! .. Everything quiet and the bass real hard
And I stay geeked up never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y’all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I’m a beast, I’m a kang, and I guess I’m a jerk
And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt
Man you call me a bother wit’cha lil’ jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I’m squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil’ stuff
while she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough
So I did it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like where you goin? There’s another girl naked
She screamed out loud Ben J. "You’re a jerk!"
And I had nothin to say but sorry that it hurts

[Chorus]

[over latter fourth of Chorus]
Hey Brody! (Yeah whattup bro?)

"Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!" (Jerked up, jerked up)

(12 o’klok)
All I saw was the flames from the calico
I want to bust the skull in his head but fuck it I had to go
So many years up in the game, I thought this bitch was real
Look in his eyes, saw through the lies, that’s when his shit was peeled
Fucked up the deal, I had to off him send him out of space
Said a prayer over the puddle of blood that used to be his face
Who was to care, watch that nigga die till he could die no mo
Fuck me up inside, the feelings wouldn’t let me cry for show
I heard the twisted sounds of sirens on my fucking block
I guess its time I get this double barrel pumped and cocked
Know niggas must drop 
Let off a shot, I heard a tire screech
I tried to bail, so close to hell I felt the fire reaching
Running through the doorway, found some niggas to hide me through the daylight 
Hated to put them up in my business, fuck it, it might mean they life 
Them niggas ask me why I offed him so I had to tell him
That nigga wanted to play some fuck shit but I wanted to help him
I gave him close to thirty gee’s told him bring his patna, get yo ass to texas
Two birds gon be up in a bravada, make sure you inspect them
Come back, I’ma give your fourty percent just to help yo ass out
But if you smell some fuck shit, then nigga you mash
All the while that nigga thought he was fucking me
Expecting sixty four oz’s, he gots a quarter key
Wonder where my shit be, he tell me back in Houston
I’m looking for some answers, all he gave me was excuses
First it was a carjack, then it was the coppers so he had the ditch it
Then it was the bitches, plenty stories but they all twisted
Fuck it anger made me react before I knew it
His fucking head was on them tracks black dripping fluid

(Chorus: 12 o’klok)
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
Fuck it, I’m in this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
I come to bring the pain in this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How can I refrain from this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How I maintain

(12 o’klok)
A couple of days later, I’m wanted, they saw me from the building
Ain’t going to prison even if means somebody children
Let me catch the bitch that said my name, I got some drama for him 
And just my luck, that nigga fuck us all the time was knowing
Gave up some presidents to get his residence and catch him
Word out the p, they got his back and they gon try to protect him
I gots to catch him cause the cell is hell and in the cell ain’t no living wealthy
All you got is memories to tell, that shit that ain’t healthy 
In the middle of the night I creep
Catch him in his sleep, I’m through his window
Bout to bring some solitude through his temple, peep
Saw that nigga twisting turning in darkness he got me crazy
I remember the day I lost it, I heard his baby
Hiding from the next room, somebody move, it was his bitch
Looking me straight up in my shit, eyes wide
Told her shake the nigga, wake the nigga, seconds later he face the trigga
Fuck the fasad, its time to paint a picture
Bitch was on the side wining and weeping, too later to cry
Might as well get used to some permanent sleep cause you waiting to die 
Door slung open it was a little kid, a little shot he hit the floor 
Before I could realize the fuckers dead, I was busting a couple of times more
Three heads leaking the feds creeping I can hear them outside 
The sound of choppers, this could very well be the night that I die 
I rather fry before I let them enter 
I heard somebody on the loud speaker screaming surrender 
Nigga was fucked up from the dome a long way from home
No way to get out the beef from there 
Call all my niggas on the bitches phone, might not never see the streets again 
Tell them get here, creep up nigga, let yo bullets disperse
And if we die tonight they going first 
Holla at me my nigga

(Chorus)
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
Fuck it, I’m in this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
I come to bring the pain in this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How can I refrain from this shameless game
It’s gonna be a lotta slow singing and flower bringing
How I maintain
 
(12 o’klok)
Screaming surrender I say never bust through the window
Got guts falling from sweaters, tag-teaming with twin berettas ready for whatever 
Fuck it, my life is an illusion anyway
I realize that through the mist of this confusion, I can die anyday
No need to cry I gots to be free
Even if means blasting you just to save me
Do what I have to do daily 
Fuck all the cussing and fussing I’m strictly bussing
Go the PD on tv watching this shit get heated like ovens
Ain’t nothing gon bring back into the world that I came from
Ain’t scared of death, in fact I’m kind of waiting to see the day come 
They run, I laugh looking through this window with shattered glass 
Coppers all over trying to scatter fast from the aftermath
Stepping over them bitches in a flurry, tell my niggas hurry
Either we gon ride or get buried 
Pick a later time to worry 
Already got 3 dead niggas in front of me
System ain’t running me
I’m giving them all what they come to see
Mind full of madness
Only other alternative than doing time is in a casket
If I get blasted
Closing my eyes, I heard the door pop, beretta still cocked
It was foo telling the crew black they don killed klok
Carletta ran over to my side, eyes open wide
Saw I was bleeding but couldn’t tell from where the blood was releasing
But its time to ride, lifting me up, drug me outside 
Through the back basement, right there where the navigator was waiting 
We blazing, abdomen getting swole, feeling like flames
I need some of that beige shit to stop my fucking pain
In my brain the pictures getting blurried
Streets don got a nigga sick
I’m guessing that can be the only thing that kill me my nigga

Diabolic
Mentat
Foul Play

This is a game of cat and mouse where Tom murders Jerry
And Bush urges Kerry to rape Virgin Mary till he bursts the cherry
So I’m emerging every person in the dirt and buried to resurrect get a tech
And follow his mercenary
Paid in full, hate the haters take a poll with an army of raging bulls 
And wolves draped in wool
Got metaphors coming off the head like devil’s horns
Acting Foul, won’t crack a smile unless it’s yours
Backed against the wall close calls applying pressure
Eye & text ya, feed fiction to a lie detector
And I bet you I’ll rob anywhere near or next to me
Here essentially to take your prophet like the Spear of Destiny
I’ll appear as a guest for free really I can’t wait to see the look on your damn face
When I’m stealing your fan-base
I’m sick enough to hand Jake a trail of bread crumbs 
Lead a new murder scene with Rev Run chugging redrum
I set the tone like a metronome left alone
On top of the world, with the 3rd rock as a stepping stone
Inside the terror dome DNA tests have shown
I’m the truth; the rest are just genetic clones of my flesh and bones
That’s why fans react to the livest rappers
By jumping from the highest rafters in the crowd flying past us
The final chapters it was written read the text 
Or get beat to death and sent to hell where demons slept

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everyday I wake up at the dawn of Morning Light
Same shit different toilet, I got a water fight
So don’t ask me why I’m pissed of in every song I write
Cuz Diabolic’s been dealing with this shit all his life

I’m the style of weapon for a quite war
With the streets I’ve endured 
Where young bucks will stab you like it’s the VIBE awards
Connoisseur throw a comet towards New York’s rocking core
Open a hole in hell’s gate when Satan locks the door
Moment of truth, pop the 4 like Tupac Shakur
Chop the horns and mop the floor with his spinal cord
My soul is righteous but I’m likeness toking Viking 
Who’ll grab a cop and choke him lifeless with a broken night stick
I’m have a soulless cobra’s dome closed in vice grips
My fans build statues of me in Jehovah’s likeness
But I’m a cloud mine with fans of Dan Weathers’
See troubled knees buckle to beneath the air pressure
When Hip-hop was raw now it comes from wherever
Got some Jacob jewels, manicure and a hair dresser
The single reason demons creep in our shows
Is cuz my plans complete when I brand the beast with a barcode
Satan wants our souls offered as dirt cheap
But I ain’t selling shit like Jin’s album the first week
So make some noise for church priests raping boys
Demented choice to slit his throat when he raised his voice
Send me to hell fuck it cuz when I kick the bucket 
I’ll find who birth the anti-Christ and kick her in the stomach
So when motherfuckers shout at me and run they mouth
Add ‘em to the list of shit I don’t giva fuck about

[Chorus]

All my motherfucking life man
I’ve been at war; I’ve been a soldier on the front lines
Foul Play bitch
Wake the fuck up or get woke the fuck up

Diabolic
Mentat
Beat Asylum, motherfucka

I’ve been looking for that shadow that’s inside of me for quite some time
Sunk my teeth into life, as a young man blind
But never regret the process or regret time
Just wish I could have helped the three of us and breach that line
Like how the hell was I supposed to know?
It’s a symbiotic circle that we all helped grow
And when it all fell through
Yeah we all sunk in the same lake
And drowned in that vision of our future in the same day and
You can tell it to the doctor when he asks you
Or carve it in your little prison wall like a tattoo but
We got a frozen rock of luck like a statue
It stands at the cross roads blocking where to pass through
Damn, that’s part of livin’ on the off beat and
Part of skipping down that never-ending dark street so
You can fight it and draw the difference between us
Cos the blood doesn’t match but the god damn disease does

How many more hearts are we gonna break?
How many failed steps are we gonna take?
It’s time to look at what we got here
Standing on the verge of that age old question
Is it nature versus nurture?
How many more lines are we gonna cross
Until we figure out the pain we caused?
It’s time to look at what we got here
Standing on the verge of that age old question
Is it nature versus nurture?

I flip through that little photo book that Ma made
And look for the warning signs crawling out of my face
I’ve been questioning the level of our mind state
That made us feel like everything around us was a crying shame
No answers, just a whole bunch of burned bridges
Earned stitches and a curve in our world’s rhythm
And I don’t know where we learned this from
Or how it’s stuck with you after all the worst was done
But it scares me, yeah, and I’m not afraid to say it
I’m ready to wake the demon and enclose it up and face it
And take it out and display it and show the world that it’s real
Stop running from the past like it’s gonna make you heal
Cos it can’t, and maybe that’s the reason why I see it
And feel it in my pen when I sit down and treat it
And after all of it’s done, you don’t have to believe it
When the blood doesn’t match, and the god damn disease lives

How many more hearts are we gonna break?
How many failed steps are we gonna take?
It’s time to look at what we got here
Standing on the verge of that age old question
Is it nature versus nurture?
How many more lines are we gonna cross
Until we figure out the pain we caused?
It’s time to look at what we got here
Standing on the verge of that age old question
Is it nature versus nurture?

[McGruff]
Now check it, uptown kid on the record
Who you thought? Who you expected?
Gruff number one, get layed, lust in the sun
Now I’m gettin paid without bustin my gun
Make music, but still in I say boot it
But still in all I stay looted, still in all
I’m the slick cat that Heav’ recruited
No one see platinum and then play stupid
Harlem’s on the rise now, you surprised now
For those who slept, bet they recognize now
Can’t hold us, can’t stand to see my Ro’ wristband wit boulders
Can’t withstand my soldiers, told ya
We gon’ explode like Oklahoma
Put the rap game in the yoke and the coma
Feel fame comin closer, photograph name on poster
Dame in the Rover

[Chorus: Shay Best]
What cha doin to me? Keep comin baby
How you makin me feel, keep comin baby

[McGruff]
Yo give it to ya hardcore, but never raw baby
Be on tour crazy, leave shows wit three or four ladies
Tryin to stroke out, stand up, poke out
Let the smoke out, let the loke out
Sexin broke out, rock begets no doubt
Niggas wanna be playas but just no clout
Man bubbly refresh my mouth
besides that been fresh before fresh was out
Check it out, check my background, check how I’m layin my mack down
Check the store near you, for the hound phat sound
Herb could flow, you ain’t the first to know
Watch me burst and blow, cuz I’m thirst for dough
No question G, millionaire destined to be
Tucks no less than a g, who fresher than me?
Or Heavy D, check the pedigree
From uptown to Beverly, papes be steady, see

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: Heavy D]
Ooh rougher than rough, big M, little C, Gruff
You can’t get enough, say what

[McGruff]
Gruff official, what the deal nigga, bust the Crystal
Bust the style, baby lust the style
Dutch your Isle, knowhatimean? Philly two mile
Nowadays niggas really be foul
What’s goin on out there? Is all I hear
Black on black crime, and you know the law don’t care
War out there, almost got caught out there
But I didn’t, so I gotta thank the Lord out there, cuz there is one
Know people listen to my songs in they system
Know people think I don’t belong in prison
Lord forgive ‘em, please, for all that sinnin
Puffin weed and tossin women

[Chorus 2X]

[Madlib]
Keeps it poppin like West coast in ‘83
When we was bumpin Slave, Rick James and Lady T
My man with the East coast taste from Red Alert
Pete Rock, Marley Marl, put-tin in work
On the West we had Julio G on KDAY
Mixmaster Michael mixin more in his heyday
Rob 1 droppin shit so niggaz could break
All my real niggaz - all a nigga wanna do is get cake
All them other niggaz - all a nigga wanna do is be fake
But now - oh shit, damn I’m goin to another wake
Remember, ‘bout the times in school
When we made a fool of ourselves to impress a girl, tryin to be cool
Ohh, some niggaz gettin sprung on coke
I’m like oh, young niggaz gettin sprung off {*BLAM*}
Oh shit! Some niggaz never learnin the ropes
Ropes...

[scratching]
Keep this hustling up
I’m fucking you up
Talk all that
Fuck all that
Hardcore new V.R.
Mathematic, here in Cali, rally
Dirty, I can’t help it
I been an addict

[reggae voice]
Believe me! All massive an’ all crew line up
They can’t get we out

[Madlib]
(Who that nigga over there man?)
Niggaz lookin over here like shit is sweet
All day mad cause a nigga said his shit is weak
Askin for a true opinion, get mad when a nigga speak
I ain’t got no time for that shit, I already figure the nigga’s weak
You can’t even trust your own best friend or your man and them
Cause them niggaz only worry about the shit you handin them
Shit, all a nigga wanna do is get cake
All a nigga wanna do is be fake
Look around, all snakes, for heaven sakes
Buried with fake, I carry it hate, made in every state

Rock, ohh, ohh, uhh
Dilla Dawg
Madlib
Yeah
Ohh~! Ohh~! Dilla

[scratching]
Let’s build on it
Vintage Cadillac with the grill fronted
Totin in the BM-Dub
Tell them players I’m the GM

[reggae voice]
Believe me! That is the wickedest sound
that player had in him then use..
Down with all massive and all crew line up
They can’t get we out
When it come to championship - yes we ‘ave it
And when it come to dignitary
{*speaking too fast to translate*}

[Intro: Sample]:
It’s New York! I can make my most fantastic dreams, come true

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (Swizz Beatz vocals scratched by DJ Camillo) 
(DJ Camillo scratching samples from the original version on "En Why Cee")

This the remix we need it for the class
Of two thousand eight summer flew so fast
Juganot cookin they ass the whole reason
Cats get panic attacks they all wheezin
Tearin it down in each town do this for the people, this here is the sequel
Niggas is senile thinkin we ain’t about it
The reason we stressed cause we so overcrowded
Word! That’s the reason my city so violent
Word! We work two jobs to balance the absurd
Cost of livin your better give
A hundred and ten percent of an effort if, extra competitive
Kids stay in school, lay off the sedatives
Question the government in whatever they tellin us
We rebellious we back home we sayin leave Iraq alone! Uh huh! Yeah!
And put your hand in the air
If you wanna see your soldiers back at home
Come on!!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah! To give a fuck what niggas talk
If you ain’t know my whole jewelry collection is New York nigga
From drug spots to the strips they holdin the fort
In front of Pancho’s Deli burnin them phillies and Newports nigga
With the spirit of hustlers in hip hop was submitted
Home and origin and swag and the big chain was invented
The place is known I said it and light the fire and scorch
On some Statue Of Liberty shit we always carryin the torch
Block party properly put the speaker out on the porch
You know the type to dial up in the boroughs fuck what you thought
Tattoo and carve the city in my skin it could live with me
Out of town niggas rockin New York fitted religiously
It’s all good I respect the way niggas live it
Frontin and follow what we do like New York all in they spirit
I don’t think you niggas ready to play in this thug sport
Just get it right homey! It’s! New! York!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)

Cocaine City, boat game silly
I’ve been runnin these streets like I’m Diddy
You’ve been one of the niggas that could kill me
But they not, I’m still hot
More money more mansions more yachts
More bitches more whips more rocks
Independence Day, jackpot!
You couldn’t count how many m’s I got
Hundred guns hundred clips get the swag up
Oh they callin you a snitch bet you that sucks
New York big city of dreams
Get money keep feedin them fiends and I’m out

[Verse 4: Reek Da Villian]
N-E-W-Y-O-R-K!!!! I’m from Strong I-S-L-A-N-D
Where the crackheads will stick you up
Take a hit of the glass dick
Come through with that fifth and lit you up
Five boroughs of insanity
And them Jersey mu’fuckers like family
Where the ugliest chick will tell you she look like Amerie
Like Grace Jones sayin she favor Vanity
So, we quick to hit ‘em and diss ‘em like get lost
Kick her out with her clothes on backwards like Kriss Kross
Leave her with, more shit on her than Rick Ross
Like Lil’ Mama I enjoyed ya lip gloss
No matter the bridge the coupe will serve with it
Merge in it especially the CL to chirp in it
When we left the worms in it the apple was perfected
Now you smell the foulness in the air it’s your city New York

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Where the-Wh-Wh-Where-Where-Where The Bronx at?!
Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)
Where Queens at?! Is New York in the house say what now! (YEAH!)

(Some of you are not gonna like me)
(You better know it)
(That’s right)
(Y’all the truth, the whole truth and nothin but the truth?)
(You better know it)
(Some of you are not gonna like me)
(That’s right)

[ Yomo ]
Yo, it’s about time somebody address the situation at hand
We really need to do this, man
We really, REALLY need to do this
Uknowmsayin?

(Time is running out)
(Time is running out)
(Running, running, running... times have run out)

[ VERSE 1: Maulkie ]
Let’s get down to business
I’m from the way back
Where the brothers don’t play that
On the reel we’re equal
Check it
It’s life and death, damn, there’s no sequel
It’s gettin rougher
The Man’s gettin closer
Back up, chump, it ain’t goin like that
I’m fightin blck, cause I’m black, yes, man
God damn, I’m in demand
Where’s my 40 acres and my mule?
I didn’t get it, no sweat, cool 
I went for what I knew, and it had to be good
Rule 4 from the hood
As I stood and showed the flex
The fed and the mob were placin bets
So, put your money on a sure thing
And watch the static that I bring
(Bring the noise!)\t--> Chuck D
Cause in the cell, the pen, is where they wanna store me
Smellin piss, and gettin sick, gee
This is the red, the white, the blue
Your man Uncle Sam and his Uncle Tom crew
Gamin this stuff like they’re playin Monopoly
Sho’ enuff there’s gonna be a catastrophy
Genocide in progress
Keepin brothers in tune mode as I manifest
Finest of the last, can you dig this?
To say what the hell I feel I went Ruthless
Times have changed, hate remains
Since the age of 12 all I felt was pain
By the dawn’s early light
America’s situation is not bright
No matter how much they ignore me
They can’t, cause I can say: burn Old Glory

[ VERSE 2: Yomo ]
All a brother got is his name
Plus the nine he bought
To survive in the asphalt
J-u-n-g-l-e story
Man, burn Old Glory
A mule, 40 acres, and all that
Uncle Sam, step the hell back
So now the USA wants to trip
Cause a brother with a grip
Said ‘eff you’ and some
Kinda feel like holdin out for ransom
Now if I drive a Mack truck through your house
He burn a flag and you’re quiet as a church mouse
Like the sands of time I was surfacin poor
Till this Glory stuff ain’t no more
Some say blacks should ever be so thankful
And stand behind a rectangle
A red, white and blue, blue, white and red
A brother dead, bucked in the head
All because a bitch is America
Yeah, I’m tellin you...
To turn the other cheek is weak
So some speak
And activist activates and finds fate
So eff Mister S-a-m
Cause I know he said eff me
And everybody in the g-
h-e-double t-o l-i-f-e
That’s where my people been left, see
I couldn’t see myself in Iraq
Because that’s wack
For the simple fact that I’m black
So I shouldn’t serve, or better slave, yeah, you know the story
I got the urge to say burn Old Glory

( *as fire crackles in the background* )
(I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all)

[ VERSE 3: Maulkie ]
One nation under a rock
Yo, I’m one brother that the system won’t clock
It’s a game, check the scene
Tell me, what the hell is the American Dream?
Apple pie, baseball and blue skies
A county check, have kids, and then die
But me and Yo will reconstruct
With hi-top Jordans, kickin suckers in the butt
First in line is a mack named Bush
It seems like all my brothers he wanna push
In the Marines, Army and Navy
Eatin potatos and runny-ass gravy
Pimp them brothers like hoes in Iraq
You sold em weapons, now you want your money back
Human lives down the drain
Now tell me: who’s really insane?

[ VERSE 4: Yomo ]
Ignorance and one big rep
History repeats itself, so what the hell I got left?
Freedom of speech, freedom to teach
Freedom abreached
But I can’t cuss when I bust
See, there goes Glory again, stickin her nose where it don’t belong
Messin with my rap song
Censorship and the whole nine
See, they wanna restrain anything against the grain
Glory, glory, glory how I screw ya
And Uncle T-o-m can straight c-o-m-e
With it, or forget it and just quit it
Come correct or get clowned
Cause you ain’t down
With me and my same
See, we the only imigrants forced here in boats and chains
Yeah, there goes the neighborhood
Gee, burn Old Glory
End of story; we out

Burn Old Glory

[ Yomo ]
We are not in a time of disorder
And disorder is now the time
Knowmsayin?
[ Maulkie ]
Indeed

[Off Topic]
This is the epilogue to "Mark Of The Beast"
Track 13
Now that it’s digested
Lay me down to sleep
I woke up rested
Took a deep breath and blew the sickness out of my chest
Healed myself
And stack the deck before I get dealt
Live off the government
Strapped in tight for mental health
Freed up my schedule when I put the pedal to the metal
Cruised the mall like Elwood Blues
With no seat belt
Fueled by the fear of insecurity
Narcissism reigns supreme in our society
Get money
Evolve slowly one-by-one
Sweet equilibrium is reached
When release what we achieve
Oh, the irony
Struggle at every level
To control the forces
That cause us to conform
And divorce our psychosis
So who’s ready?
Nobody
We don’t want to die
And if we do, we want to live on in other peoples’ minds
Frozen in time
Trying run a circle on a timeline
And when you reach the top your definition is redefined
So keep trying
Til I engineer a pig to fly
And we can all saddle up and ride
Touch the sky
I’m just a regular guy who’s tapped in to something else
Like you, alive
In the fight to preserve myself
Even if I gotta kill everybody else
In a death-cult suicide
I survive

[Off Topic]
If I face duality in my reality
I foresee a long list of casualties
At my feet
Got the power of persuasion
In the strength of my speech
Download the bandwagon
And I’ll take you down with me
Grammatical, mathematical, tight precision
If my calculations prove correct
I’m in prison
And the faster they try to run from me
I keep with them
Nobody’s out of my reach
I will get them
And I’m more powerful dead
Immortal symbolism
They’re not equipped to handle my shit
They’re off rhythm
And the bad vibes resonate deep into the system
When they finally catch on nobody’s even going to miss them
Now, how many names do you know from a thousand years ago
That didn’t lead a million people to war?
Or, stumble onto something so deep
They were killed for their beliefs?
I’m doing both, so may I rest in peace
And at my funeral play back the "Prodigal" beat
With freestyles courtesy of Rhyme Network emcees
Kavorkian, Klutch, Rummage, V, Phase, and Greek
Let Snake Money eulogize me on Technics

[Off Topic]
Focus and discipline
Make us more than men
Perfect specimens
Homo sapiens
Always unlearning
They find me concerning
So my records are burning
So many heads are turning
Trying to decode my sermon
But it’s on you
Who murdered JFK?
Look at the burning Pentagon pictures
Where was the plane?
Iraq and Vietnam war, one and the same
While the South was left to drown in a series of hurricanes
I spell doom
They’re getting sloppy and cocky
I can smell the change coming
Like I sense the man that shot me
And they can’t stop me
It’s already too late
I got a plan stronger than fear
Stronger than hate
Get at them on a level they can’t contemplate
In the fifth dimension
With my general Phase Fate
My troops sing a requiem mass at day break
To announce the next age as we pass through the gates

Uh, yeah
Y-O
King Phaze
Yonkers {{echoed}}
Let’s get it

[King Phaze]\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

Line ‘em up, I annihilate ‘em
Hard like the white boys that listen to Iron Maiden (What up)
Hoppin in the mosh pit, leavin with the iron blazin (I’m leavin)
I’m the motherfuckin highest patient
Ask Phaze that I can’t be fazed (What up Phaze)
It ain’t a phaze, knock rocks while we blowin the haze

Got the devil on the guitar, the reaper on the drum (It’s deep)

Smoke comin out the door when I light up my piffin
Tommy Lee, nah this Donnie G (Sheek Louch)
Don Gorilla, X, King Phaze and P (Let’s Go)
Blacked out Night Rider in the SRT
One deep with the range it could fit all three (Let’s go baby)
I ain’t seen a nigga hidin till I look in the mirror
I’m an ol’ skool baller like Yogi Berra
Potato on the gun make it hard to hear ‘em
I run this shit I can’t say it more clearer (Y-O)
Bookbags, spray paint black marker (Hip-Hop)
I’m tattooed up like Travis Barker
Y’all funny muh’fuckers like Meet the Fockers (Ha ha)

[Chorus: 2x]

[DMX]
Sky’s the limit so I’m reachin for the stars (Uh)
I’m tired of being the nigga that they keep behind bars (Uh)
What’s good? You got it? I’ma take yours (Yeah)
I’m hood, fuck a gun I break jaws (What)
Understood, there’s nothing to bang for the cause (Uh)
And I could cause you couldn’t bang with the fours (Come on)
Home of the brave nigga, take it to the grave nigga
Beat to the streets (What) straight out the cave nigga (Wooo)
Start off from School Street, aight let’s roll (Come on)
Goin up ahead, up Palisades, hit the hole (Bap)
Y-O nigga, that’s what I’m reppin (Yeah)
Threw on the bullshit, keep on steppin (Yeah)

Yonkers {{echoed}}

Tis the season for certain types
of inner-city dwellers and suburbanites
to observe the nights of the birth of Christ
work the lights and buy merchandise
and when the Bourbon strikes and the fire is blazin’
those of us of the Christmas persuasion
eat gingerbread like Hansel and Gretel
and settle as we revel in some Christmas specials
Ladies tolerate me - I’m wearing O’Shea
I’m looking taller lately, I’m Keyser S\xc3\xb6ze
Christmas is the time of year that we watch Christmas shows
so as soon as your family leaves take off your Christmas clothes and

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I’m watchin’ TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

Pee-Wee’s having a party at the Playhouse
but what will Topanga lay out?
Hit the dog track, bet on Santa’s Little Helper
"Ebenezer Screw" - Beavis working at the shelter
Uncle Jesse locked in the toy store attic
Sing-a-long Mr. Hankey’s Christmas classics
Bing Crosby and David Bowie
Holy Holy, act like you now

Commercial break

Santa’s life I’m livin’ it
show me a tree I’m trimmin’
bought a gift and I’m givin’ it
but first I gotta ribbon it
paper I gotta glitter it
little more than a little bit
pretty so when they rippin’ it
they most likel won’t litter it
tag who will deliver it
To/From in a limerick
quick so when I’m spittin’ it
little kids are illiterate
cold, so when I’m still in it
they M&M; and Skittles
quivering just a little bit
like "Damn, Chaz, you killin’ it"
I’m drillin’ in a Christmas special, yall could never hate it
Stop-motion animation, Gonzo narrate it
putting up a tree, now we gotta decorate it
this song is an ornament, you can commemorate it
I’m Mr. Chaz Kangas, I’m Mr. Rap
get a get-right pass at midnight mass
so that holly-jolly ass gets tapped and...

Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
I’m watchin’ TV
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
Have Christmas with me now
cool as a stocking stuffer

We’re. Here. To
Bring the people all the music and deliver all the presents now
They. See. Through
Repetitive etiquette when it isn’t holly-jolly now
This. Is a necessary change, from the old simple and plain
here to exercise that brain and break the chain and break your candy canes

Si la ves dile que aun la quiero
y que estoy desesperado porque vuelva junto a mi
Si la ves dile que no la he olvidado, no
y que lloro como un ni\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1o desde que se fue de aqui
Y dile que ya no soy igual
que estoy muriendo
y que me cuesta respirar
Dile que sin ella yo me he vuelto loco
y que mi vida se va poco a poco

[Cruzito]
Ya no me siento igual que ayer
nena yo te quiro entender
Tu me dejastes solo aqui
dime porque, baby
Si la vez, dile que la sigo esperando
que me siento bien en sus brazos
y este hombre no puede vivir sin estar junto a ti ooooh, nooo
Si la vez, dile que la sigo esperando
que me siento bien en sus brazos
y este hombre no puede vivir sin estar junto a ti
Ooooh nooo, Ooooh nooo, Ooooh nooo
Que este hombre no puede vivir sin estar junto a ti

[Ken-Y]
Dime que hago si no dejo de pensar en el calor de tus brazos
mi corazon esta en pedazos
Si la vez, dile que aun la quiero
Y que yo extrano sus besos
y que no aguanto esta tormenta que me mata a fuego lento, Ooooh No
Y que no aguanto mas, no la he dejado de extranar
dile que siempre la voy a esperar hasta el dia en que vuelva
Que vuelva, que vuelva, que vuelva
hasta el dia que vuelva!

Si la ves dile que aun la quiero
y que estoy desesperado porque vuelva junto a mi
Si la ves dile que no la he olvidado, no
y que lloro como un ni\xc3\x83\xc2\xb1o desde que se fue de aqui

Run up in his office
Toss his computer off his desk - cross his mouth with tape and let these Rugers off at his head
If we escape

But I stress the fact that I rap to get that scrilla - and if I feel this shit ain’t workin
then ima get that Milla - Nigga kill the
speakers

turn up all my crime

huntin’ down my incitive wit a fourty-four - spark it in cartridges 
in his ear exploding

"ITS TIME TO RIDE"..

[Z-Ro talking]
Yes indeed, H-Town, it go down Lil’ Flex, Z-Ro, Big Mello
Know what I’m saying, you boys can’t stop us man
Unstopable, feel me, yeah
They got to feel us till they kill us, this for the radio

[Lil’ Flex]
Ain’t nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can’t fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of y’all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I’m a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I’m the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I’m about to drop 22’s on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

[Chorus]
Still standing, and you know we represent the south
And ya know ya know we represent the south 
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can’t keep us out

[Big Mello]
I represent that S-O-U-T-H to the S-I-D-E
Drop screens you can see me completely
Off the heezy, fa sheezy I’m breezy
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie
Believe me, outstanding with my family
From me and Z-Ro and Lil’ Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four’s now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don’t stop
Won’t stop, how it go down
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Screwed up representer these fellas don’t want none
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain’t having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can’t see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That’s the studio and bro you know ain’t no more selling crack
Ain’t nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain’t that
Cause I’m a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it’s third coast, to me our music mean the most
Big Mello and Lil’ Flex and Z-Ro the crooked as your folks and we

[Chorus - 2x]

[Piano Intro]
Sometimes I feel like I’m alone
But you are there
I’ll stay real close to you
Sometimes I feel like I’m alone
Since you are there
I’ll stay real close to you

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus]
If you wanna kick it with me tonight
I’ll take you home (I’ll take you home)
And baby when I turn off all the lights
That thing is on

[Mo B. Dick]
Baby come next to me
We got a mutual feeling and it’s ecstacy
Don’t ask why
cus I feel your vibe
the way your lookin at me
I know it’s on your mind
slow dance
thinkin of romance
when I look in your eye you put me in a trance
if you please
come home with me
we can make this one night into eternity

[Chorus]

[Mo B. Dick]
Ooh-wee you’re so sexy
You can’t imagine the things that you do to me
come on girl
I want you in my world
You got me tweakin for you like I’m on that {?}
You and I
we can wine and dine
the feelin tells me that I’m trickin for you but baby I don’t mind
so what you gonna do
we wont become for you
forget the rest of the world
It’s all about me and you

[Chorus]

I can take you for a trip around the world in one night baby

{*a parody of Ludacris’ song "Area Codes"*}

[Chorus]
I got probed!  I got probed...
aboard a UFO (U-F) UFO (Oh!)
Probed, proohhhhbed..
aboard a UFO (U-F) UFO (Oh!)

[Verse One: Tom Rockwell - Sudden Death]
Now you thought it was just on TV, and on the big screen
It’s worldwide, biggest problem that I’ve ever seen
It’s the intergalactic dog catcher
Bug eyed extra-terrestrial master with a diminutive stature
+Men in Black+, cut up cows
I got crop circles formin out behind my house
9:01, Thursday night was a real hoot
I was dragged out of bed like a dead prostitute
I was brought aboard ship, looked like a Ford truck
Stripped down to my drawers, what a run of poor luck
Big gray heads, big black eyes
"Uh, what’s goin on? What’s up guys?"
They came at me with a mallet and a big syringe
And a pointy thing that would make a dentist cringe
Metal prongs, big round gears
They just jammed the thing into my ears

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Tom Rockwell - Sudden Death]
Now every night they pick me up again
Just to do a Roto Rooter on my rear end, leavin me in pain again
I’m all scarred up, I’m missin teeth
9-1-1 thinks I’m a freak
They shove ‘em up my nose, they shove ‘em in my butt
And this corkscrew device gets shoved in my belly button
3 days straight, 2 long probes
Shoved in places nothin should go
They drill holes in my head, and later on
I always wake up back in my bed, and they’re gone
Why do they always pick on people from the South
What do they learn by shoving a big plunger in my mouth
Man, after a night of being prodded and poked
I just feel like a guy who had a massive stroke
I got alien troubles out back
And I don’t mean the type that we can send back

[Interlude]
Is it cause they like my trailer park (trailer park)
Is it cause they like my beauty marks (beauty marks)
Is it cause they like my handsome face (handsome face)
Is it cause they like the way I taste (way I taste)
Wherever I go, they find me and they just won’t let me be
They want me to pee, don’t rush me just relax and it’ll flow free
Whenever I call, the Enquirer to my house so they can see
You know that they all, stop comin so nobody will believe me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hey, what’s that big light in the sky?
Oh, come on - not again, guys
I just got my nose working again
Well at least let me bring a camera this time
C’mon guys, please
J-just leave me alone for a while

[Speech]
Yeah? Yo we was talkin earlier and I was
I was tellin you, I was talkin ‘bout life
And I.. I feel like life is really just like braided hair
Cause it’s, it’s got like twists
Y’know, you know about braidin? Heh
Like twists you know, three strands twist together
Ultimately you get to where you gonna get to, y’know

[Verse One]
From the same dirt, from the hills of my ancestors
The naked rows and the fields where the pain festered
I wonder where the hole came from
In the deeps of my heart, make me yearn for the drum
It’s the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
It’s the place where the floss was yearned
Gold teeth and bling ice on the rings baby sure

[Chorus: Neneh Cherry + Speech]
Yo we all got things that hangin about
Things that make us cool, things that make us whack
Things that make us mad
Things we wish we never had... done
But they’re just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids like hair
Until we all get there

[Verse Two]
I like that I don’t know some mysteries
Ancient things and beginnings
Excited ‘bout the day when I don’t have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease
In the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these brais with the twists and turns

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Neneh Cherry]
Walkin in the race of life, lookin for my own pace
Not always wantin to, but I have to
Sometimes feelin like I’ve bitten off much more than I can chew
But the wind goes though my hair
And lifts me up with ease, not a crease
Hair full of grease, no weave embracin me
It’s you I see
I am you and you are me I see, yeah

{*African chanting interlude*}

I am you and you are me I see, yeah

[Speech - repeat to fade]
We might survive as brothers yeah or perish here as fools
Go place your bets; but don’t bet too soon
Yeah you might find me in another, feels like someone you once knew
You know that face, yeah we all do

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus]
Puff puff pass nigga lets all
puff puff pass nigga lets all
puff puff pass nigga lets all
If you don’t pay you don’t smoke

(Young Lay)
See I puff then pass through the cuts
Got to make the dash
Lit another blunt hurry up fetch had to come and get
Split it’s kind of hart to take the losses
Quickly had to brake ya’ll now I’m thinking ya’ll slice the sweet
And quickly rolled it up got to catch you fold it up
In the green with the heat of my cup
Stupid stuff but all my cudees blaze wit me
And when they blaze young lay get’s way dizzy
I’m feeling tipsey so you know I’m feeling perk
Walk through the club seeing sister on with some tight skirts
But what I got on ya a sack black lips and lungs
I got what I got to stack hunds and ones
Now I know why they wanna see me up state
Going to prisions for descisions that should don’t make
You gone brake cuz the county you in ain’t no joke
You can bounce when you want

Chorus

(Young Lay)
I come from a family of three sprung on the sticky green
I hit the spot and said it don’t stop but repeat
Yale gets caught and yale gets off
One of my tapes run around thinking lay soft
They bootsey trick’em fools all I wanted juice 
while homies sell and flaunt keys
And we stay deeper than some vietnamese
When the microphone is on the rhyme hit some rushing up some fine chicks
While cudees yelling rewind this
It’s critical homies calling me on a digital phone
To know what’s going on am I coming home or what
I was living way plush young lay must
Stacking g’z and come clean on capris candy
I see my family running away from these folks
Down with young lay and qude downless flode
And roll another jay but in the swiss a sweet
In the grass I down with wax with ten sacks and bags

Chorus

(Young Lay)
My indo indo spot it just don’t stop everytime I go to wit
Dank we let her hold it in than roll another spliff
Splurred by professional scenes I mean the punk police
Who always want to front on me they coming around when I’m keyed
Thinking that we some hood rats I got some good yat
Base to make your crack blu I rap with interior black
Hear me coming watch me scat who is he where he be
I heard he got a lil scratch but young lay ain’t all that
Love to see him fall flat smash and check to the curb
I’m with the clock stack with junkie key can keep the glock on the turn
Dubiees with herb all smashed in the ash tray
Now rollers wanna tail gait I put them on lay away
Cuz lay through this everyday I try to mash in another way
And now there wondering if this gangster  stay
But like a truff I clock some gluff high up in my playa suit
Fine hoes and daisy dukes gonna jock me cuz these crazy fools

Chorus

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo.. It’s Vinnie Paz baby my man Panik on the track! NAMEAN! NAMEAN!
I’m bout to take yall to war. Teach yall how to rhyme. Check it out
YO YO
 
[Verse 1]
We heavenly divine, thats why we steadily shine
and put a steel mic through a enemy spine

Yall easier to fuck with than white bitches

Yall mafuckas is never right like southpaws
Thats why I doubt yall, yall aint raw

Hook (2x):

YALL SPILL BLOOD ON SLUGS FROM ALL WEAPONS!
VINNIE PAZ! I’M LIKE THE LORD’s RESURRECTION!
IT’S ALL ENDING! SO BRING THE GOD WHEN I STEP IN!
 
[Verse 2]
You’re forced to fight, when I’m scorching the mic

but still, my clique is too ill
and yall? yall more bitch than Dru Hill
the true skill that come through me,
Is from banging "All Hell Freeze" by Cool C

with the digital trigger finger like the letterman
the vendetta gram, I know where my heart’s at
I’m the better man, so dont start that
when we bomb back.. BURN FUCKIN LEECHES
send you to hell to see more shells than beaches
we elitists, we from Hamburger Hill
science and math combined with supreme skill
the team ill, we send you to hell fast
your cream build, you buried in Belfast

‘cuz aint too much muthafuckers rockin with Vin!
stomp him with tims, ‘cuz I heard he hate hell
the last thing that he saw? a .38 shell
 
*hook*

You spend your lonely days lookin’ for someone
I just wanna be the one that makes your river run
I know it ain’t so fun bein all alone
And I know you wonder when you’ll find yourself a home
You ain’t foolin’ no one baby
See you don’t believe in you

But I do
Yeah I do
Oh I do
Yeah I do

If you want some company
I don’t mind a ride
I don’t want your money baby
And I don’t want your pride
You might think I’m crazy
You just might be shy
I think this is good for us
But I could just be high

We can make this happen baby
I believe that’s true

Yeah I do
Yes I do
Oh I do
Yes I do

You keep on lookin’ baby
I hope it’s all too sweet
I hope its fairy tales
And everything you dream
But just remember that we ain’t all this kind
When you get tired of lookin’ baby I ain’t hard to find

Your wastin’ all your time out there
Cuz they don’t care about you

But I do
Yeah I do
Oh I do
Yeah I do
Oh I do
Yeah I do

[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
This one, for them fake cats, fronting like it’s all love
Running round, thinking shit sweet, yo
This one, for them words that wanna break my stride
Canive, smile and they wish I died, yo
This one, for them niggas with scared money amongst me
That love to see me bleeding in the street, though
This one, for them crackers trynna beat me ‘cross the head
With that bullshit, it’s on the heart, yo, this one

[Joe Mafia]
Fuck rap nigga, straight off the record
I hold western, stink and petty get you cough in me
Lollypop kids do bids, and come home willing
Third stripe pending felongs, pumping on wellon
Niggas talk more than bitches, wooly poot niggas
Suit niggas, straight tie and suit niggas, shoot niggas
Pissy drunk, dice games in the bootleg of this one
Stack your funds, hold guns, and school bitches, duke, listen
Ain’t nothing new, I seen your kind before, do the math
Fuck you got a screwface for? You a candy ass
Cash ya ass off a couple of packs, palm spitting
Million dollar raps relax, my name ringing
Jingling, got strength, plus ya mob respects, and nines and techs
All my real niggas dead or in the state correct’, keep the cake correct
Bang the shit up in your whip until you break your neck
Niggas straight up respect, dude, sorry, I got money
It’s funny, after fucking with you, fronting with crumsb, see
Edward Scissorhands, your plans, and snatch ass with it
I left you warning with a dun, and cats, it’s best opinion

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
I got that fire and I ain’t fronting with it
If you ain’t down with this, then you ain’t fucking with it
That’s how I feel for real, ain’t nothing else to that, but
Drugs and sluts, you can get touched
Niggas need to collapse, slash, the Cash Rule
Divine ruled, universal twerking, networking
Fool got something to prove, moving out fast
No doubt’ll blow out, get your wig blown out
Up inside a house, four thousand and a chrome out
Trey pizzy, under the T, la smoke out
Tank cats deserve curves, they cheating, yo
And I ain’t satisfied til niggas is eating, yo
Get it from the rough, scoop it up, recoup
Snatch pies from the chicken coup, we rule, get it in the duke shoe
Whipmaster, what they call me
Hit ‘em with a nina of... if they call me

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
I do this with a jones, like I’m strung out and need a fix
On some real shit, dog, you frog, nigga, eat a dick
How you cross me up and butt, like I ain’t see the shit
City slicker, uptown gift, I ain’t for no pimping
Fucker, friend all up in my shit, you ain’t gorilla
Greener than a head of cabbage, faggot ass rap nigga
Caught up in the mix, cuz, get tricked up
All out for this one, doing them dirty, damn to get them
In the hood with backwoods, all good, lace your Timbs up
Trump hold a Massberg pump, while I get slumped
Broad day, hustling in hallways, a stress pump
Official missile, shutting it down, if your shit slump
Niggas catching licks with six bitches, who kicks fucking
Crab clicks posing as dicks, stick to the script, cousin
Scrape it up, so we can cake it up, and get the spot jumping
Nigga, I done seen it and done it, run it, this one

[Chorus]

[Pleasure P - Chorus]
When I Come over
I ain’t comin to play no games
When I come over
You betta be ready for me
li-lingire, sliky lace
Turn off the phone cuz ima turn ya on
When I come over
We gone make this a night to remember

Baby girl when you gonna let me beat it up
Treat you like a entree girl and eat it up
You wont talk wit ya legs in the air
Pullin’ on your hair
Girl I know you like it rough
Cuz you into that freaky stuff
Baby come over whenever you wanna
Baby girl I’m gonna, put it on ya
And I cant lie shawty hotter than the Arizona summer
And she get it from her mama
You can hit me on a late night tip
I heard you can drive a stick
Ima shift ya gear lil mama tell me if ya can handle it
And I make a baby come fast
Ima beast in the sheets when it comes to the bedroom
Ima go down low, go lick a lil bit
Yeah shawty,thats what a real man do
We gon smoke a blunt or two
Then get right back at it, fuckin like rabbit
All night long with an RnB song
Your sex like a drug n girl I’m yo addict
All you gotta do is call me up
And Ima go deep cuz its long enough
We can do it in the kitchen, or the shower
Cuz it dont matter, in the living room on the furniture

[Chorus]

Girl take yo thong off
If ya dont know now baby girl ima super freak
Forget cha home girl, cuz you all mine and ya girl with Pleasure P
Oow man she soaking wet
Girl we can film it and upload it onto the internet
And the way nigga beat it from the back
You screamin my name, kissin on ya girl, and bitin ya neck
Knockin picture off the wall
And she go both way, thats right, like girl too
? no girl I love you
Let me tell ya whatcha gon do
Lay back on the bed
Clenchin the sheet tight while she givin me head
Man I swear to god I aint never had nothing like this before
And she make a nigga wanna go
Break up with his wife, change his life
She call me up anytime the night
Ima come over, lay the pipe, whatever she like
When I come over she already know what time it is
No talking girl, thats right, lets get it poppin then

[Chorus]

[chorus]
come jump in my Escalade
I’m so drunk I forgot my name
all I wanna do is get laid

[repeat]

[Romes 1st verse]
Baby you beautiful you dress so provocative
but why the hell you gotta be so damn talkative
Yo stories too long yo skirt is short
Yo homegirls makin me dizzy smoking dem new ports
Now I been drinkin me and marques at the bar
And I hope the henny aint makin you look like super star
Cuz I aint tryna wake up flippin and mad
wit a broad who resembles Donovan McNabb
My homey black told me you was a dime plus
You smelled so good that you cleared his sinus
Lips so full keep my helmet shined up
Girl lets go somewhere nobody can find us
Coo whats yo name again
Jeremy, Jerrod, Jerome
All I kno my last name is Jones
Girl believe me when I through witchu
I guarantee you’ll forget yo name too oo

[chorus 2x]

[Romes 2nd verse]
yo bodys vicious, delicious momi blowin me kisses

back seat of my jeep lets swing a episode
hold up let the cd change and load
im bout to let you have it to Lenny Cravits girl
lets pretend this escalade seat is a craftmatic
im like a jack rabbti I hope you aint asthmatic
baby just drop yo thong like a bad habbit

and after the back shots its time to go
back into V.I.P actin as nothing happened holla

[Chorus 2x]

[Smooth verse]
I kno you wanna hit, get up in it and kill it
So you can run back and tell yo homies how we did it
My booty firm and chunky I ride it like a donkey
Skeet skeet stop frontin boy you kno you want me
You wanna turn me out, turn me ova, turn me on
turn me into a freak and get me started like a motor
You kno I cant stop let me get on top
My booty jiggle like jello on the real watch

[Chorus]

[Intro] [MURS talking]
I don’t know where-where the sixteen is

[MURS]
Huh, here we come 
It’s the California kid
A rugged raw rhyme spitter
Certified real nigga
Coolin’ in Cali like Muggs in a blizzard
You, yesterday’s news like Tommy Hillfiger
On the cover of Rap Pages
Rap is so primitive, we back to the black ages
Should I say it’s dark?
Invaded by these marks
Busters and herbs
Gettin’ just what they deserve when I thrust these verbs
It’s a way of life when I slay this mic
You couldn’t see me like ? whether day or night
Height, is not an issue
I still get with you
5’8 and three quarters of I-ain’t-afraid-to-diss-you
Complex, Napoleon Dynamite
Rhymin’ like you lookin’ at your wrist
Tryin’ to find if the time is right
That means checkin’ y’all
Now inspect these bars
At the end of the day I want respect that’s all

[Karniege]
One get’s them warmed up
Two get’s it started
Handicap your camp with kids retarded
Ninjas in the party disguised as crash dummies
Walked out, bust out with mo’ mo’ money
It’s time for change like quarters on a clock
My finger’s got minutes, I’m callin’ the shoots
Big kids make moves
You can get rocked like mountain climbers
Avalanche dancin’
Tumble on the Earth
Survival? No chances
Whatever the season, my thoughts rain there like guerrilla monsoons
Loot of vixin’ and Brandson
Spit a witty buck fifty that’ll tickle you bastards
Bow and arrows verses rifles I’m both
Either way I’m makin’ hits with eyes closed
Silly cats shootin’ Billy Blanks, my Tae-Bo
Flows been psycho ever since high school

[Vast Aire]
Vast’s flow can turn men to mice
If reality’s a whore, I’m fuckin’ her twice
And on the third time, she’ll be screamin’ my name
And her best friend Truth will tell you the same
I’m the same chubby kid with a Bruce Lee poster
That’ll finger pop a bitch to check the odor
That’s ill, they put coke in soda?
Naw, what’s ill is I, practice with Yoda
My people rep the sun cause they’re dark
Only in the skin, not in the heart
I’m a Nubian native
Indian archer
That’ll do a rain dance for the Cherokee loss
Navajo loss
Apache loss
Shit, even the Hebrew that died on the cross
Remember black was first, so it’s beautiful
I ain’t 3/5th
I’m the millennium general

.
.
[King Mez]
This how you end it
 
Uh, a young King, always I had known it
but didn’t know what to call it, maybe I telephone it
I just knew that I was different, wasn’t livin for moments
{?} Gotti’s tone, I ain’t, nobody’s clone
I mean, I want that throne, it ain’t gotta be the main one
Just as long as don’t nobody livin got the same one
So I keep utensils closed, my pen is my brain’s gun
Momma told me, "When you ‘bout yo’ business, boy you bring one"
So, this is the close as you get to seein me unprepared
Because I won’t be, so lyrically tryna fold me
My writtens is called a fractional, slippin is called subtraction
My mission is causin action, these country niggas is slackin
Yeah, do all that crackin when they was callin ‘em wack
And cheatin all of his raps and distraction writin in classes
Now you see how they actin, see and feel all that passion
All them cameras flashin, couldn’t even imagine how I feel
...Growing into my title
No way, from any rival, they auto think of survival
Because they know that I’m libel to hop up on tracks and embarrass ‘em
Faces be avacado, honestly homey I know
If you ain’t got no pain, you will not understand like I do
I won’t do this in vain, it ain’t no blood on me and my crew
I won’t be part of chains, I’m too intelligent to follow
I got heart, you niggas hollow! Just call me Rollow
 
[Phonte]
Yeah...it’s Phontigga
King Mez, waddup? Young Khrysis on the beat
And nigga, I cut yo’ shit in half ‘cause I ain’t feel like waitin
 
Uh, wack verses, I don’t own one
Bullshit is not in my possesion, and that’s without a question
Word to Kweli and Khrysis dawg, +I’m On One+
Sprint like a Kenyan, I’m in it for the long run
Ask me for your opinion, we all got a strong one
I’ve been livin with ‘em since I made song one
back in ‘99, but for praise I do not live
Spit it like Yoda, a FUCK I do not give
I’m on a high still, I’m overpowerin
Phontigga towerin, all over you niggas like the Eiff-el
I will kill this, still it’s rap niggas
claimin they sick with no symptoms of illness
You clear for work, hoe nigga, go and get a job
or hit the net and cry about it - fuck it, get a blog!
I be sangin but with rap, shit I’m still involved
Make ‘em say, "Chu’uch~! ?Mostenveur? Synagogue" 
This is what I’m in it for, I can taste the dreamers
I pace the ring, gettin ready for the title, wait-
I’m co-starring, sparrin with King Mez 
I show love to the young Gs’, they help me stay in fightin shape
North Carolina is back on the bih’ness
‘til all competition get back on the benches
Take off my Fedora, put back on the fitted
Like this y’all, this fall, I’m back on you niggas!
Eh-hahaha, yeah...

Oh
Mmm Mmm Mmm

Bambi, Bambi
My dear, my dear, my dear
My dear I want you here
Don’t get too near for there’s lions beware

Oh Bambi I won’t lie
If I weren’t in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it’s my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don’t wanna hurt my dear love of my life

Bambi, Bambi
My dear, my dear, my dear
My dear I want you here
Don’t get too near for there’s lions beware

Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
Cause I’m afraid to look back in your eyes
I’m terrified you were love of my life
The woman among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I’ll drink alone in my hotel and cry
Cause now they know you are love of my life

Bambi, Bambi
My dear, my dear, my dear
My dear I want you here
Don’t get too near for there’s lions beware

I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between love and many I’m loving one
I got the wedding invitation Bambi
I’m happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church
There screaming your name Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi

Bambi, Bambi
My dear I want you here
Oh baby don’t get too near
No there are lions beware

You be like the type that come at me

Outlaws we ‘trol heat
Ya cold feet remain frozen

Wearin’ fitted and blue chain
The one out of these two thangs
Hustle or be hustled,

They sheaths hunt you down
When you around and ya knees buckle
Popped up, whopped up, glock cocked up
An’ got ya cop shot up,
Came to shook shop up
I took money, gave ‘em horror
Recruit crooks for me
Keep my finger on strap,
‘Til the gat looked ugly
I mash fast illy
G-packers get bagged silly
We pack mac millis
You know the science for that
These niggas tryna rap
When I spit it like I’m committed
Wid triple and double digits
Bag whatever bubble wid it
All y’all gon’ do is be talkin’ while I walk
Wid the war you ball way
Either way you playin’ ya partner
Watch me bop down ya block
Wid my suit and chocolates
On some Deathrow Pac shit

Ain’t seein’ a damn bit ah coke
You might be bangin’ yaself
Talk that crew shit,

Pack one nasty new wid, a lil’ bit of blue shit

This goes out to my family, close ones
Don’t give up! You’re alive for a reason
My cousin, ?Aje?, yeah you locked down
But you ain’t there, keep goin’!
To all the soldiers, warriors, runnin’ this race and do it to the end
Realize everyone, that you in the Father’s Heart, check it out

[Verse One]
First it was Mel, in the club, hit with a shell
Now his moms and pops is like, "Lord, where did we fail?"
Tony, Romano, and Shawn ballin’ too fast
They hit a curve, car done crash
Now they moms is on the streets, takin’ a blast
Because they passed away, certain things will happen
in your life to make you pray.
Live better for your seed, so they can breath today
You ain’t perfect, get it right, and it’s okay
We was born messed up, no lie, confess up
He knows your situation’s a struggle but, guess what?
You ain’t gotta be like that, so rest up
He sent His Son to shed the blood, live, that’s what
After the foundation, we was apart
One man didn’t do right from start
Unseen forces throwin’ darts, got your head
spinnin’ like a go-cart, but don’t give up, why?
‘Cause you on the Father’s heart

[Chorus - singer 4X w/ ad-libs]
Don’t give up, ‘cause you are, on the Father’s he-a-art

[Verse Two]
Things ain’t the same no mo’, parents they don’t
cry out to the Lord, they don’t get on they knees and hit the flo’
That’s why we havin’ abortions, they on the streets
paying for extortions, livin’ a lie, dyin’ for the fortune
The Father’s heart remorsin’ for the dead, but there’s hope
for the li-vin’ release the Son in the earth
For the given for the death in the grave, He paved the way
No longer living as slaves, that’s why we watch and pray (Thank God I am freeeeee)
In these end times, I hope these rhymes they bless your mind
Get that peace, so you can live fine
We ain’t promised tomorrow, receive the one livin’ in horror
Before it gets better, it has to be, plenty of sorrow (plenty of sor-row)
Let’s come together, instead of being apart
Let’s shine some light, in the midst of the dark
And the words that I say, if you hear ‘em clearly
They comin’ from, the Fathers heart, please feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
God bless all people in nations, ‘cause we was all made
in His creation, but we faced with deadly situations
That’s killing this world’s population, it’s an unseen war
Babies being torn, don’t know what they here for
But my Father’s gonna settle the score, and that’s the truth
Not just facts, I promise you He said that
Got you covered like plaque, hold on, be strong
Ain’t no turning back, time is moving quicker sayin’
"Put the crack down, my young dealers
Confused thoughts tryna to trick ya
Stay focused, ‘cause the end is near-a"
Hear it clear like a dog’s loud bark
Separating the fishes, from the sharks
Revealin’ secrets like an unseen NARC
I know you hear me, feel me
And yeah, it’s comin’ from, the Father’s heart..

[Chorus]

(Mega feed through the mind like..
... yeah, yo.)

Splash thoughts on a page
cigarettes be like, batteries when I need to write
All play nice, ‘til the sun comes up
tryin’ to come up with flows over drums
while we love blowin’ drowse
Hard to get by, with a pocket full of chromes
in a facade, where everybody try the cane
and need to, no jokin’
Now, ironies of life, got me tryin’ to quit smokin’
While I’m smokin’, goin’ through the motions
stay floatin’, keep the head above waters
All types of emotions
Knowin’ the best ain’t, is to maintain
streets is framed, spoke tryin’ to peep our game:
How we played
puttin’ down bets, down the begs
Surrounded by effects
feelin’ like; soon everything’s gonna be all right
Better tomorrows
No time for sorrow
Keep it up
Got to stay up..
... I’ll pray for us..

[You know what we can do and what we can’t do?
What we can say and what we can’t say?
I don’t know that anymore..
... So I’m in a position that
the only thing that I can say about that is: Fuck it!]

... Stay focused
even when things seem hopeless
Time movin’ so quick
Fall back, and see it all in slow-motion
head all over the place; what a mess
Give my best through the complication
event new ideas and innovate keys
Our future \xc2\x96 generations
dependin’ on a stremph of role models
sons that grew up without fathers
All wasn’t bard, but, still tryin’ to bill harder
Put in work, life is worth
more than the problems we let bather us
through petty arguments
Parents startle, of their young ones
goin’ out in the dark, better give them truth
before they find out for themselves
and can’t get through it
But we learn, mad of how we was raised
in the race, from a little to a lot
Out of the game, makin’ no matter
what those that didn’t understand had to say..

[I don’t think they really understand what they’re doing
I think they’re so hung up on maintaining their positions
that the only way that people could deal with this..
... Is to take it in the streets.]

... ‘Cuz we, been through the struggle
now we tryin’ to come through
talkin’ about life, and moms \xc2\x96 how I love you
Past days full of stress, cigarettes and licks
piss, but I can’t get sick
Gotta stay up, pray for us
see ‘em brighter days
smiles on our face
Sometimes I want to get away
stay and lookin’ up at the heavens
devine minds, devisualise the seven
Within concealed sins
came from the bottom of the bin; puttin’ in bed
And everybody got mad jokes
growth, gang with hopes
at the end of our ropes
cats laugh with their folks
Never let problems fade you
know, everything true, everyday true

[ VERSE 1: MC Twist ]
Check it out
I’m hip-hop’s EF Hutton cause all the people listen
Flash is steady cuttin while I’m straight dissin
You see, it all starts when I step on stage
And pull a freak out the crowd that will engage
In a freak show on the dance floor
I don’t claim to be hardcore
But the way I write is the way I feel
Not a styler but I’m makin that dollar bill
I love to rant and rave cause that’s the way I behave
While freaks throw kisses, throw panties and wave
Intimidatin by the words I speak
And it’s on the strength so it can’t be weak
It’s strong, never long, my words are brief
And the crowd’s a tribe and I’m the head chief
Forever dictated by the way I rhyme
So all you suckers (better luck next time)

Yo Flash, it’s on the strength, boy, so cut it up
(Hit it)

[ VERSE 2: MC Twist ]
It’s kinda like Monopoly, I’m the wealthiest player
Cold crushin filthy rhyme sayer
With all the moves to keep me in the game
Makin record after record, buildin up my fame
With the mic that I like I can’t do no harm
Doesn’t kill or do damage like a firearm
It’s just a tool that I use to school
Just like a queue stick when I’m shootin pool
You talk a lotta trash you will get floored
Like a piece get jumped on a checkerboard
Meet your inner dark alley, I make you fall
Like you’re a pin and I’m a bowling ball
So enemies freeze, I don’t intend to budge
Never goes away talkin ‘bout my grudge
So to those who fall victim to my rhyme
All I gotta say (better luck next time)

Yo Flash, we still rockin em, so do it again
(Hit it)

[ VERSE 3: MC Twist ]
You know I max hard in Cali checkin out the East
Where the West Coast sounds are heard the least
Promotin my single, no need to hope
Cause I know it’s gonna hit and the beat is dope
I’m gettin stronger the longer I spit these rhymes
I’m makin hella more cents [/sense] than nickels and dimes
Words bein joined without weak points
Hookin up to one another like skeleton joints
If a line gets heard after bein bit
I’m in the fast like I’m usin a first aid kit
Then I find the sucker who did me wrong
Take him out quick and repossess the song
Cause my name is Twist and that’s the name it’s done
So all jokes aside, eliminate the fun
Read my lips correct when I end this rhyme
Cause all I gotta say (better luck next time)

[Verse 1]
My future’s finally clear, even with my eyes shut
I won’t question high ideas, they go and chose us
So realize and use us, the words of the mistress
The words that was written all as a statistics
Seen the better side of life, I experience the worst
God must have saved something for me for what is worth
Ex cocaine, hell run eighty just up in eighty
No matter what state I was in I was up in edit
Might know your brain, was in my teens when I started tootling
The money ain’t a thing, came in and start shooting
Got this track on my arm and maybe you can feel me
Made me honest with that, addiction tried to kill me
No affection in my brain, information in my heart
How could I be so bright, the future looked so dark
When hospitalized for my deeds I was moving in high speed
Seeing shit dope through high Vs
I know I come a long way for me to talk about it
You been through what I been through? But I doubt it
Ah, it don’t mean that I’m better than you
I just read the prescription of the man, it all work through

[Chorus]
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again

[Verse 2]
There be time interpretation of my life
Says that I’ve seen the Passion of Christ with millions
And record sales to the consumer drug sales
To seeing loved ones die while in jail
Know how it feels to have a child that you barely hail
And how it feel when left on betray
Now I know how it feel to probail
Now I know hot it feel when God take you high, set a movie scale
I’ve been on a journey but I realized life’s
just a long sometime to see the heart to meet
I put you alone
I’m feeling thug into the microphone
Taking hardship using God’s gifts
Inspite a nigga that turns
Got his YNT vision that gotta be fulfilled
Like the 22 years got on to turn on the bill
So miss me with the fake shit, cause I can’t take it
I’m thanking God for my experience for living reckless

[Chorus]
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again

[Intro: talking]
It seems to me, that all this talking and stuff is getting us nowhere.
It’s time for some action, you know what I mean.  Positive reaction,
verbal action.  I got to start frying these fools, man.

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo
If every action has it’s opposite reaction
I want to see the opposite of wack MCs rapping
On some 58(?) recordless mics
They ain’t even holding right
Hold on, let me light this dynamite (kablow)
Now they out of sight like space probes
I’m on some futuristic shit
They on some rerun episodes
We can take this to the crossroads and do it until we’re done
Presto! and make that shit vanish like a sun
During an eclipse or at nightime when I write rhymes
With precise lines and a few hooks like fish lines
You little groupers want to swim with barracudas
After you’re done faling off, there’ll be more room for me to maneuver
Out of these Montreal sewers to doing tours
Worldwide.  A lot of MCs never seen the other side
It seems like that shit’s off limits like area 51
As I breach them perimiters with a verbal ????

[CHORUS]
No holds barred, full contact
And it’s a fact that you act lax
I make my people react when I be speaking over tracks
Yo, it’s a shame that you have to get the axe
No holds barred, full contact
And it’s a fact that you act lax
I make my people react when I be speaking over tracks
Yo, it’s a shame that you have to get the axe

[Verse 2]
Fools need to stop, sit back, relax and face the facts
‘Cause they ain’t ready to do nothing with their skinny raps
My techs leaves theirs with an inferority complex
Then I deliver quicker than the snap suplex
It’s useless, for you to put up a struggle
Consume your planet like bad actors or reduce it to rubble
My vision’s like Hubble so I can see the big picture
Everytime I hear these suckers rap, they getting me sicker
‘Cause that stuff is only fit for the shitter
They better off going back to passing out flyers and stickers
Licking spliffs with the family
Verbal shots at the enemy
Bunch of fools rapping now because they think it’s trendy
They try to rapture the structure of the culture
Better start cutting through these punks like hot knife through butter
It’s a like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How many more of these fake MCs I have to take under

[CHORUS]

[Talking]
Now I think it’s time to knock these frauds right out of position.  They
occupying space.  That’s our space.
[Verse 3]
You make the next ‘scape to the netscape, aye
I’mma search for you with Excite
And then wipe out your website
Your weak rap ballards are getting tossed like salad
‘Cause they invalid, to the one who strikes like steal mallards
Ain’t having disrespect from other camps
Trying to stop my advance, but I stay firm like the horse stance
Your eyes are open, but you’re still sleeping on duty
Those rhymes are dookie and were put together loosely
Load up, the vocal blaster ‘cause I have to
Turn half ass rappers into out of work actors
‘Cause they taking up too much space and precious air time
I gotta keep pusing them back like hairlines
Back of the line, ‘cause you ain’t yet paid your dues
And even though your sponser just gave you a new pair of shoes
That don’t mean that you can rap
Matter of fact what you’re doing is wack
And I’m about to fad this shit to black

[CHORUS]

‘Contact’ (scratched)... ‘React, you missing that when I sling this rap’
‘Contact’ (scratched)... ‘React, you missing that when I sling this rap’

[Intro/Interlude]
I’m, ready, to, roll
I’m I’m, ready, to, roll
I’m, ready, to, roll
I’m I’m, ready, to

[Verse 1]
Step into the galaxy, ice ages they’re passin me
Now the world is ours lookin at the beach from a balcony
And the word is bonded with solid gold from the alchemy
What he imagines becomes reality
Spent a lifetime with a masterpiece, kill ‘em all savagely
Rappers ain’t the truth talkin fallacy
Put it next to ‘em if they spit now they swallowing battery acid
Ask who got the juice now candidly
Maybe it’s a fantasy to lead in the following
The king of the dynasty, a queen in a hive of bees
Investin in the future, startin up a family
Makin it the new shit I’ll even give you time to think, follow me
The swag ain’t televised still I’m hoe channelling
Flyer than a comet, don’t kill yourself, it’s the Prada week
If the sky’s the limit we got a endless supply of dreams
We could kick it first we gotta leave - obviously

[Chorus]
Wheels are turnin, the engine is workin, I’m ready to roll
I got my bag and my chick, lookin bad in the whip, I’m ready to roll
You know the sky is the road, when I’m in control, I’m ready to roll
I got a spliff for the ride, I be feelin the vibes, I’m ready to roll

[Yak Ballz]
You ready to roll huh? This here space is off-limits
Unless you bought a muh’fuckin ticket
In attempt to take the plunge maybe like Scrooge McDuck
Fixated on the plastic girls, fake world that drown in the
sea of skulls when you thought it was auspicious
The wrong thinkin that get you shark tankin with the fishes
Waterfallin this liquor down my throat
But tomorrow I’ll be begging for forgiveness from the Pope
The new breed is more vicious, the teeth like spokes
Flippin styles like baseball cards between those
And I don’t think the jury is authentic
Much as they insecure, trippin on some stepped on blow
Sup~?! You can’t stand the heat then get the fuck up out the kitchen
That would be the gasoline I used to fire up the engine
High as the religion be in love was sort of sacrilegious
Smack her ass, this time it’s for the distance, she ready to go

[Interlude] - 1.5X

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You ready to roll?
Yeah
That Yak Ballz shit, uh-huh
Gas Galaxy, yup
I’m ready to go

[ VERSE 1 ]
This is dedicated to my favorite, dead or livin
From rappers to the master turntable technicians
We haunted, all of us, lost in inner vision
Brittle condition, some of the best are stuck in prison
Most of us don’t know what else to do except the business
We only went to school special days they took the pictures
Police-ophobic, I suffer lack of patience
I’m sort of crazy, but can’t afford no medication
I face a high percentage my success will never be
Cause if I threw a rock I’d hit a rapper, guaranteed
Thieves never love the sunny days above the seas
The minute that you make it ( ? ) leave

[ CHORUS ]
That’s what sucks about
That’s what sucks about
That’s what sucks about rap music
I love what sucks about
I love what sucks about
I love what sucks about
Doin it and doin it

[ VERSE 2 ]
Stoppin for some donuts 80 miles outside of Dallas
On a tourbus, everybody thinks I’m Lenny Kravitz
We laughin up in Denny’s, causin traffic signin napkins
And hats with ‘Lenny K’ - with a peace sign after it
It just so happens I haven’t showered in like 48 hours
I’m rollin wrappers, someone booked this tour backwards
Tonight we in New York, then circle to Atlanta
Then up to Philly, and then some joint in Alabama
Dressing room smellin like a fresh can of anus
There’s a fly in my potatos and the soundman is ancient
Talkin ‘bout a show in ‘88 with Rick James?
He loves reggae music, it’s "irie" we came?
In the middle of the set my speaker get to mufflin
My DJ soundin like some alley cats fuckin
Over feedback, believe that, it always happens with us
And the worst four letter word I’ve ever heard is show business

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Put out a couple records, do some shows, make impressions
And you’re just another name on the grapewine naked
People like, "I know him" - You don’t know me
"Aiyo Zeem, ‘member me from them Woodworth Street days, gee?"
They keep you restin and they play you all accessible
Frontin on your schedule, actin all professional
They be like, "Gimme your number and ah, well, we’ll do this"
Meanwhile you can’t remember who the hell is Do-This
Talkin ‘bout a blunt and we should take it to the cuts
Shit, y’all ain’t stickin me up
I don’t want that
That’s how a brother end up sleepin where the swamps at
I’ll be at the party dancin naughty with some wombat

[ CHORUS 2x ]

[Half-A-Mill]
Word on the street the fiends love us
Shit could see us on magazine covers
That’s that kid wit the green Hummer, checked out
Pants saggin nearly got my dick out
Sippin his style I got it locked here
Son choosed a different route
Them faked mob appeared here we ship ‘em out
Pistol whip you too crippled
Take your whip and your bitch too official
Infrared light through a crystal
Shoot your head off, your ice sizzles
Your life sizzles, recognize the signal
Wit my thugs that out to get you
4-5’s and 9 spit through
Anythin that gotta get thru to hit you
Chill everybody wit you
I catch bodies like its ritual
Be reticle if I don’t get rid of you, principle
Fuck politickin I ain’t political, invincible
Communistic, kinda criminal, show vonistic, I fire at women too
I make hoes tot biscuit and blow the whole crew
I rock Gucci and Louie Vuitton suits, denim
You see me on HBO, gettin interviewed in the coupe
We came a long way from the projects shootin off the roof
Lost shoes, we the bottles forbes, we livin proof

[Sleep Eyes]
It ain’t a part time solution for a lifetime disease
Early mornin heat blow towards night time the breeze
See ballers fiend for night shine and V’s
While cats like me fiend for G’s
Stressin like dimes and trees
And forward blind seeds
Illuminati scams too advance to chance
To get what Giuliani plans
The lord blew breath through us
Then threw dirt next to us
That’s why we thug it to death through us

[Chorus: Ali Vegas] **repeat 2X**
In this world of Warriors, niggaz wanna be Glorious
Money and power got me brainwashed to be Notorious
The streets of New York where there’s more takin then givin
The Borough I live its more like inner city prison

[Ali Vegas]
They got me on the run hard
From a gun charge cuz of young rod
The young God killed his young broad and unyard
Now they got me locked in the cell
Only 500 G’s could get me out of this hell
Readin cop shots I just got in the mail
Yo I ain’t hit the block in a week
Ever since I got knocked in the sweep
Call home and see what’s poppin wit Sleep (Wuttup)
He told me Milliato coped ‘em a Jeep (Word?)
I hoped that bitch liked don’t rock ‘em to sleep (Stay up)
I miss bein home wit Sammy’s and Shanks
Milliato throw the dice down and give me the bank
We like Claude, Jimmy and Frank, Henny and Dank
It’s ill how we grew from pennies to Franks
And we gonna endure til the thrown is renowned
Ayo Mill don’t even worry ‘bout me, Cat n Will holdin me down

[Chorus: Ali Vegas] **repeat 2X**

[Half-A-Mill]
Dunn we fly wit Ki’s, stash cash like the Chinese
Me and my crimey’s we was born grimey
Now my son whipped the Bentley behind me
Takin pictures of the feds, takin pictures of me
Ill eye piece, watch me, watch me, they can’t stop me
Used to cop grams, now I sell candies to Papi
Tryin to cop a space ship and leave this planet behind me
And build a thug universe around Plan and try me
Until then I’mma handle the Tommy
Keep them chicks in the strip club gettin butt scrabble it mami
Ya’ll fake playas need not try me
Blast you out your mink in gators
Claim you can’t and beat like Rodney

[Chorus: Ali Vegas] **repeat 2X**

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I’m Reason
I’m Recluse
He’s Phantom
We’re coming

Background vocals: 
She grew up too fast
Now she’s a star

[Verse 1: Reason]
Her American Express card says Gothika
Wears some black lipstick on certain occasions
Take first place in a pageant like Jean Benet
Be found in the basement dead the next day
Choke her best friend with a Jawbreaker perhaps
A valedictorian shot gunning the Pabst
Take muscle relaxers so she can relax
Be a prom queen with a set of veins black

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Recluse]
I can’t imagine a better place for Debbie
Sleeping at her wake so peacefully
Act twice her age relate with sex and amphetamines
Live the glamour life be treated like a beauty queen
Consume the world all at once just like she always dreamed
See the pyramids, experience ecstasy
Become a piece of meat inferior to Hennessey
Sell her body for money whenever hungry and cold
Take it all back to fifteen before she lost control

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Reason]
Little Miss Muffet
Get some implants cause natural won’t cut it
Change her name to Wonderwoman, companion to me
Continue the drugs, mix the coke with the speed
Sleep with the teacher if it helps her get an A
Sleep with the preacher after confession forgave
Move to Hollywood the day after her graduation
Never be a virgin again out of frustration

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Recluse]
She wants a house on the hill with a spectacular view
An ounce of some pills and a bunny tattoo
Appeal to the masses, a Hollywood actress
A face made of plastic and voluptuous assets
Flirt with disease I’m concerned with HIV
Keep health and hygiene a secret from you and me
See her name and life behind a scene of fiends
She wants to be famous overnight but this her eulogy

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Reason]
Raggedy Ann
Give a disease to everybody that’s her plan
Make up some stories to start gossip
Make up her face with the best makeup
Be the only women who really lived her life
Be the spokesperson for teenage suicide

[Recluse]
Beat herself up a bloody mess of molecules
Deal with the stress resolve the rest with sharp tools
Escape this place of all the misery and sorrow
Confront death, abandon the world and see tomorrow
Blame the world before she leaves to save face
Unaware that the life between the wait suffers the same face

[Chorus]

[Verse One: E-Rock]
Pussy, Pussy--Pussy, Pussy
Weed and alcohol it seems to satisfy us all, indeed
Don’t even trip, half of you bitches like pussy too
Love to smoke weed and get high, sip,serve
And let the freaky shit up out
And suck the skin off a nigga dick
I’s a playa, I’s a never had to trick
Stupid fuck put the game down so well
Can have yo bitch playing a good game of suck dick and tell
Nigga don’t trip

I’m pickin’ up a shot of cock, some head, and it’s all good
It just might be yo baby momma or sister
But then again, 
If it is, you better be tryin’ to be a nigga friend
Cuz see I do this shit only one way, nigga the "G" way
Blowin’ my hair back, gettin’ my dick sucked on the freeway
I never lie on my dick cuz that’s a playa rule
Smokin’ weed, gettin’ drunk
Rockin’ shows and then be ready to fuck somethin’

[Chorus]

Pussy,Pussy--Pussy, Pussy
[pussy weed and alcohol]
Pussy,Pussy--Pussy, Pussy
Pussy,Pussy--Pussy, Pussy

Pussy,Pussy--Pussy, Pussy
[that’s how we playa’s ball]

[Verse Two: 007, Lo-Life]
I guess these hoes didn’t hear me, when I said bitch please 
Now it’s five years later big faces, big sprees
Talkin’ bout bad bitches up in condos
Smokin’ mad swishers, bout to get some head pronto
Pussy, weed, and alcohol nigga,
Plus that cash go with it
Double "o" we clockin’ hoochies
Stick a bird up in her pussy
Smokin’ cryptonite, rollin’ in a benz
Souppin’ up some tenz
Bout to break ‘em for they endz
Tell ‘em Lo man

I’m in a ninty eight, put it out
Gased up to the fullest, b--e-n-z
Two bitches and me
A quarter pounder, weed, and hennessy
They lookin’ sexy
From the start they under me
Too tough, I got they hearts pleased
Understand indeed
Ways to get yo ass, through the days
With razor blades
Tight game you’ll fade ‘em all away
Peeped the laid out
Pussy, weed, and "D" [fellas]
Alcohol and "G" [fellas]
Bitches come in fleets [fellas]
Courtsey on me [fellas]

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Will got him two bad mutherfuckas comin’ from out of town

Let me fall for you, you could fall for me

[Verse One]
From these times now and back down to Biblical days
Counterfeit Jesus’ have raised in the ages
Searched the pages of the Biblion the Holy Bible not the holy quran
No, Jesus warns us what would come after
Matthew the 24th chapter
"For many will come in my name sayin’ ‘I am the Christ’"
But they’re really actors
Woe unto those who chose and teaches
A non-Biblical Jehovah Jesus
Woe, they might use the name but read in anotha’ meanin’
We must put a stop to the doctrine of demons
I must run this it might get hostile
We don’t want the Christ of Oneness Pentecostals
We want the incarnate Christ of the apostles
The pre-existent Son, the One of the gospel

[Hook]
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan homie
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan whoodi
Represent the authentic and real Jesus
We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan son
Represented through Christians is the real Jesus
We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan dirty
Represent the authentic and real Jesus

[Verse Two]
You’re bound to drown in a broken ship
If your hope is in the Jesus of Joseph Smith
Woe, that doctrine will have your life stormin’
Come to the knowledge of Christ not to the one of the Mormons
Jesus is not Lucifer’s spiritual brother
And the heavenly Father did not have sex with his mother
Mary, scary I seen them two dudes in my hood
Tellin’ me God was a man at first and progressed to His Godhood
No, eternal is the Godhead
The Father has always been God that’s what the 90th Psalm says
Keep your eyes on Jehovah’s witness
Who mistranslates 1:1 of John in the Holy Scriptures
They say more to get your mind tangled
They deny Jesus is God but the incarnate Michael the archangel
If no angel was called the Son in Hebrews 1
Then why is Jesus called the Son

1-Come on, ride the train, hey, ride it, woo woo

Graduated from Boone up to Alize
Baby, you looking tough to death
Got your weave done right, it’s on so tight

Right about now it’s about that time for me to holler
Girl, I wanna waller in the back of my impala

To this world of aqua (to this world of aqua)
To this world of aqua

Hey yo, at night I can’t sleep
I toss and turn
Writin’ rhymes in the dark so that somebody gets burned
In a fire that my pen sparks, I blend art
Mixed with my insomnia
Creatin’ poison ?in the lyrics????
So I’m goin’ out to be bombin’ ya
With an extra dosage, the coast that I’m approachin’
The more your overdosin’
Your heart rushes straight to a convulsion
And the rest of my agents cardiac, while I’m like,"Where’s the party at?

"Where the bottle and party hat?"
Let’s start our own Mardi Gras
As long as a got a mic, bottle and broad, it’s gonna be on
It ain’t over ‘til I’m sober, and even then
I’ll party wit’ a hangover
I ran over your file, studied your craft
Which forced me to laugh at your style
You need to forfeit for a while
Purchase a one way ticket to the middle of nowhere
Don’t even go there
‘Cuz you won’t stay there

Chorus(x2):
Don’t try to follow what you can’t swallow
I’m sort of what you might call a mic ?tallow?
Just gettin’ phenomenal from the abdominal
Breathin’ the words of a scientist, applyin’ this
1st ending: Yeah, yeah, applyin’ this
2nd ending: What, what, applyin’ this

Be like the last notations of Christ
The mic is my fascination of life
You rappers evaporate in the light
I do shit like stab you in the face wit’ a knife
Sheiked out in titanium pipes
That’ll leave you deserted like Arabian Nights
At night, I’m achin’ to write shit to disable your hearing and sight
You’re fearin’ the fight, where we can site
This right, these niggaz is like
"Wait, I’m heavy and might brake your oral with the horror that I
strike."
On page and on stage
My name should not be forgotten
I hit the spot in your brain and let it decay
Until it’s rotten, ya niggaz don’t got it
Knowin’ the flow is hypnotic and has your mental enter dimensions
While we damage the rest of your senses
House of rest, we won’t rest until we collect checks from my pension
And even then we’ll leave ya niggaz a suspection from the worst that we
mention
Puttin’ these kids back to detention

Chorus(x2)

Now once again it’s the mictalogist
Some say you need a psyche analysis
But even the most psychotic psychiatrist won’t take my assignment
The say my mind is a virus
Spreadin’ germs through the environment
MC’s take an early retirement from these ones that are firin’
Throughout the mouthpiece, battle me?
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Rhymes navigates through your body, detonates like a shotty
Exits out your anal cavity because of gravity
You see, these rhymes they rub your insides, without a doubt
And the only way to operate is to turn your body inside out
Mission impossible, too many obstacles, stick to what’s possible
I’ll even deliver the news to your fam
Straight from the hospital, man, it isn’t logical, it’s just unstoppable

We know to go for what’s profitable
Leave him alone, he’s not gonna pull...through
Why?  ‘Cuz I left his body corrupted with black and blues
That’s forever part of his life like tattoos
Even if you try to erase it still can be traced
We’re live at the barbecue puttin’ the grill to your face
And no matter the year, my niggaz still in the place

"Follow, follow."
"They do not know my sorcery."
"Where are you leading us?"
"Rest assured, a short distance more."
"C’mon let’s go."
"By all the power I possess, I (Jedi) shall that they are never heard
from again"

Yeah, Jedi, Son of Spock
For ‘98
Yeshua Da PoED, on the track
Follow us
C’mon
C’mon let’s go

Verse 1:

The buck stops here
Collecting emcees in the front of my truck my bad reindeers
Call ya misses and tell her xale is going to make it rain dear
Made my pain clear
But don’t play this game with tears
Save the stage for years
Paint the page with mirrors
So I can reflect on what I write
Do I detect jealousy? C’mon-guys
Your head is green and girls are saying let-us
Put some lead in your pencils
In a thong ya hot but I wanna make you choke on my pole
It’s a long way to the crop if wanna smoke on the dole
This is the start of a new book
Try and get in my ring I won’t chew but you’ll get the hook
I wanna chicken head but don’t fetch me a chook 

Verse 2:

Back to the drawing board is what went through my mind
Crack my pen cos drawing got me board so I fastfoward time
That glass jaw isn’t mine
Im damaging this beat
I’ve lost faith in U.K rap who’s managing the streets?
Call me a show pony
Hoe blow me
Foes know me
The Simpsons are done I’m at moes lonely
Started off listing to the off-spring
See you guys next summer cos I’ve gone off spring
Walkmans to disk mans to iPods
We’re now gawking at a vision that leaves us robbed
Fuck it tease a cop
You don’t like my raps give me a reason to stop
Fall into my traps cos it’s hunting season release with a dot

Verse 3:

This is the wind up verse
Cos I wind you up so much it hurts
Look on a serious note 
I played the game of delirious quotes
It got me nowhere in a hurry
At first I didn’t care for the money
Riddle can’t fuck a milf but you have to sleep with a mummy
Now people fear what they don’t understand
I’ll make this clear I’m gonna free slaves of pop music call me Abraham 
This will be banned
I even if I won an Oscar it would be canned
It’s funny in real life the people least like puppets are the homeless man
Ha ha ha bring it
At the bar bar bar drink it
In ya car car car sing it
Dah Dah Dah sheen it!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
(You better be easy) You gotta take your time to get what you want from me shorty
(Baby be easy) I’m a need a little more if your tryin to run your game on me
(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I’m all messed up shorty
(You better be easy) It’s gonna take all you got oh baby
(Take your time and fall back easy)

[Verse 1: Hot Rod]
Nigga lean to the back be easy jack
Get cheese off of tracks twenty three’s on Lac

Roll up that window, gimme that indo

Ask hoes sometime I’m a man that’s gentle
Two hoes shit that’s a menagetrois
Got that tongue on mt thing they goin la la la

So get yo’ ass to the rear matter of fact

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
(You better be easy) You gotta take your time to get what you want from me shorty

(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I’m all messed up shorty

[Verse 2: Hot Rod]
Now I changed this hoe she was actin all bouji

Little time passed she was givin the booty
First time I met her she was callin me mooley
Chill with me mama I’m a get the nana

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]

(Oooh baby be easy) You better take what you could get cause right now I’m all messed up shorty
(You better be easy) It’s gonna take all you got oh baby
(Take your time and fall back easy)

(v1)
pack the bags
it’s time to leave before I find myself a purpose
run the hands across the life, sometimes it’s just a circus
I hope she still loves me, when my eyes finally close
a vacant heart to spread disease still gone from head to toe
I’m a caustic little man, wasting caustic little kisses
hold a cough inside my hand, give all to best of wishes
her smiles are so delicious, but she needs time to breath
the flames burnt out
she said she’s seen enough of me, a fate worst then death
I want my chest to stop beating
I wish the world still loved me, and I never hurt from grieving
lay down, eyes up, let her voice fill the ceiling
remember all the times she cried, and all the smiles that she’d give me
I feel like a failed kidney
in a world with no donors, eat my words, by and by
I’m the void between my shoulders, the heads getting colder
violent tears in my eyes
a set of love, lost and locked, I am just a parasite

(v2)
I use to want to die, until my brother beat me to it
now my stomach just cries, no more acting foolish
keep the fame under wraps, fuck love, no give backs
hide the name from the eyes, so far from impact
hold the head little man, keep the track spic and span
hold the tongue ever slightly treat your life as quicksand
trade your words, and pay your dues, stay down like tennis shoes
this depression never wins, it’s to late, it mustn’t lose

(v3)
now I’m back on top, sit tight, I can’t stand me
sell the struggle, till I die, act normal in front of family
in a world of cotton candy, I am laced in moth balls
cross the "T’s" and dot the "I’s" lose legs and start to crawl
bounce hard like pinballs, living like a circumcision
drowning ink across the page, give pace some competition, only ask for recognition
I can barely go to sleep, between love and losing Sid
I am just to fucking weak, I am hung when I speak
try to dig myself some holes, please Lindsay still need me
I was just an asshole, walking home in the snow
I watch the breath start to freeze
see the leaves shed there limbs, night covers up the trees
shiver tight inside of sleeves, shake the hands inside of gloves
close my eyes and start to speak, give my family all my love

[Daddy Free]
I was taught, never put trust in a young man
cause if you let him live then he’ll try to take a stand
take command of the whole show
but no it’s not so, so I put him on deathrow
I crucify my flesh daily
cause if I don’t then my flesh’ll try to slay me
a try to slay me kill the wrong guy
wack ships so mud, objection is murder (?)
on the third degree, and thats the word for me
I pull the plug on his cardiac emergency
you might think it’s ill G
but if I don’t kill my flesh then my flesh’ll try to kill me
so I just kill and kill and kill and kill again
no mercy put my flesh in the herse it’s not my friend
so if you want to lock me up I’m guilty as I present this
It’s an everyday death sentence

[Gizmo]
murder one in the morning when I wake up shake up
I pray to break up any plan the devil will make up
I bails at the flesh cause see the noose is fixed
Christ is alive and my flesh is on a crucifix
but the flesh is like a Terminator, why?
I kill him once but he comes back like Arnold Schwartzeneggar
like when I thought he was back in the dust
he tried to stab me in the back with a knife full of lust
so I let 2 fly
First Corinthians 6:18’, Proverb 5 and 5’’
this time I’m makin sure I take him out
as he bails to the ground I grab my sword and gouge his eyes out
pull out his tongue with James 3 verse 1’’’
every chapter every verse
back in the hearse it go
if it rise up to sin I’m gone do it again and again and again
cause it’s an everyday death sentence

everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence
everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence

[Daddy Free]
my spirit man is alive
and for my spirit to live flesh has to die
cause it’ll be a straight conflict
my spirit wants to do right, my flesh wants to trip out, and get out
the grave that I paved and buried him in
quick fast in a hurry to sin you see, my flesh is in the clique
he’s cornered on and hes tied up in sin devil wickedness
like lust, fornication that results in the jealousy
sorcery, idolatry, immorality
fighting, backbiting, being mean
like Galations 5:19’’’’
and it’s in, the wages of sin, equals death
so I really have no other choice left
I denied him, crucifed him, blind side him
tied him up and choked him up I snuffed him
plea for mercy, I continued to hit him
till I destroyed his deeds and everything that came with ‘em
the next day he tried to make me sin, but no win
cause I’m gone pray to kill him again
went on a fast, no juice no bread
gillotene to the head, ten seconds before he’s dead
dont trip up, I’m not a menace
this ain’t a one time thing it’s an everyday death sentence

[Gizmo]
in jail, for murder one homocide
you killed somebody no I killed my pride
cause thats when the flesh homies
you tried to make me feel like I’m the one and only like Sony
yeah years did the finest on my ego
yeah boy you’ve been dope since your fetal stages
why don’t you write pages and pages of dope rhymes
and bust lyrics like gauges, rock stages
he tried to make me arrogant like some of y’all
but it’s a set up, cause pride come before the fall
It’s a struggle, so Giz ain’t givin in
I’m dealing Monday and Tuesday but still he want to live again
cry from flesh so it want recognition
so I beat him down in humble submission
I grab pride by the neck I and slung him
before the Cross of Calvary I grabbed the rope and hung him
Christ is only lifted up, so I don’t resent this event, or repent
this is an everyday death sentence
oh God I got a life time bid
I confess I killed the flesh and oh yes I’m glad I did
now I’m D E A D, and it’s he who lives in me
and guilty is how I plea
and it’s a everyday death sentence

everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence
everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence

(Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash..yo.. frankie j.... obession)

Well it’s early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But it’s driving me so crazy
I dont know if it’s right
I’m tossin turning in my bed
It’s 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can’t sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I’m feeling hopeless in my home
I dont know what to do I think I’m in love
Baby...

[Chorus]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you’re not my lady
But I’m just tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do I’m going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it witchu well than maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite
Now I dont care if you got a man
Baby I wish you’d understand
Cuz I know he can’t love you right, quite like I can
It’s 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can’t sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak...
I’m feeling hopeless at home
I dont know what to do I think I’m in love

[Chorus]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
It’s an obsession

[Baby Bash]
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin less surene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream
You’re my blessin when I’m stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I’m gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my ma know how I do
We go rendez-vous
Mi corazon belongs to you

[Chorus]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this aint love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Amor

[Verse 1]
Start ? the things that make you think about yourself
Drop everything that’s been a hassle to your mental health
Watch carefully and then you’ll see I bear an empty shell 
Carelessly you’ll never see apparent calls for help
What you believe so fluently that things can never change
And you stupidly refuse to see the errors in your ways
And I understand that ? plan it’s thoroughly deranged
But that doesn’t mean that you should so scared to break away
Well I wonder what’s under the cover of darkness
Counting the number ?
Making an effort to realise all this suffering has to be making some progress
Treasure the way ? those places, hated the way that you showed me those faces
Breaking the balance of homeostasis, taking my talents and cover them basic
Oh face it, well it’s inevitable when it’s set in the stone when I’m sending my soul
Into the hell that I know that my rhetoric won’t be ?
I’m faceless, this error hasn’t made a name because it’s caseless
I’m sick of all these wasted cases and their makeshift habitats
I’ll  make sense out of rap and take this cataract and make your vision out of wack
It’s calling, I’m falling a little bit more every day ? running from reapers I wanna be whole
? places of dwelling 
Well I guess I know one thing about life, everybody said to me that death is suicide
And I’m just trying to figure out if what I do is right
So Eyedea, why don’t you grab the mic and shed a little light?

[Verse 2]
Well the summer bleeds a foreshadow of what’s to come and go, the ? blankets me
Braces me, something sweet that I can taste
You’re my mother, I’m your morphine, let’s go make a baby out of two guitars 
That heavy heart, I’ll seem happy when you’re looking smoking singing eating fucking
One size fits angel coma, you’re my favourite stranger
And I won’t hate you till I know you
Somewhere between the garden and the grave
I bypassed the machine, I wouldn’t have felt its effects anyway
Sentiment is the tramp that bored the special hollow
Cram it in my ? and leaves a whole lot less to swallow
Exercise your right to never buy what you can borrow
Carve my sorrys in the sky and hope the sun hides them tomorrow
Manufactured disaster, it seems I made my bed
No one sees the burn holes until the sleeper wakes up dead
Take my hands away, I’ll pull the moon down with my wrists
Making plans to fake safe is possible is dangerous

[Verse 3]
Writer’s block just might have stopped this song from being finished
Cause my mind was stopped from rhymes I’ve dropped from previous conditions
So I listen to the words again envision things I would have said
And crossed out many lines that didn’t rhyme and left them all for dead
I was trapped inside my head and I couldn’t get out my pen from my back pocket
Guess I lost it, so I wrote these words instead
If you would just shut up enough for me to get my point across
I’m sure this conflict could be solved without having substantial losses
And when I see the rain is coming overhead I stay and function 
Back inside my mind I try to find the ways to make assumptions
Taking something that’s been written, mixing it down with high precision
And making it sound all nice and vivid imagine it with my direction and vision
And eloquence, the decadence, the medicine, the precedence
The messages, the sentences, the evidence that I presented to win
The reason to fight, the ? on their dream
The secret to life, the reason to be, yeah that’s all that’s shown to me

[Verse 4]
Well every once in a blue moon I read your mind
Heaven ended too soon and stole my pride and left me blind
Exercise my morning shakes pretended I was born this way
Wearing my Academy Award-winning performance face
Snake shedding skin, it’s all in my head again
Life fetish led me to a dead end
I said when but no one was listening
Obviously cause they filled it to the brim and are spilling it all over me
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl in this hole with me 
I’d fall on my face just to make sure that you notice me
Your cold shoulder’s always so sobering
I’ll be understood as long as I don’t overthink
Walking on thin ice, talking in the form of song
Singing in the key of life, I’ll lose my voice before too long
Head came loose and they screwed it back together wrong
Fire behind my eyes, desire died all night long

[Intro] [Woman speaking]
Let’s all sing, Pop Goes The (Eagle)

Like to welcome y’all to class.

[Verse One] [Motive]
Ayo, pop goes the eagle, hot slugs will greet you
With enough heat to cook beef stew, we eat duke
And me and Celph, we still hungry too
And we both keep guns like the Army do
So it’s nothing to pay a visit to your block with lights off
Don’t stop, just spray where you livin’ like Lysol
We don’t hesitate when we goin’ to war
We’ll redecorate your crib with bullet holes in the wall
Look you cats started to speak out a little bit too much
Until we put that gat to your teeth like a toothbrush
And if the jam won’t spray I’ll still be okay
Cause your man puts spice with a knife like O.J.
95% of these rappers are so fake
Fuck tecs I’ll handle these insects with roach spray
So what you wanna do?
Run and get your peoples?
I cock back the top
Pop goes the eagle

[Chorus] [x2]
Pop pop goes the eagle the eagle [x3]
Pop goes the eagle cause the eagle goes pop

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Pop goes the eagle like Alka Seltzer and seagulls
Explosive when they bullets hit and delete skulls
The force of that hammer clap 
Will leave your neck floppin’ like a Santa hat
Barrel poppin’ like a camera flash
By the time I get to Arizona
My +Broken Language+ is like them guys Smoothe and Trigger from Saratoga
Meditatin’ in a lair of cobras
Disgusted by them two broads you with, for real they was a pair of ogres 
Demigodzilla, I’m the god damn Tall Man from Phantasm
Canon nuns with cannon guns
Sanford Son collecting junk in my front yard
Blammin’ thugs, infectin’ punks who try to front hard
No way that I’m square when I pop rounds
I gave a Desert E to Heather B when she put her Glocks Down
Matter fact, Motive get the gats
Then let’s unload these motherfuckin’ biscuits in they pussy ass muffin batch

[Chorus] [x2]
Pop pop goes the eagle the eagle [x3]
Pop goes the eagle cause the eagle goes pop

Baby you know
Baby you know how much I rate [x2]

Baby you know if our love never last
(Still you’re my number one love)
I know that we’ve been through a lot in the past
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if the moon don’t align with the stars
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if you move on like racing cars
(Still you’re my number one love)

(My Love)
Baby you done made it to the top of my charts [x3]
(My Love)
Baby you done made it

She my favourite single, my jingle
the one who keeps me going when it’s tough
And when I’m feeling below on a zero
She helps me get my feelings right up
In this hell, she’s an Angel that’s been sent through
On a mission to deliver to me love
And everything I’ve been through
Has been me and you
From the smooth to the bumpy and the rough
Ee yay..
Coz You already know say I love her
Coz everything I do is proper
Even though say your mum and dad keep on telling me not to bother
See you already know say I love her
Coz everything I do is proper
and I’m just tryna let you know
Baby we’ll be alright

Baby you know if our love never last
(Still you’re my number one love)
I know that we’ve been through a lot in the past
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if the moon don’t align with the stars
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if you move on like racing cars
(Still you’re my number one love)

(My Love)
Baby you done made it to the top of my charts
(My Love)
Baby you done made it

And we’ll be alright
One day I wanna marry you and make you my wife
You’re a hell of a smash baby
You’re my Top 5
We’ve been through many stages and we did it all live
Yeah we did it all live baby we go never sync
My Queen here by my side and I’ll be forever King
And I ain’t tryna lie or pull no strings
Don’t see no reason why we can’t do our own thing
Oh I know you wonder
Am I just a one-hit wonder
Girl I really want ya
Oh give me one cha...chance
Oh I know you wonder
Am I just a one-hit wonder
Girl I really want ya
Oh give me one chance to love you right

Baby you know if our love never last
(Still you’re my number one love)
I know that we’ve been through a lot in the past
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if the moon don’t align with the stars
(Still you’re my number one love)
Even if you move on like racing cars
(Still you’re my number one love)

If we never work out and you end up in another man’s arms
(Still you’re my number one love yeaaahh)
If Police come to take me and they put me in a caravan star
(Still you’re my number one love yeaaahh)
If this cold world betray me and I lose my baby with no answer
(Still you’re my number one love yeaaahh)
If you’re no longer here and for reason that I fear, I go cherish every year
(Still you’re my number one love yeaaahh)

It’s Fuse, AY
(Still you’re my number one love yeaaahh)
It’s Off Da Ground
Killbeatz let’s go

Dirty and low with the same pair of pants on
Tables I dance on and benches at bed time
Way passed the deadline and waiting for the world’s end
I just had a terrible argument with my girlfriend
Something or other, I always seem to be in trouble
Getting kind of hard to hear and maybe now I’m seeing double
God almighty, give me strength and put the poison down tomorrow
Tonight I’m gonna stay up late, see if I can drown in sorrow

I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose
I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose

I’m lower than life, living like it’s the last day
Eyes gone out and hard like an ashtray
Dog won’t play with me, I’m smelly and unshaven
Walking in circles and searching for a safe haven
Time’s running low but sitll I remain patient
Practicing my lines hanging out at the train station
Five hundred excuses and working on a dozen more
Unemployed again, your parents hate me cause I’m poor

I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose
I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose

I’m quick to throw the towel and too stubborn to apologize
The future is bleak, and my memories are wallet-sized
I’m out of ideas, it feels like I’m choking
All of my mirrors and promises are broken
I’m lousy and threadbare, too low to get down
Almost out of gas but can’t stand to sit down
God almighty, wish me luck, let me go to sleep
I’m trying to keep it all together, I’ve got a lot to keep from crying

I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose
I go under the blouse and grope for the breast
I call this one hope and hope for the rest
I play fight rarely and barely touch the surface
Anchors away, I’m out of focus on purpose

Make a joyful noise unto the lord, all ye lame
Serve the lord with gladness
Come before his presence with singin
Know, ye that the lord is one
It is he that has made us, not we ourselves
We are his people *Bells begin to ring; wind blows*
In the sheep of his pasture
Enter, enter, enter, enter
Enter, enter, enter, enter
Enter *Music starts*

Verse 1:

Forgive me God, for I have forsaken thee
I’m not gonna say that it’s the devil that’s makin me
Do what I do, the things that I’ve done
Just because I’m young, and it’s all for fun
I never really thought about the consequences
But ever since Eazy died, I said "Now Ima listen"
Yay, though I walk through the valleys of death
I open my eyes, they droppin like flies, my last breath
Might get snatched, taken, broke down I’m shaken
Shaken by that shit that’s breakin
Down your nervous system
So, if you’re nervous listen
Kissin cousins die by the dozens
Because I like good lovin will I burn in a oven
Fiery furnace
Cause sometimes the yearn gets
Tempting so I yield into temptation
Intoxication mixed with fornication
Face the nation, face the revelation the ending
Will I be caught up in the rapture 
Or will I be left behind because what I’m caught up in got me captured
Amazin Grace, could save a wretch like me
But a wretch like me feels that Hell is already my destiny (Why?)
Because I messed with He (Who?),him
He who sends them
The demons
I see em schemin amongst my dreamin
They tell me he awaits suddenly I awake
I got a funny feelin it wont be long before He
takes my soul that was the deal all for mass appeal
Dollar dollar bill, now my fate seems sealed
The nails in the coffin, he’s coughin, I’m lookin
Through my iris
To see if he’s got the virus
Paranoia starts to sink in 
Deranged thoughts start to blink in
And out of my mind playin tricks on me
Sufferin with suicidal tendencies, since ten plus three
On bended knee I ask what’s intended for me cause I can’t cope
Some tellin me I ain’t shit, some tellin me I ain’t got no hope
Confessions of a young girl stressin
Sittin alone sweatin, burnin cigarettes into my flesh
Not knowin where I’m going, Can’t understand why I came
I can’t stand the rain, so I’m self inflictin pain 
Gotta get a grip
Gotta hold on a little tighter to the end of this rope, before I slip
Into insanity
Lost within calamity
Forgive me for I know not what I do but what I’ve done
I confess with my tongue
To you
He who created heaven and earth, but still I’m still confused
I don’t know what to do
Is there some way that you 
Could just clear my visions 
Can’t see you with false prophets and religions
But I’m driven to find the force that keeps me livin
But ifn’I might be mistaken
They tell me I’ll be held accountable and fried like bacon
But wait, when I didn’t ask to come here
Why is this all unclear 
I can’t understand, it all seems unfair
They tell me not to question God, but the question is
Will I make it to live another day cause times gettin hard
So you tell me to believe, have the faith of a mustard seed
Ask and I shall receive 
And you’re all I need
Indeed, this may be true 
I’m tryin to find my link to you
But, for all the things I do, I might not even make it through
Because we’re all born in sin, so nine times out of ten
We’re all gonna die in sin, same thing all over again
But, I don’t wanna fry God, I don’t even wanna die
So many tears I cry, so many years I try
I know I’ve done wrong I know I sing the same ole song
But truly I seek a righteous way, that’ll lead me to be strong
In spirit and mind, body and soul
Deliver me from evil make me whole
God take control
Before it’s too late, before you turn me over to a reprobate mind
Before you cast me in a lake of fire with my kind
Of sinners, for I am a sinner, I confess
I pray you forgive me and do bless
My soul to the very end 
This I ask God forgive me

Outro, B.G.O.T.I. (singing), Lady of Rage (talking):

Amen 
A-Men
Amen
A-Men
Amen
A-Men
Amen
A-Men

Hey God, can you hear me?
Can you see me?
I can see heaven there
Let me see, what’s wrong with me
Hey God, come take a walk with me
Hey God, come have a talk with me
Hey God

[The Jeffersons - TV theme]
We’re movin’ on up
To the east side (We’re movin’ on up)
To a deluxe apartment in the sky
We’re movin’ on up (We’re movin’ on up)
To the east side (We’re movin’ on up)
We finally got a piece of the pie

[Verse 1]
Watch these grown men get it, know fo’ sho’
Yo, get your back up off the wall and get your feet on the floor
You see the boy at the bar wit the glass so tall
When I’m done baby dogg I’ma show you Baltimore
Right now we gon’ party, Bacardi give me some more
It’s off the rack the club packed, I’m two-cut like two doors
Of course I do my two-step, I give ‘em too much
I mustered up bad, I drop ashes in my cup
I had enough they throwin’ bows, see they swingin and shit
I got my arm around this smut dame, puttin’ in work
Before we merk I got to book somethin’
So baby stop frontin’
I got the drink and the smoke
Ain’t got to buy nothin’
Not bluffin, it’s goin’ down understand me
I like my birds nasty, I burst in them cashmeres
Everything, and you know what I came for
Right now it’s goin’ down, let me on the dance floor

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Whoa now, that’s what the old heads say 
I party like it’s my birthday, drinkin and still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty give me what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin hot

[Verse 2]
I came to shake a load off, so take your coat off
Mixed drinks what you think, OJ and Smirnoff
I sip it all - hey, what can I say
See I just got paid so I’m feelin’ the swig and I’m tryin’ get laid
I’m buyin’ drinks and they love it
Divas growin’ cheaper
Gucci bag Gucci bucket
Takin’ shots from my cousin
He don’ know how to act
Came straight out the woods
And the club wit a sack
Like what you know no good
But I know I pimp nasty
Sneakers is off the meter
You can’t help wit the clap
Can’t help but the boogie
Get loose but don’t push me
We came so deep
And we’re all wearin’ hoodies
All my eighty-dime soldiers
What you doin’ tonight
Now, put yo eight-dimes up
You made enough for the night
Let’s take a break
Let’s spend some cake
You ain’t enjoyin’ your life
Yo, we been workin’ all week
So we gon’ do it tonight
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All my east-side boys put ya guns up
Pull out the knife cuz we gon’ party till the law comes
Them boys yellin’ where they from, I represent too
They throwin gang signs; see, I’m throwin’ W’s (Westside)
I’m screamin 80 dimes, I swear to God it’s goin down
I don’t remember where I parked, and I’m stuck in town
One night in Baltimore
I bet ya never leave
My boy I know I can’t help it but to love these streets
C’mon (We finally got a-)
C’mon, c’mon (We finally-)
C’mon, whoa now (We finally got a piece of the-)
C’mon, c’mon, whoa now (We finally-)
Whoa now (We finally-)
C’mon, c’mon, whoa now (We-we finally got a piece of the pie)
That’s what the old heads say

Drinkin’ and still thirsty

* send corrections to the typist

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --> Ice Cube

[LIL’ HAWK]
Comin’ right back at you nigga, it’s the Hawkster
Nigga I ain’t from Africa, I’m from Crenshaw Mafia
Gangsta no cut everytime that I’m flowin’
Ain’t scared of you niggas
Just to let you know, so
What the fuck do you bustas wanna do?
Flamed up, banged up shit nigga, I thought you knew that I’m a true
Young-ass muthafuckin’ Gee
With more bounce to the ounce sending you up with a beat and
I’m not tryin’ to get no punk-ass rapper
But when I catch your ass slippin’ nigga it’s on, on site
Tonight - I’ll be
Hangin’ on a bucket, pullin’ up in a G-Ride
Dump ‘em with a Glock on these niggas
Bitches everybody get shot
You should’ve been a Dogg but too bad that you not plot
Another murder homicide when I ride
I be smokin’ niggas up so you know I stay high, it’s do or die
With me Y-G Lil’ Hawkster
Nigga I ain’t from Africa, I’m from Crenshaw Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --> Ice Cube

[LIL’ HAWK]
West/Side C-M-G-B for life with me
On Crenshaw and Century the Mafia has made history
And even know punk niggas wanna do shit
We always stay down on this muthafuckin’ streets, peep
My hood is over populated with G’s
And I be hoppin’ on planes flyin’ way over sea’s and
Every place that the young nigga been some
Muthafucka wanna get put on the M and shit
And never even seen where’s at
But this nigga still down and pack a muthafuckin’ strap or bust a cap
Nigga on the drop of a dime and
We don’t give a fuck about no bitch-ass One-Time
It ain’t like you got a bulletproof punk
You ain’t takin’ me to jail
M and the L you gettin’ your head blown
Into pieces - just like this
On the 104th street is why the crime rate increased
Can’t fuck with Lil’ Y-G Hawkster
Nigga I ain’t from Africa, I’m from Crenshaw Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --> Ice Cube

[LIL’ HAWK]
Ain’t that about a bitch
They want me to turn in my strap
But a nigga like me on the B is sayin’ fuck that
Cause these niggas still want to blast
But when I’ll catch their ass slippin’ that’s the muthafuckin’ ass
I be blazin’ niggas up just - like the thai hash, so
Don’t be gettin’ sparked’ by this young sharp buddah and
It ain’t no muthafucka callin’ a cop
You sure stop with my Glock and you dead on the spot
Yellow tape
Red tag placed on your toe, these busta-ass niggas gotta go, gotta go, so
Hit the exit before I get to flex it
You can be black or
You can be a Mexican and
White boys gettin’ knocked the fuck out
Tryin’ to step to a G, you get socked in your mouth punk
You can’t fuck with this young G-B
Kickin’ up the most dust on this M-I-C, it’s me
Your number one nigga Lil’ Hawkster
Nigga I ain’t from Africa, I’m from Crenshaw muthafuckin’ Mafia

Mad as fuck, think about the payback... --> Ice Cube

[Royal T]
Another day, I cruise at the beach
Car sitting low, my homey’s in the next seat
It’s the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn’t get no play we got ignored
But there’s too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner cuz it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they’re getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain’t villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

[Chorus x2: Bizz]
From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don’t you know
We be rolling

[Latino]
I said trucks rolling by with the boom-booms in em
I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano’s got the switches to the side
The truck’s full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody’s styling, Profile’s Low
I’m driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a U and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

[Royal T]
Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody’s down to bang
Let the rags hang, it’s a Mexican thang
We ain’t villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

[Chorus x2]

[Royal T]
Cooling by the shore, hynas cooling in the sand
Lotion in their hand with a summertime tan

[Latino]
I said homies kicking back in the shade drinking brew
Have one or two, but they’re down to drink a few
Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain’t safe to drink and drive

[Royal T]
Four five burning, sea breeze blowing
Ladies dress sexy, body half showing
Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don’t forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it’s almost 1 o’clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi’s Taco Shop
Cutties wanna roll, the lab is where we sent em
Taking em to the room, we did the wild thing with em
But we ain’t ones to wine and dine
I’d rather cruise at the beach with the cutties in the summertime

[Chorus till fade]

"To the beat y’all.." (*repeat through song*)

[Milk]
When - Milk is on the mic you can say I’m milkin
All the rhymes I write are made of silk and steel
Yes y’all, I know the deal
Right about now I’ll tell you how I feel
When Milk is on the tables yes y’all I said it
I scratch like THIS! {*scratching*}
.. don’t forget
When I’m in a room it’s science I’m droppin
Supportin K-Rock as he goes hoe hoppin
Effect on the voice make the voice sound milky
.. the smooth rhymes made silky
I can rock a rhyme in two minutes or less
That’s on a bad day, at my best
At any time I can change my style
That is because I’m versatile
Like Nike’s on my feet, and..
Bobby’s on the beat, yo..
Giz is at the board, hey..
Gary press record!..
My colors red and white..
I rock it day or night, y’know..
My dad’s got my back..
Yo Giz this style is wack, so bust it

"To the beat y’all.." (*repeats as Giz scratches*)

[Giz]
When Giz has got the mic you can say I’m juicin
other MC’s as I start to get loose and rhyme
One time at the drop of a dime
Now I’ma clock the mic, now I’ma shock the mic
Now I’ma rock the mic while I go for mine
One day while I was walkin, girlies out stalkin
Brothers on the corner, sorta like hawkin
my style for a while cause I’m very versatile
I can grab the mic and rock a four minute mile
Now as I kept steppin, brothers kept sleppin
or should I say sleepin, while I was just keepin
the beat in my stride you know like a dance
Death defyin rope, just to enhance my look
Like a book or a well written rap ("To the beat y’all")
If I was (?) I’d be from the tap
Okay y’all, I’m almost there
Rockin down the street with all the fresh gear
Yo Milk, grab this mic, cause I’m outta here

[Milk]
Yo Giz, where’s your girl?  Go get her
Yo pull out the keys to your Jetta!
I’m MC Milk D, that’s DJ Gizmo
We’re the Audio Two
And we’re in full-l-l-l-l-l-l effffect, boyyyyyyyys!

"To the beat y’all.." (*repeat to end*)

[Apocalips (Sha Gotti)]
Frontin..
(Yo when you frontin son? I’ma murder one of y’all dudes
Hot shot one, now that nigga’s maggot food
Forty-fifth’ll make a nigga change his attitude
Rapid fire, tryin to hit him off this latitude)
My crew be livin like Kings but we ain’t Latin
You don’t know the half like the mothafuckin fraction
Tough actin like Tinactin, breakin backs in
Fatigue gear, blood on my boots, no more fashion
Trust me son, Ruthless you don’t wanna battle
(cuz you’ll be up shits creek without a fuckin paddle)
The heat is guarentee to seat you like a saddle
(Me and the God, we bringin beef like cattle)
Avoidin snakes that rattle (Rat tails that tattle)
Paranoid, gettin ice grilled by the double barrel
(Know what they say about these scared cats, tell everyone
but I got guns to make ‘em really run, you hear me son?)
Now here’s the plan, clear the block it’s like that
because they said they got gats, you think I fear that?
I hear that, procrastinate or retaliate, you’ll never win
The crews’ in Timbs, I knock you all down like roller blades
(Eh yo my gat is contagious, watch out you might catch it
Come in my town, think twice cuz shit is hectic
Blunts leavin you cuttin, you ain’t sayin nothin
Slit you from your fuckin forehead to your belly button)
Who you be? (Sha Gotti, always bustin a shotti and fuckin your hottie
High as Hell, beam up like Scotty, rock my hair knotty
Eighty cops can’t stop me so anybody try me)
No doubt, put your best man up, I kick his ass too
and bash you, and get my fuckin nut off like cashew
I don’t get down with these clowns cuz they don’t know me
Just hold me down and watch me bust ‘em down just like a stoggy
What? Guns I tote, amateurs take note, then you can quote/unquote
It’s Murder We Wrote (We murdered this son)

Chorus: all (Sha Gotti)
Murder We Wrote (Murder, murder)
Murder We Wrote (It’s murder on tape, boby bags, mental tags
Murder We Wrote (Niggaz don’t know the half while we ready to blast)
Murder We Wrote

[Infrared (Blizzard)]
Even the realest niggaz cry, fake ass niggaz lie
(cuz the Stakes is High like De La, that’s prob’ly why)
We all locked down in the streets, grab the heat and sad to release
(I’m sick of the beast, tired of these mothafuckas harassin
Disturbin the blunt passin) I see life flashin and techs cashin
Laced in fatique fashion (My team askin, what time kids be blastin?)
Smashin anythin in sight for the right price, quick to pull a heist
Got your fuckin guns off the Christ (So think twice
While me and my man, we kick the logic, I’m from the psychotic project
Lay me game down so we can get the prophet) Stop it
You don’t want, it’s Inf’ the first blunted (Blizzard)
The fifth (I puff lye to overcome it and turn into a savage
When I was young I used to see bullets fly past my carriage)
and not the average, we still tryin to live lavish
Ruthless Bastards, a deep mob bringin havoc
with mad wisdom, take over like communism
A military that’s ready to break down the prison
to set all my people free, so we could live equally
(Frontin hard like statues but ain’t no liberty
You got the beast to seem to question me, B-L-I-double Z-A-R-D
My style’s fat, and all jealous ones envy
I keep my eye on that pig, gimme, I got to take, gimme
So I could measure and get these mothafuckas pleasure
They all sick and we ain’t gettin no better
I’m gettin tired of seein my people’s funerals
So I figure blowin trees in my ritual)
Hold up, this shit ain’t over until I represent my soldiers
We form like Voltron and connect at the shoulders
Guns we tote, weed we smoke, Murder We Wrote
Take your trip across the boat and washed up like soap
and matter of fact dunn, yo Truck load up the Mac-one
Put me up on the top cuz I’m a put one in ‘em cats dunn
*gun shots*

Chorus 2X

Outro: Sha Gotti
Bring it! My whole crews’ blastin
You want somethin baby?
Fuck one time nigga
It’s always over

Heh whassup?
Here we go, here we go, here we go
One two for the money
or the show then three for the S-E
Hah hah, whassup?
It’s Ahmad, my man Mau’ made the track

[Ahmad]
Well it’s the niggerole, pump one more time
The jeeps I rock will never stop playin for keeps
And got more soul than a ghost I have mostly EVERYBODY UP
The masses movin asses so let the beat hit
And it ain’t gon’ quit ‘til you stop and say (no)
Cause I get more (ho!) than +Hip-Hop Hooray+
I rock steady, steady rocks don’t wanna box with God
Because I’m cool, givin props to the old school
And the West coast, who just toasted the return
of the funk with the fat beats for your trunk (so)
I walk and I stalk and I caulk(?) and I blast
Then I dip to the party, find me a honey and tag that ass
I saw a Puerto Rican freak who was all that
Tight pants for dancin, told her we gotta lambada
No restin yet black, cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)
Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it’s essential and necessary
I’m addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

[Ahmad]
It’s the return of the incredible man
who stands firm and rips up fakes without a cape
I’m great, I paid dues, kid how dare you respect me not
I had to get a tetanus shot cause fools bit but
now I’m back on deck, ready to wreck
and swing at every pitch til I’m rich (whoo!)
And that’s not long because I got a new song to sing
Throne the king cause all the fools just stepped loose (ooh)
Back to the party at hand, I want you movin and groovin
Workin that ass, havin a blast
I’m fast on the feel so pass the pill
to the kid that rocks, everybody jockin stop then
throw your hands up and wave ‘em from left to right
If you like the niggarole say (HO!)
But you know, no restin yet, cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

[Chorus]

[Ahmad]
Kick it what did I say? (Get up!) Think you better (get up!)
Part efficient in circumfrence and if you don’t jump
touch the ceiling with the center of your palm, use your right arm
Everybody standin, should love my sound cause it’s too down
or three, might be four, fifty-six, maybe one more
To blow, might I flow, can I go, I’m that one so
Bumrush the doors, keep the doors locked
All I need’s a small flock of fans, hands move to the bam-boom
of the bass drum, when you hear the thump of the bass
Jump while you’re actin dumb, yell where you come from
(West coast) with the new soul scenario
(Just fo’) us to control your stereo
Ahmad I flip and rip kids and crews to shreds
Mau’ will lay a beat down like the Feds
I guess all should say yes y’all cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

[Chorus]

[Ahmad]
Whassup?  That’s Ahmad and the Joneses
We on this mic, for the ninety-three, to the ninety-four
and more

Yeah!

Alright!

Hey listen I don’t mean to seem rude
I just speak truth
Can I, get this whole scene through with some key moves
See, older kids told me I was a weak youth
Now it’s just a bitterness I eat fruit
Even with my sweet tooth
Nice to meet you
And it’s ironic how you never heard of us you were too busy wearing sheep suits
We don’t need proof
To walk far in these shoes
We’re unorthodox, let your mind 3-2
Yeah
Talk about lyrics well I got millions
Most of which I think you wont admit
Are fucking brilliant!
And if you wanna hate then tell me
That line goes straight to the pussies, no Brazilians
Let me tell ‘em
We’re bringing something new to the table
Don’t lot anyone who knows me
I refuse to be nasal
Yeah!
And there are bitches who aren’t usually faithful
I keep looking to the people that I use to rate like please listen!

[Chorus]
Cause you need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you at all
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you at all
You need me

You don’t have to ask twice
Yeah
For the past 5 years
Had a hard time in bars fights
They’d laugh like
You ain’t a rapper bruv, you aren’t hype
No I’m sick like cancer but that ain’t my fucking star sign
And I can’t lie
Do not perceive me as the rapper type
Ain’t bringin’ swagger, but some fact an I analyse
The fact I leave an arena hanging like the stalactites
More for your money that’s asda price
No I don’t hassle I don’t hide
Your acting like most guys
Who are having the pros hide
To gather they’re own vibes
So if you wanna tell me change styles that’s fine
Those that mind, don’t matter, those that matter don’t mind
That’s the message were sending
Insult was never intended
People took pleasure inventing
But
I remember the telling
The path was never in question
Were artists at work
And I color don’t need you
America spelling

[Chorus]
Cause you need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you at all
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you
You need me man I don’t need you at all
You need me man I don’t neeeeed yooooooou!

[Damajah]
Yeahh, he don’t know
The man called Damajah (Damajah!)
Longside Chasm, Thundamentals
This how we doin this ya’know
HUH

[Chorus: Damajah {Vocals} (+Thundamentals)]
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT’S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU’RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT’S COS WE’RE LIVER THAN YOU)

[Verse 1: Jewson]
One I met a guy who followed me round, kept calling me Psycho
I said ‘you crazy, why the fuck you stalking a cyclone’
Thundamental mind-dome, I vibrate your soundscapes
Micro to macro, while I migrate the ground shakes
Yo I’ll break it down mate, how about that
Straight from the outback, shout to K-town cats
Matters(?) maps where I found rap
Now I sport a raw flow, fat like chicken at Oporto’s
Get the house packed when I talk bones
Got you singing ‘Bravooo!’
Build a bigger picture like I’m spitting out Picaso
Bring in the wack, I’ll implement an embargo
If you children relax, we’ll sing pissed into the arvooooo

[Verse 2: Tuka]
I’m just that slick partoloco representing for me buddyo
From the Mountains to the city with that coolbocabilardio
Check me aradio, I bust from sun up to sun down
Untilhente my words will never be dumbed down
Run sound, and no body tighter than we
We chuumed out, in the studio lighting the trees
I cypher for free, but pay me when I’m gonna retouch
On any track Chaz gives us man we running amuck
Keep writing that stuff that’s out to get you high as my life
Live on the mic, my freestyle’s as fly as a kite
We’re writing at night to beats that’s designed to excite
And get you hyped like a gym junkie riding a bike

[Chorus]
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT’S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU’RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT’S COS WE’RE LIVER THAN YOU)
Open up them eyes up 

[Verse 3: Jewson]
Yo I’m side-stepping these geezers
Hi-tek, mind set - style fresh as a fetus
Mic checking your speakers like venomous creatures
Wild predators with dentures like leopards and cheetah’s
Either beleieve us or GET SHRED INTO PIECES
Not to mention any skeptics get lectured on what the weapon of speech is
(nahhhh man)
Yo my methods a secret, never release it til I see fit
We speak deep shit like Killah Preist did
Raw truth - like I’m witness in a courtroom
Chasm on the beats kickin rythm I can talk to 
I live within the cypher, fuck the vile on your tele
Like a Mexican cook - my rhyme is fire through your belly

[Verse 4: Tuka]
Reppin a hood where it’s known will get your necklace took
Have you running down the road like a headless chook
Everywhere I go - I’m met with a restless look
But crooks still compliment me on my excellent hooks
Inspect the books for gems, sort of like a gold miner
We rolling on bold tires on rims of lowriders
No sins from ghostwriters, just sims from dope rhymers
Got love from the beginning so here’s to old timers (Cheeeers!)
But right now it’s the rise of the new school
Voodoo curse if ya think that you’re too cool
Got my pool cues cocked, now I’m ready to break
And smash balls in the face of a treacherous snake (suuuuckers!)

[Chorus] 
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT’S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU’RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT’S COS WE’RE LIVER THAN YOU)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up and then we can rise up
(IT’S THE RISE OF THE NEW)
And if you wise up, wise up, wise up, and then we can rise up
(IF YOU’RE PISSED THEN I GUESS IT’S COS WE’RE LIVER THAN YOU)
Open up them eyes up - And wise up.

[Damajah] {Vocals}
... They say who will come teach em, they say who will come school them
Watch they don’t cross-over on them, you tame them
That way I’ma rise up and take them

yeahhh man...

[Wale]
Folarin, Double M
Slip N’ Slide collabo; let’s get it!

What you talkin’ ‘bout?
Know I’ve been a rumor well let me call you out
Where you put your crown? You got a little style
Let me put it down until you walkin’ on the cloud
Look, the time’s now, I’m intrigued
Whenever I browse I’ll be sure you get things
Yeah, see what I did there
Slip inside of her body until she get there

[Chorus: Sebastian Mikael]
I can’t lie, when I.. watch my ba-by
Her lip gloss pop, just came from the spa
Hair done too, but girl, that was four shots ago
Now you can’t, be-lieve, that you did it, with, me (ohh)
Cause you wasn’t sayin’ that last night

[Sebastian Mikael]
Girl, I swear to God, people pay for a smile likes yours (like yours)
And I’m loving it, chea (and I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it)
Girl, I swear to God, they’ll pay for ass like yours (like yours) 
If it wasn’t there, yeah, yeah (and I’m rubbin’ it, I’m rubbin’ it)
Ohh, ohh

[Interlude: Sebastian Mikael]
You wanna know if we can make this confidential
Between me and you (we already did it)
Between me and you (we already did it)
Remember when I said I’m tryna find something to get into
I was talkin’ ‘bout you (we already did it)
I was talking about you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Yeah, haha
This ain’t real baby, what they talkin’ ‘bout?
Ain’t no rapper that’s alive call Folarin out
Now can you deal with it? I’ll probably run you out
Cause I never tell a woman where my body call
Lemme tell ‘bout last night (ohh yeah)
I don’t remember much of last night (last night)
How I can say it keeping it polite
Umm, you left once, but she came twice so get it right - WHOO!

[Chorus]

[Sebastian Mikael]
I swear to God, and I promise I won’t tell nobody
Your privacy is safe with me (and I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it)
Girl I swear to God I wanna get plenty time to touch you, yeah, yeah, yeah
(And I’m rubbin’ it, I’m rubbin’ it) Ohh, ohh

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

Verse 1:
We rollin’ five cars deep, all logo thangs:
A Cutty, a Caddy, two OJ’s and a drop Mustang.
My nigga’s fucked in the Cutty gettin’ donuts, fishtail
And smokin’ up the block and "Two hun’ed block" is what he yellin’.
Hyped as fuck, gone of the Hen and dank,
Bitches all over the place, jockin’ niggas off gold Daytons.
6-7 lock is what I’m rollin’ when it’s sunny.
Fo’ figured, five block to keep my shit runnin’.
Gold thangs, spin in pearl pains, shinin’
And everywhere I go, niggas ask if they can buy in.
Bitches jock everywhere I go,
That’s why I roll solo at the sideshows.
Creepin’, peepin’ out these hoes,
Cuz the first one to look is the first to get chose.
So come take a ride and let me show you how it’s done,
Up in the state of Cali-funk-ia.
Nigga.

(chorus x2)
Roll, roll, roll yo’ voges up and down the street.
All the niggas drop the tops and hit the spot, if you’re ridin’ on gold
D’s.

Verse 2:
Sippin’ on some hindu, blowin’ on some indo,
Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
chrome.
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain’t ne’er be mine,
Hungarian P.R., now I’ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin’
job.
It’s funk in the town of the fog.
Too many deaths, ain’t nobody down for the squad.
Rollin’ plushed out exact like your Cadillac,
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin’ tracks from Vice,
Can’t wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight.
You know them sound recycled clubs,
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a glocks
and then a bunch of unknown damn buds.
Niggas poppin’ the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus’, Caddy paint wit drops what’s out, pushin’ a
Bump.
Y’knaw’t’s how we do it in the town and I was cold,
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues.

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut’n nice, it’s like life, I’m livin’ off in my buildin’s,
Slangin’ that ‘caine, get regular cash back, a nigga’s spillin’.
Ready and willin’ for some freaks to leap off in these streets,
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin’ around with one of these ammos
under they belts.
More niggas I’m killin’ than killed, then I be up on tilt.
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas.
Mug, that’s when I’m slug-killed, still makin’ these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin’ I’ll think it him and dark kill.
It was a thrill, comin’ up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this.
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf,
A young nigga that’s showin’ off, ready steady pushin’ that work.
Pushin’ a Caddy on Originals and Voges,
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud’fuck’s.

(chorus till fade)

[Intro: Maino]
Uh! Niggas is dead!!! Dead I tell you! Can’t be serious!
Know what’ll happen when you take three of the realest niggas in Brooklyn!
Street niggas and such, mix ‘em all up in one track, It’s Brooklyn!!!
Uh! Heh heh! Can’t be serious! Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse One: Maino]
Motherfuckers wanna kill me but don’t got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine that spark
Cause whether you for or against us my murderous henchmen
Leave shots in the same hoodie you dressed in
No it’s not a miracle baby I’m that incredible 
Street certified come on salute a general
Your outta my league I refuse to war with you
Simply I got more guns than you
Keep the tek where my son live the llama at the other house
Shotty in the car streetsweeper at my mama’s house
No sense I lost my damn mind now
One shot’ll leave abd gun powder around your eyebrows
I’m the realest you niggas better comply now
Make way for the king the streets is mine now
I’m G and shit stripes like Adidas’s
Chris Brown damn right I beat a bitch!!!!!!!
This year the game ‘gon let the crooks in
Till the day that I die it’s Brooklyn!

[Verse Two: Red Cafe]
It’s R...
I hope y’all, know I’m comin for that crown
And my niggas hungry, don’t bring your jewelry around
‘Cause we eat food, and I got some broads to squeeze too
In the +Boiler Room+ supplyin "Vin Diesel"
Dressed in the ice, it’s dark, dim the lights
in the jails and I reach you, it’s nothin to send a kite
And my dogs all bite, we be right in the hood
Down for anything, even knockin down Suge
I’m necessary, see the ghetto need Red
They know I got the juice like A-Rodriguez (WHAT ELSE?)
And I’ma come clean with the bump-bump thing
Extended clips, like I’m on somethin
And if you pickin out Gs’ in a line-up (yep)
It’s only a matter of time ‘fore you get lined up (yep)
And you get bucked down, I’m from Bucktown
Shakedown, ready for war, wassup now?!

[Verse Three: Uncle Murda]
I’m from where dudes they got shit
Where dudes’ll kill they man like ‘Pone killed Rich
Or they’ll sell drugs to they own mamas
Long as she come correct, with them motherfuckin dollars (What you want, mommy?)
Or they might let her go for a dollar, black
If she two dollars short, they gon’ tell her to holla back (Can’t help you mommy)
You know me, I’m right where the trail m
when the club like where duke I’m beefin wit baby mom at (Baby!)
My lil’ brother locked up for a shooting
He remind me of me, I was a bad influence (Sorry grandma!)
Man, I had so many guns in the crib
Saw so many people who wanted to be like me when they got big (f’real!)
I’m cocky, AIN’T a emcee iller than me
And I know for sure ain’t none of these dudes realer than me! (They not!)
I’m the future, I’ll shoot ya, ain’t hard to tell
If I ain’t the hottest, it got to be snow in the L
I’m tired of these sucka ass niggas
They get record deals to start frontin like they killas (It ain’t snowin down there)
Now, buck buck, before all this rap shit
they was goody-two shoes in the hood - They ain’t never clapped SHIT!!!
(OH!)

[Verse Four: Busta Rhymes]
Cock back and and watch the Mac push
Your fuckin head off, now buss a shot for East Flatbush!!!!!!!!!
Only time we pull it and party
And waste bullets without hurtin somebody it’s the fourth of July!!!!!!
Fireworks pop in the air
Takin them chances rinsin the cartridge cuttin the tree branches
(IN BROOKYLN!!!!!!) Even the children will catch it
That’s why when we was younger we borrow and trade ratchets
And get it like Omar from The Wire from a young bastard
And when the police come run up in Pancho deli and stash it
(IN BROOKYLN!!!!!!) Rust niggas will start to dig in them
Pockets as if my name was Drac, Hawk and Pig and ‘em
Drop it, I commend my niggas that’s in the dirt
And, go ‘head and where the crown cause my niggas puttin the work in
You know I be the God of the street
The people say so I relinquish wearin the crown cause Gods wears a halo

[Chorus: Flirta D]
Drive by
Drive by
Drive by
Drive by

[Verse 1: Wiley]
Nobody’s safe in the war, I know this, nobody’s safe
When I step into the field I can’t see nobody’s face
Roll through like a Highlander, call me Wiley MacLeod
I tell people who don’t want to see her twerking: ‘Listen, Miley’s allowed’
If I get called by a worthy opponent then I’m all up for it
I’m highly skilled in a battle, that’s why I might push my luck with it
Don’t give a fuck with it, like, who’s chucking it?
Fill the clip with the lyrics, put the clip into the gun and start bussing it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wiley]
If I ever let a war go it means donny can’t test with the flow
Oh no, might get pissed because you never got a shot at a pro
To the shit there’s levels, and real like rebels, and I’m one of them
I might get called out by amateurs but I don’t know none of them
Ready? I’m ready
Make a spitter fade out like Blackberry
I spay a whole crew of spitters cos I’m that heavy
Don’t back out if they start attacking me
I tell an MC ‘You must prepare for war’
Frontline any time they declare war
Lyrics in the clip, get ready, no discussing it
I put the clip into the gun and start bussing it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Wiley]
I drive by on MCs, take shots at them
They take shots at me, the whole lot of them
I wonder who will bail out on a slick one
Cos I’m like thunder when I strike them down on a quick one
See, I’ve got an aura, sick one, check it out
And the spitters on my team don’t mess about
Dons who ain’t ready for the war
Then get them out, see them stepping out
The others stepping up, you can’t forget about
That’s why I put the lyrics in the clip, no bluffing
Then I put the clip into the gun and starting bussing

[Chorus]

   
   Hey girl, stop it, you know you oughta stop it x3
   Hey girl, stop it, you know you oughta stop!
   
   Verse 1
   
   Ha, so you say you’re being true blue
   I don’t know who you’re being true to
   It’s not me, it must be you
   Yourself and nobody else, so put it on a shelf
   Those words that you’re sayin’
   I know all about the games that you’re playin’
   But just in case you don’t think I do
   Allow me to run it down to you
   After I’m through I’ll disappear
   The buck stops here, dear...
   
   Repeat chorus
   
   Verse 2
   
   You have a man on the side, tryin’ to provide
   For three little children and a sickly wife
   He went to the disco on a Friday night
   You laid out the bait, he started to bite
   He called you honey, he gave you money
   You laughed in his face, you thought he was funny
   Funny lyin’ to make alibis
   On why he wasn’t by his wife’s side
   You have gold chains, furs and things
   You cursed when he wouldn’t give you diamond rings
   What made it all come to an end
   He said he’d leave his wife and children
   That wouldn’t do for a freak like you
   So you told him to pursue somebody new
   He found they’d gone, he’s all alone
   And he’s callin’ you on the telephone
   So you told him, "Be cool, disappear
   The buck stops here, dear..."
   
   Repeat chorus
   
   Verse 3
   
   You head uptown, the man you see
   He makes his living in the streets
   He’s living fast, but you live faster
   Making him think that he’s your master
   His money is spent paying your rent
   So you deal with his arrogance
   He doesn’t really know your residence
   So you lived the life of elegance
   Then when it’s discovered you a lover to his brother
   When brother to brother, they talk to one another
   You go undercover, cos he found out
   Exactly what you’re all about
   The only way to bring it to an end
   You go to the police, you turn him in
   Now he’s in prison, all alone
   And he’s callin’ you on the telephone
   So you told him, "Be cool, you got five years
   The buck stops here, dear..."
   
   Repeat chorus
   
   Verse 4
   
   Upstate you fake high society
   Just trying to be a corporate lady
   Meetin’ with the rich, talk politics
   But they don’t know you’re just a slick chick
   Usin’ your charm, silk on your arm
   The social elite will all compete to beat
   You’re livin’ the life of luxury
   Smilin’ all the while over cups of tea
   The smile you use will abuse
   Any man you choose is sure to lose
   They’re left behind while you go far
   Eating caviar, drivin’ a Jaguar
   It came to an end, good things don’t last
   The women told the men about your past
   So you packed your bags, when you get home
   They’re callin’ you on the telephone
   But the ladies make sure you can’t go back there
   They said, "The buck stops here, dear..."
   
   Repeat chorus
   
   Verse 5
   
   There are countless others, silly lovers
   When you count them, count me out
   Don’t talk sweet lies, shut your mouth
   Cos I know what you’re all about
   I’ll tell you something, you’re all about nothing
   Just a pretty girl thinkin’ she’s a star
   Give me the keys to your car
   I always wanted to drive a Jaguar
   Hey baby, I go crazy over gold chains
   My pockets are dry and I need some money
   Don’t even laugh, there’s nothin’ funny
   Whenever you speak just call me honey
   All your old ways will have to end
   I make the rules, and the rules don’t bend
   The first rule, baby, you will adore
   Tell all your friends, "Don’t call no more"
   It’s a cryin’ sin, don’t shed no tear
   The buck stops, you know the buck stops
   The buck stops, everybody rocks
   And the buck stops here dear.

Since the double XL there ain’t a spot that they don’t be peakin
And live big number one record northeast region

To make all this money and drive all y’all sick
And I never, ‘gon, stop remix
My own shit is problems whenever I drop

[ VERSE 1: Bosco Money ]
To all the kings with diamond rings
And the slept on power to pull some strings
I know you’re thinkin I’m the last survivor
The jet black tinted-out Bentley driver
62 and Madison, scopin females
American Express take care of the details
Cause I’m covered till I’m smothered like the Shah of Iran
Motorcade down when I roam the land
"Window, James, I see something I like
Park on the corner, underneath the light"
"Nice shorts, hon’ - takin a run?
‘joyin the sun, havin fun?
I got a posse, a beeper, and money
And you’re lookin fly - like a bunny"
"James, let her in, she’s approachin the car
And pass me back a bottle of Chateau Noir"
I’m bout to do this right, like make the move
Until I’m uptight, outta sight, and in the groove
"Cigarette, James - thank you"
"Now darling, what would you like to do?"
We got the radio pumpin, they’re playin my jam
I like the doors on the ride, it’s auto-slam
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
>From New York to the Netherlands
If that’s too much road for your mind to pave
Feel the breeze and catch the wave

\tCatch
\tCatch the wave

[ VERSE 2: Bosco Money ]
Eager beaver, fixin it down
Chubby little sucker like a ???? hound
Can’t let no water get inside the crib
So every now and then he might have to adlib
But that’s alright, he don’t get uptight
Got lots of friends who got network light
So week in and out, he ain’t stuck
Broke countless mirrors, and still got luck
So by sundown, the damage fixed
Give it a smack with his tail and cracks open a Twix
He been savin and cravin and slavin for
You know it tastes so good, he start rockin the floor
Side to side, with the Flatbush Rock
Sayin, "All I wanna do is turn back the clock
Cause I’m a old beaver now, and I ain’t got much
But yo - I still got the touch"
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
>From New York to the Netherlands
If that’s too much road for your mind to pave
Feel the breeze and catch the wave

\tCatch
\tCatch the wave

[ VERSE 3: Bosco Money ]
Old McDonald sittin on a fence
Livin in the present tense
Looked out on the settin sun
After all his work was done
Thought of places far away
And how he’d like to live each day
Took his rifle in his hand
And struck out on the desert sand
Down a mile or so he went
Qualified for government
Now he’s livin on the moon 
Watchin politics balloon
Knottin money round the clock
Got his family hooked on rock
All his suits is gabardine
Envy is a shade of green
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
>From New York to the Netherlands
If that’s too much road for your mind to pave
Feel the breeze and catch the wave

[The Reverend William Burk]
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk’s mind in a deep space
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk’s mind in a deep space
We creates at a G’s pace, for heaves sake
And for goodness grace, we burn fakes at the stakes
Throw your hands in the sky, and wave ‘em side to side
Drunk funk and skunk for getting crunk to ride
Let me hear you holla homicide
She was murdered on the dance floor, more cash in the register drawer
My whole crew pay our rep in the score
We go to war for the pure for sure
To add even more law to the thought of a cure
A hula hoop was 360 degrees, shiny afro blow in the breeze
Used to scoop shabobaloop in the coupe from the green
Queen, I’m James, all through to gold women in tans
I get it down for the CREAM, I help achieve they dream

[Shavo Odadjian]
Check this shit out...
22 frames a second, paradox shift shocks
Sword swings, swift slice, serious sounds
Spectacular shine, cypher supreme, sucker divine
The curious mind, the furious who rhyme
Sustain the streets low, sacrifice slip storyline
Sicks got sight eye
Stimulate strike sonic and sudden, sophisticated souls stay stainless
Salute, spit swat, spine, subtle severe
Snow blind, subliminal signs
Speculate six superficial stereotypes, stereotypical skeptics
Epics, except swine
Skeptics, seen in septics, sick spiritual swill spend all
Spank, curious, sick, sonic, sick, super, sick, stereo, sick
Syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[The Reverend William Burk]
Krispy Kremes in the suitcase, laser beams in the briefcase, onion
rings for the cheapskates
Diamond rings on the finger of my baby cakes
Achozen few we only plays for the high stakes
Series of silver, swindling service decipher the suttle signals
The spinner, spindling yard on the school
A student who took who for school in a Cee Allah Rule
Dropping a jewel on this educated fool
Simulated sonar signals, space symbol, severe civil rivalries
Split brothers and sisters
Twisters and blizzards, blow the gizzards out of lizards
We sizzle wizards, ninjas, gold dentures, trenches

[Shavo Odadjian]
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[Beretta 9]
Supposed stay in school and show and study
Supplements is needed, student instead of a slack skip sleet
Slapped him in the scalp and seen ya
Soon to the sent, to vibe the streets
Man I was stupid, straight up sick, decided supreme
Story, just a real to scene
A soldier stay strapped with a sub machine
Soon to shot, subtracted, stretched out
On the sidewalk, had to be scraped with a spatula
The shit stuck to the ceiling, my skills so sick
So I must say, to what if you second, sucker

[RZA]
Okay, kay, kay
Kill cutlery knives, kill conniving kids in it
Kid crazy cookies to corrupt you kiddy kittens
Kicking off committing criminal capers, cutting Klansmen
Kid, I build Kurtis cube kite to Kansas
Cranium like axles in kings they cause brain cells
To snap crackle and pop, like Kellogg’s Krispies
Colliding kaleidoscopes for visual collisions
Captain Caveman, want Colonel chicken
Cookies in a rock, Obama like Barack
OK-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R, Z-A, stop
Super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
Soak sweet Sandra’s sheets til they sexy and steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman’s socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, left the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra-sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra, sacra, sacra
I said, super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
I soak sweet Sandra’s sheets til she steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman’s socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Staten Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, leaves the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice

Ride around on new dubs, keep on makin’ new bucks
Like what, girl my game is mad rude
If your friend got a man, I’m gonna kick game to you
And I know just after one line, you leavin’ with me, right?
Give you such a good time, that’s only for one night
And look ma, keep on the low, please don’t tell
Want my number? na, I don’t want you callin’ my cell

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Southstar]
Uh, uh, yo help me out on this one
Yo, yo, can I kick it (YES YOU CAN)
Cats now leavin’ the club in the caravan
With about 12 chicks in the caravan (that’s right)
So funny, you performed, now I’m leavin’ with yo fans
You can catch Southstar, leavin’ in a Benzo
With my name on the plate, so it’s not a rental
20 inch rims, X Box, T’s in the dash (nice, nice)
Best believe tonight, that I’m gettin’ some ass (ass)

[Smilez]
Yo, and I’m out before the car close out
With some dirty south chick, that can put more than 2 dicks in her mouth

[Southstar]
And I’m out with the New York mami
Just met her tonight, damn, she already callin’ me papi

[Smilez]
And I got a rash down on her knees, you can believe
That the man with the shit is S M I L E Z
Wastin’ my time ma, you know the deal
You ain’t gettin’ no dough, I’m just keepin’ it real

[Chorus] - 4X w/ variations from Dakari

[Dakari] - (starts in chorus & solo until fade)
Goin’ out, goin’ out (repeat, until end)

This is only the beginning that ain’t got no end, nigga
Only the beginning, baby
This is only the beginning that ain’t got no end

[ Nogoodus ]
Let off a couple, for all my niggas startin trouble
Souls are lost up in the shuffle, now apocalypse will bubble
When the sky begins to crumble I’ll exist amongst the galaxy
The suns, the stars, the moons, in its universal majesty
Simply verbal mastery is absurd when I spit this
This lyricist stay on mad judge and DA’s shitlist
They try to prosecute me but I murk they only witness
Now go and get your critics, they favorite rappers and mimicks
While I leave em with a slitted wrist, stick up em at they tickets
With my niggas Psycho Les and Corona don nigga JuJu
My style move crowds like ( ? ) in Honolulu
Holdin mics like how the Source is, ram a fork through your fortress
Nogoodus be victorious, you other rappers get off it

[ Psycho Les ]
It’s the narc’ie, taggin up places with a sharpie
Faces in the dark be blazin ( ? )
When they see us, World’s Famous Beatnuts, they greet us
Honeys wanna meet us, duckies try to defeat us
But that’s Impossible like a Mission Tom Cruise couldn’t even accomplish
I’m leavin after I bomb this
Properly, bring the noise to your property
You probably call the cops on me, it’s gotta be
The Beatnuts if it’s rare to the ear
This year and every year, we gettin props everywhere
I don’t fuckin care what you claim hip-hop is
My production bounce pretty like brown titties that are topless
It’s the horniest, Psycho bulgin
Son be the corniest like Michael Bolton

[ Rawcotiks ]
...part of me probably
Cause a catastrophy, me and my faculty
Actually it was extinct till when we linked 
And to think these bitches pack millies in the mix
Makes me proud to be aloud and speak on how
And what and like Rakim I’m movin the crowd
I hold my gun with a psychotic grin, my metropolis
Populates a gang of arsonists
Build like a architect, the street publicist
Hey yo, this is the issue
I wet bodies and rip tissues, my niggas miss you

As I get hold a few things be gettin harder
Many kids be gettin larger but I’m keepin my guards up
To protect myself from a wealthy environment
Not to face my dark side is my first assignment
But I can’t face that with a mack or a squaw
It takes myself and my mind to take charge
But since I’m a outcast, no American Dream
Brains to work, cause I’ma search for a scheme
I hang with a gun cause everyone has one
I move along with the world cause there be no re-runs
Nigga

[ A.L. ]
You know the circumstance said to me: You don’t stand a chance
I cause a avalance to put you in a ambulance
You lost sight, makin the moves you frostbite
Same cowards that be duckin to the sounds of exhaust pipes
Scared to tell, paranoid in this ghetto life
Razor blade, gunplay is how they settle fights
We into witchcraft, quick cats, they flip fast
Stocking cap, facin a gun through a thick class
The bankteller make you richer than a gram seller
You in the jam, fella, doin time like Mandela
But check the consequence, ain’t too late to switch plans
They say I’m broke but in my mind I’m a rich man
The way I strike you recognize that you need time
Don’t need no psychics, through your eyes I can read mines
While you feed swine, while you breathe wine, while you eat crime
I take the time to make rhymes to make my seeds shine
With efficient flows, so duck when the pistol blows
( ? ) of breath, a kiss of death under the mistletoe

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... I’d like to welcome you
to the Marvelous Adventures of S.S.R.

[La the Darkman]
I watch snakes as they try to get close to me
Chop their head off, put it where it’s supposed to be
In a plastic bag, like groceries
Have ya casket surrounded by rosary
Fake gangsta, I’ma expose ya G
Send ya record label into foreclosure, B
That just make more room for my company
Named The Embassy, you ain’t friend to we
Sing Sing/La Familia, we family
Right there on our hips where the hammers be
While bang ya, won’t let no cameras see
Most killings get done in privacy
Without a patch on my eye still a pirate, see?
Keep a cannon and a knife in case I have to take a life
When the coke turn to oil I’ma hit with the ice
And the yae’s so pure I don’t have to hit it twice

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
This Sing Sing Regime we gon’ make a mil
Get the world high like they all swallowed a pill
Gettin’ money so you know I threw diamonds in my grill
Keep a 4x4 wheel without a record deal

[Willie the Kid]
Aiyo niggaz try and pull a fast one on the team
I put you in a full body cast with the sling
Forty cal mag put a gash in ya spleen
Respect Gun Rule, Sing Sing the Regime
Nigga you a bitch, you could pass for a queen
The first one to split, you the last on the scene
Willie so clean, cop a Jag for the spring
Willie so green, with the hash for the bling
Money got real when I graduated college
I did everything, still kept the flow solid
If rap was a house, I kept the floor polished
I bubble like soap, Cascade, Palmolive
Cuz when you this good, it’s hard bein’ modest
The Prince of the hood sippin’ drinks with the olive
Homes in the Aspens, million dollar cottage
Me and Big Joe, Sean Combs, Chris Wallace
Me and Lason, King Kong, Godzilla
A .357, yeah the odds get realer
Good against this? I wouldn’t recommend it
I’m real in the field with the skill, you pretended
It’s not a scrimmage, it’s more like a championship
I get money like a champion gets
The crowned Prince...

[Outro: Willie the Kid]
The Come Up Boys, Sing Sing Regime
Motherfuckers...

[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
Concentrate on detailed
Portrayals of entrails, impaled with nails
If all else fails, eliminate you
Blot you out, extinguish, got you now
Hard like calluses on Mingus’ fingers
Dialysis, life support, paralysis
Bring a knife to court, attack the judge
Never back down or budge, I’ll crack your skull
You fag, you pack the fudge
Excessive plasma, guts, asthma, respiratory fucked
Chronic disease, can’t breathe
Like amputees chopped at the knees
In pampers, babies, vulnerable
Sculpture your skull
Ultimately pulverize
Cultivate the sickly
Prickly, pointy bayonets lodged
Inside your larynx, march
Divide

[ CHORUS: Necro ]
Real shit
Peel clips
Peel flesh
Real fresh

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
It’s American Psycho, sicko, swift flow
Nutso, schizo, mental ward, clip board said so
The best though, you can get a big surprise with a red bow
When lead blow, dance with a Tec like techno
Hit the deck and let go till the nose on the sket glow, wet foes
Hard lyricist
Pa, hit you with shit that chart next to Rx barbiturates
March of the carnivorous
Mark the kids cartridges to spark y’all gibberish
But here’s more of the morbid, mortician
Tools to maul with, morgue shit, mortars hit
Who nice? Lay ‘em on ice like walruses
War you want, then war it is
Fuck all the hooks and choruses
I’m bringing it back to Nautilus
Mind borderline disorder, kid
Shell your back like tortoises
Let loose till it tore the wrist
Adore the kick, raw shit, you silhouette-boxin
No oxygen, still the best rockin
Frontline gunner for the game, hunter with an aim
You a lame, you a runner for the caine
Get slumped in the slum in the summer in the rain
Champ from Queens, dance for the team
Till it land a ambulance on the scene
Tramps in jeans, trampoline
I chant the theme of Benjamins, Grants of green
On the real, you get peeled like a tangerine
Try to kick, get the cramps, hear the sample fiend
Get an oz of OD dosage
Put it in pots and rock like the old KISS
Make the whole strip swarm like the locust
You out of focus, broke with the bogus shit

[ CHORUS: Necro ]

.

[Nefertiti]
Ay!

Black prophet, ya better believe, born to stop it
Yes I was, asalaam alaikum, not sayin I’m no apostle
Sometimes I pack a pistol, revolution calls
Ya better believe, from Mecca to Watts I’m speakin to all of, y’all
This (?? ??) will be the Final Call
So listen now, if you will sit back and let me speak the truth
Verbal in your wisdom, amounts to sayin nothin troop
Revolution calls, so pick up the gun it’s on the run
Hip-Hop here, Africa here, now some live in fear
No fear, I clean myself don’t put my backpack on the shelf
so’s I can feed myself..
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Take it personal G, I’m speakin the truth and bitin the fruits
Drop the seeds get off your knees, don’t be beggin Allah for mercy
Allah God, ain’t no time for false prophets
Pullin metaphors out my pocket, I need to stop it
Grab the snake, by his head, make sure when you passin through
Ya best believe, from Mecca to Watts, I’m speakin to all of, you
Tell me revolution didn’t come true, in ninety-two
I took ‘em down from Western, to Slausson, along with you
Hypocrite no liar, I didn’t burn ‘em down for nuttin
From Mecca to Watts you best believe though, show yo’ face
Unless you holdin up the place, be movin on
Revelation come, I won’t be singin no song
Tryin to push no mountin, or bathin in no fountain
Move them apples out my face I coulda sworn I drank ‘em down
Not tryin to be profound hysteria (?) I’m bringin ‘em down
Still some, they hide behind the cross, now who’s the boss?
Just because I meditate, doesn’t mean I think I’m great
The devil, you’re meddlin with my fate, nope we’re not too late
Drop them on your left and, pick up your right arm
I-S-L-A-M don’t think I’m slangin Islam
My people, they’re witnesses the strongest in the belly of the beast
I say pack a piece, (?) just don’t give me no grief
To say the least, now Jeffrey Dahmer had a piece
I step on the scene, friction (?) so you can see me
You know what I mean, tell-lie-vision will deceive you
At the age of three, you’ll never be no good nigga
And I suppose you believe the devil
How you figure revolution comes
You better believe I’m pullin the trigger
Some sit back, and they choose to be rememberin
I’m stompin in my Timberlands, I’m comin at ya
African, marketplace, nod or sing or show my face
Reminiscin on, how we used to be, huggin and kissin
Now we con-dit-ioned
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Spiritual acceptance, inside your residence
Lookin inside yourself, somethin what’s on your mind
Now that we’re ropin and copin on the straight and narrow path
Don’t be, hidin behind no superficial laughs
I guess I’m drinkin dirty water can’t afford no Evian
From Mecca to Watts you best believe the revolution’s on
Elijah Muhammad said, that many of us are soon to rise
Blue sky high-rises open up your eyelids
And realize, you’re a gift kid by finger usin
That some of the words, that I speak, nope I’m not abusin
Walk with me, lead the weak, not your everyday
politician but I’m slangin thoughts no cost to the boss
Just take what’s yours of course, our legacy was stole
Wu-alaikum salaam, from Mecca to Watts, and that’s how it goes

[ VERSE 1: Abdominal ]
Well hello and welcome
If you could wipe your feet on the doormat
Please, come in - oh Format...
We got company, where’s my manners, let me take your coats
I hope you’re hungry for some flavorful quotes
Which I whipped up myself, I’m really hopin that you like it
I call it the Abdominal Special, I eat a hype dish
Format? I think he’s still in the kitchen
Slavin over platters, you know, cooking rhythms
Come again? Oh, he said that the beats are finished
I guess all that’s left to do is just remix it
You say you wanna help, okay, how about you set the table
And what’s this, a beautiful patch cable, for me?
Really, you shouldn’t have
Please excuse me, I’ma just go and grab
A spare apron to keep your gear fresh
Format, where’s the food, it’s rude, we have guests

[ CHORUS: Abdominal ]
Dinner’s served, so yo, come and get it
Abdominal and Format cookin up the splendid
Concoctions, explosions of flavor
Check the ill culinary behaviour
You need seconds? Yo, come and get it
Abdominal and Format whippin up the splendid
Delicacies, explosions of flavor
Check the ill culinary behaviour

[ VERSE 2:  Abdominal ]
Okay, you’re right here, and if you could sit there
Format needs the chair closest to the kitchen
In case he needs to fix the snare
Which I’m sure will be crispy enough
Ah-ah-ah, we’re all hungry, but before we tuck
In and stuff our faces, we really must say graces
My turn, so here goes, Lord, thank you for bangin beats we lace
And of course the microphones that we rap into
Amen, that’s through, so let’s eat, pass the loops, bro
Soup? No, I said loops, so
Delicious with the fishes, nutritious
Servin roasted rapper, that’s the first dish on my wish list
Just gobble it up, then proceed to lick the plate clean
Taste the cuisine whipped up by the great team
Of culinary experts, Ab and a digit
Between 3 and 5 followed by a non-shiny finish
For-mat for the punchline-inept
Keep eating cause there’s tons of food left
Really, you just have to taste some home-cooked

[ CHORUS ]

( *DJ Format cuts up* )
(Actin ill) 
(Actin ill)
(Actin ill) 
(The behaviour)
(Actin ill) 
(Actin ill)
(Actin ill)
(Watch your behaviour)

[ VERSE 3: Abdominal ]
I got the feeling that everybody is ready for dessert to be served
But before I bring it out I got somethin to say first
Abdominal Junior, you will get nothing, young man
Until you finish those breaks on your plate
Cause all across the land there be starvin MC’s
Who’d be happy to rock to beats like these
You should be a little bit more considerate
And think of this before pushing your dish away without finishing it
And while I’m at it, get your elbows off the damn console
Really, where’s your manners?
I’m ashamed to have to scold you right in front of our guests
But you leave me no choice
I’m truly sorry that I had to raise my voice
But my son’s behaviour simply inexcusable
And if I don’t see some improvement soon, my fuse’ll blow
Is that clear, mister? Good, I’m glad we understand one another
Now go help your brother Little Format
Clear the table, put the leftovers in some Tupperware
So tomorrow we’ll have supper prepared
Oh what’s that, you say you must be leaving?
Such a pity, what a lovely evening
Well, thanks for coming, we must do it again sometime
I hope you ate enough - of our beats and rhymes

[ CHORUS ]

(Ill) (behaviour)

(This mornin for breakfast I had bacon, egg and chips
three cups of tea, a man to smack me lips
I said to John me husband, "Ain’t I gettin fat?"
He said, "Not really, love, I like ya like like that"
But he’s kiddin, you know?
Why do I got to be fat?
Why have I got to be fat?
And then for lunch I had...)

Mc’s "yes yes y’all"
Dj’s (scratch)
Writers (spraycans shaking)
B-boys make some noise

*Dj scratches*
"You may be asking yourself, how can your record teach me?"
"The essence"
"Let me tell you, that this moment, right now, 
can be the turning point in your life"

How many, stories must be told
Before the people know
It ain’t enough we owe
Plus makin’ speakers blow
Bass out 
To turn the whole place out
Kicks and snares, dance around the track
That’s laced how it should be
Could we, take you on a tour
To a place you probably never seen before
I mean it’s more to me then poor
Brothers cursin’, over beats at another person, more!
Then using our clothes to clean the floor, much more
Then vadalisin’ a wall, though it may seem to y’all
It’s all wortless
I testify with pride and provides a purpose
And outlet for the youth to express
Whatever they feel, is the truth
Now let’s see it’s me Yeshua da Po, with Dynamic Syncopation
Dropping you an invitation
"You are cordially invited to experience a natural phenomenon
the party’s on and will end well, who knows, 
dressed to impress doesn’t mean new clothes"
(styles, styles)
Styles, man it’s all it comes down to
You fine as ill, combined with skill your bound to
When cats with nothing but that surround you
A sound
You never heard throwin’ clever words around
To set a turbulent effect, throughout your dark process
Till it calls out next, an all out test
Of strength between, your mind body and soul
You find you can hardly control the rhyme from definin’ your role
And place on this face of this earth
I for one manifest through verse
But first
You gotta step inside, a fly universe (a fly universe)

Mc’s "yes yes y’all"
Dj’s (scratch)
Writers (spraycans shaking)
B-boys make some noise

It takes the breaks, concepts and skills
To create the great jams cats wait to feel
Some turn fake, and straight make a mill
Others like me, might be broke
But provoke
A real movement, improvement
On this artform, I was one of the few sent
To rock on tracks
Bringin’ it to you and yours 
In this purest form through raps, caps
Crossfaders perhaps
When breakers could take the time to make a statement
Fate sent me a sign the first time
I saw a crowd gather \xc3\x94round
To see the birth, of this brand new sound

Mc’s "now who’s down"
Dj’s (scratch)
Writers (spraycans shaking)
B-boys make some noise

Mc’s "one two, one two"
Dj’s (scratch)
Writers (spraycans shaking)
B-boys make some noise

[Hold On, Hold On, Hold On, Hold On]

This is a tribute, 
to the playas who get loot
And all my peoples out there on the street, tryin’ to eat
Make money, take money, that’s the hustla’s hymn
Got chu runnin’ thru these ghetto streets scuffin’ ur Tims
And it don’t stop,
til somebody calls the cops
When the ball drops
I’ma snatch all the props
For all my brotha’s in the struggle
Who learned to juggle
Jus be strong, and live long, you know I love you
Crime pays,
But we need to news ways to maintain
Cuz when I see you fall I feel the same pain
Like when they had you in the penile
You did ur time, ur free now
We bound to keep it real, until we old and senile
I got a fly scheme, to multiple my cream
Put a solider on my team, like my brother Raheem
will organize, a enterprise and represent one time
So my crew could succeed and my seeds will see sunshine
We came from nuttin’, they kept cuttin’ down my family tree
You’ll understand why, we don’t plan to die and strive to be free

Now hold on, hold on, hold on, my peoples hold on, hold on
Be strong
Hold on, my peoples hold on

Yo it’s all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it’s all in vain
It’s all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it’s all in vain
Now, hold on

This world got me stressed, though I know I’m blessed
I’ll probably feel safer wit the nine and a steel vest
I run wit the unafraid, who wanna get paid
by any means, even if it means, guns gettin’ sprayed
and drug raids, and other thugs laid to rest
He died trife, somebody told me life’s, a test
Some pass wit flyin’ colors, while others drop out
Some never got a chance, got knocked out
the box, and ghetto blocks, is trife
and we live by the knife
And die young, I’m hearin’ shots echo in the night
I can’t sleep tight, me, I was raised by the street life
Got me forever open, hopin’, that we never meet twice

Now hold on, hold on, hold on, my peoples hold on, hold on
Be strong
Hold on, my peoples hold on

Yo it’s all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it’s all in vain
It’s all the same, in the Hall of Fame
I just want to be ready when he calls my name
This material, world, is a ball and chain
Live your life righteous or it’s all in vain
Now, hold on

This is dedicated, to all the street corner hustlas
all my project peoples, the 85er’s, born survivors
To my brother, Raheem, still trapped up in The Belly, its time to come home
To all my peoples on lock, hold on, be strong,
To my pops, Malik, don’t let Harlem be your world
If ya lost lookin’ for light, jus know there’s a way out
This is for you, do whatcha gotta do
Jus hold on, be strong
Hold on

Hold on

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, pass the purpleish shit, man
Lex Diamond, hit that, hit that, hit that
Word up, this for my son, right here
Phil the Ag’, what up nigga
Yo, E, yo E, go do that for me, you heard?
West Coast style, huh, Ice Water ‘em out, you heard?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Phil the Agony, yeah, who got ya back?
Ice Water Inc., ya head?
Baby boy, 2004 shit, nigga, just forget it

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, I run every coast that I ran, I do a real nigga move
Make the young niggaz show me a plan
Guaranteed make all of them stand, like a hundred thousand
And better, the sweater that I rock is a grand
When you see me coming through your yard
I play the hood, with a real look, steel on my leg, in a van
Kill niggaz, pop they mans, stop they plans
Why, cuz Ice Water got it popping, that’s fam
We take it from here to here, anybody violate the system
That’s my word, a nigga gon’ hear
We rep Staten, plus all of the Latins in Los Angeles
And bad cracks up and hit Manhattan
Take it to a new level, all of us, Maybach bikes
Hit the circle, come through looking special
Shout out the team, yo Agony, you and your dogs
Keep them things on cocked and splash on ‘em

[Chorus 2X: DJ Khalil]
A thousand words to a picture
Will paint your reflection in a mirror
So you can see the trigger side clearer
West Coast, Cuban Link, down to my knees
With the best scope, weed to smoke, back on the street

[Chace Infinite]
We the ones that you running from
The ones pulling guns from under the polo knitted and make you fitted
Not finished, the real Chace Infinite, a passionate lyricist
Most rappers I hate, this nigga Rae was an influence
To build an indistructable frame, I excel, but entertain
I wish a nigga would, say my name, wish a nigga would play those games
Strong Arm Steady Gang, the illest niggaz on the mic from L.A
Phil burn a bag of the haze, and I’m having visions of CREAM airs
With the blue light, Marvin Gaye dripping
Chace is a visual spectacle, and see the raw clear through my cardiere
Spectacle frames, type of nigga that’ll twist my slang
With double meaning like, nigga I’mma about my chance
If you get it, then we kicking the same
I’m a poet, that paint black & white pictures in a colorful frame

[Chorus 2X]

[Phil the Agony]
Aiyo, back like I never left, rap like I’m back with the rest
Yup, with all of my niggaz, right on the steps
Cinematic view for the listeners, who paint pictures
Write scriptures, flip it on radio transisters
Listen up, get your bonds up, as far as us, we stay up to speed
Buckling up, whose fucking with us?
Immobilize your enterprise, stabilize all of your guys
Prepare yourself for two thousand and five
Live since ‘95, surviving, what we striving for, y’all
We got our families to feed plus we need more ends
They depending on us, the government is taxing us up
They see that I’m black, they want me in cuffs
Enough to make your nigga fall back, analyze
We on the front line, getting the good, keep the hood in mind
Design like, one of the best, architechts, building the net
Tell ‘em some shit, you’ll never forget

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: scratches by DJ Khalil]
"Strong Arm"
\t"Steady muthafucka"
"Strong Arm, Strong Arm"
\t"The shit that I’m repping is steady"
"Y’all not ready"

[Cougnut]
The bullet hit him in his back then came out his chest
This wouldn’t have happened if he left the house with his vest
I was rollin through this neighborhood known for drama
I wasn’t trippin cause I had to drop my partner’s momma
Off at her house deep into the crazy part
of the ‘jects where the funk and the drama start
Seen these marks who had beef about a year ago
Straight plexin bout a no good dirty ho
They seen my boy recognize us from the party right
Roll up hill in a bucket and straight open fire
Let a sucker straight duck but my Boone was hit
Bleedin bad from the chest I said "Aw shit"
I straight mash burnin rubber on the freeway bro
Strikin mad on the freeway straight to general
My bullet bad coughin blood up on the gurney G
They rushed him fast to the back straight to surgery
Got on the phone called up Fresh I said, "Hurry C"
Get to the hospital general emergency
Just then I seen the doc and he was smokin Kools
I said, "What’s up", he said, "Nut I got some bad news"
I started cryin, I had to shake my head
Because I knew, my dog was DEAD

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath {4x}
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit and tie"
He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit and tie"

[Cougnut]
I know who did it so I payed the little marks a visit
Old school Mob with my boys all four windows tinted
Caught ‘em slippin straight trippin on the late night
Fightin with his broad, trying to keep his game tight
Hit the corner with no headlights
Drinkin on a St. Ides, puffin on a blunt right
He seen the bucket started runnin cause he felt the funk
I hit the gas, caught that ass, put him in the trunk
Tied his ankles up with chains, for what it’s worth
Drug his ass by the public through the fucken turf
Let loose a clip in the air cause I didn’t care
People stare cause body parts is flying everywhere
I tried to lift his whole set with that Mac 11
And put every motherfucker on channel 7
But I cut from the drama but I’m not through
Here comes the boys in blue, plus the crew from channel 2
Askin questions bout the outlook of the fate
The chunk bodies and the boys with the yellow tape
But it was clean how we did it, so FUCK the task
Askin questions bout the suspects in the Jason mask
I had to do it to a fish my partner’s shameful death
He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit and tie"

(Phone ringing)

(Talking)
Hello (Hey, what’s up Nut, man is you alright)
Yeah man, I’ma make it man
But my family over here trippin man
(Aight, me and Supafly on the way to come swoop you up in the limo)

[Cougnut]
Time to go my boy swoop me in a limo
Louis and Rives bound to another funeral
Just last week I lost another damn close ace
This shit is crazy seems like I can’t leave this place
It was sad cause everybody was in a state of trauma
I felt bad as I cried with my partner’s momma
Reminiscin’ bout the times that we used to share
Bustin hoes everywhere now he’s outta there
It ain’t no joke when a brother get gunned down
Specially from a brother from the same town
I’m tryin to send my little message to express my rage
Instead of pickin up yo gauge turn the fucken page
And if you can’t tear it off till another day
And throw the dogs instead of pickin up that HK
We already out numbered by that other race
Slow your pace and stop workin for that penal face
Cause everytime you do a drive-by and shoot up bloods in
Later down your life they find it was your cousin
And that ain’t fly to watch your momma and your peoples cry
All you need to do is try and ask yourself why?
It might be you next layin in that box to rest
You took a breath and you knew you breathed your last breath

[Hook]
He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit and tie"

He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit in tie"

He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath {3x}

He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath {3x}
"Don’t ask me why, cause I’m down in a suit in tie"

He took a breath and he knew he’d breathed his last breath

[Intro]
Whats that whos this whats this man
aye right cunt (huh) S.O.S. (haha)
Who the fuck wanna (Werd)
Nae Cunt (uh)

[Werd]
You rappers fuck around you take after your ma
We are a fucker of a pair like a double D bra
Best in the game on the ball like Kaka
So you know I will blow like I follow Allah
They pick us like a damn guitar
To be in the space that you’re called a star
I’ll be blunt like the skin of a cigar
Like a bar tender a attend to my bars
Work on bars chin up cunt
You don’t want a fucking scar from the chin up cunt
Get called Tony
My doe fold like calzonis 
In my pocket with Es keys and pre-rollies
I aint no phony jabronie talking balonie homie
I clearly show ye some gory stories with your cronies
Sliced like pepperoni
Because for flows they owe me
Jesus Christ with a Knife
A make them holy

[Deeko]
I write song packing a punch harder than Tyson
Spits poisonous like the venom out of a python
Winking at your bird with a bitch under my right arm
So come on come on come on over here to get done
You don’t know me you probably never will
Go to clubs with a knife in my belt dressed to kill
(Looking sharp)
Giving me daggers fuck you man am giving you daggers
Pick one which one to enter your abdomen
You’re only half a man 
This shit is getting embarrassing
Punching the lights out of on transvestites
Immaculate mind
Compulsive theft a snatch what I find
Steal your watch give it to Werd
Just to pass the Time
Fucking hoodlum
About to blow up with my music like Muslims
On the 26 bus headed to Luton (Fucking hell)
The Al-Qaeda of rap will snap then
You’ll get bombarded with tracks
I will hi-jack your whole cipher

[Werd]
Aint you heard Werd funny like stitches
Stitches is witches get when I chib ye’s
Get a couple teams on cunts like grass pitches
And fuck a grass slash if he’s spraffin your business
My plan hit hitches 
Still hitting no riches
Spare change play pitchy not blew up strictly
Underground sound yeah Deek is still with me
Since we made with me 
Fuck that its history
Got sound like the Ministry and its full of misery
A have piff epiphanies so gifted in delivery
Mics am addicted to so fuck how you picture me
A leave a fool in disarray and tell them read a dictionary
A literally take liberties to cunts with stupidity
Indivisible most lyrically spit hot like high humidity
Like weather that you’re kidding me 
I flow on solar energy
Son shines so advanced we battle with telepathy

[Deeko]
Could kill a rapper with 8 bars
Show up at the funeral 
Read the eulogy just to finish him off
One of the last real rappers alive so don’t panic
While I’m hi-jacking you’re mind
Prepare you for crash landing
Sitting quiet when am speaking my mind
They can’t stand it
If my crew was ever part of a riot
Then I planed it
Don’t ever give me daggers I’ll give you a fucking sword
Push it into your temple until you one with the lord (get it)
My styles in your face the kind that can be ignored
I swore to never rhyme poor that’s something I cant afford
Sitting staring at the floorboards feeling board
Agitated trying to make this CD player record
Got a list of whack rappers who think they’ve got it locked
When am sitting backstage at shows ticking a box
Like that’s him Yeah him too 
He know he’s gonna get it
S.O.S. Deeko and Werd just so you don’t forget it

We live

We live

We live

We live

We live 

I dug deep down in my soul
Brought it back for rock ‘n roll
And those who live to rock

Went around the world to get it straight
About who’s number one, who’s second rate
For a few who live to rock

Jealous hoped we fall, but here we stand
We came back to take command
Cause we, we live to rock

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

You get in your car, gas to the floor
You’re the one who lets it roar
Cause you, you live to rock

You go to school, you carry a box
The teacher tells you you better stop
But you don’t, cause you live to rock

You go to the club, you’re under-aged
You sneak in back just to get onstage
Cause you, you live to rock

No matter what they say, don’t change your ways
Just rock with us all night and day
Cause we, we live to rock

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

We come off hard, cause that’s the style
Record it, put that on file
Cause we, we live to rock

They put us down every day of the year
Nevertheless we made it clear
That we, we live to rock

So when they get on your back about everything
Just open your mouth, just open your mouth - and sing

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We live to
Rock
Rock
Rock
Rock

[Mann Terror]
Ain’t no mistaken you see my chain you know who I’m with
Made niggas banging them hits, you banging them fist
With just a few good niggas, we can make this doe
And with a few good heaters, we can make some more
You only get something hot when you face the mob
Probably blow a whole job with Escobar
From the fiend up in NY that can’t be stiffed
Fucking with my dawgs only get you rained through quick
So much ice in my jewels I can be from Bedrock 
And I smoke that weed that put your brain in headlock
Wanna be a witness nigga you can witness this!
Four fevers straight to your wig splitting your shit 
Niggas hate you if you make it, so they pray you fail
Petty bitches run their mouth, Jake want you in jail
That’s the life of a Made Men, tighten the game plan
Come through and bomb things, we either hang men

(Chorus) Ray Benzino
It takes a few good niggas just to set it off
Watch your back, squeeze triggers then we let it off
We’re annoyed by the fact nigga’s telling too much
It’s a shame how these nigga’s always jelling in such 
You can’t handle the truth, the words that we speak
It’s time for us to separate the strong from the weak
Gangsta real shit from beginning to the end
(Nas to QB), Boston Made Men, (What?)

[Nas]
Fuck around lay around nigga

Yo as the blunt hangs low from my defiant lips
Smoke emerge in the shape of halo’s the chronic’s lit
My hoes are pornographic, flow’s orgasmic 
Doe stacking, strict as Joe Jackson training five kids to blow
Fraction of my mind died years ago, miserable drunk
Beers at most, swung at by school principal then I flunk
Peace to my foes who really took it dead with the beef
Peace to them hoes who left their pussy hairs in my teeth
I’ve proposed to the street corners, heat on us to clap the phony
Thug matrimony, champions like Shaq and Kobe 
Porno stars hoes like, Nairobi Knight wanna fuck us
It’s ruckus, water bed half the niggas can’t touch us
Seen it happen to the best, clap to their death
I tell you no lies, you ask me, no questions 
Look at my eyes, pupils are neutral
To the shit my body done, I shot lots of guns
.22’s, .45’s to none, to murder a Virgo
Spooky bitches try reading my chart 
I sleep with lights on, grown and scared of the dark
It’s not because of horror movies but the art of the beast
Sparking Uzi’s, rest in peace Barkin, it’s war in 2G
I wish my words could resurrect Ennis Cosby
I’d make Stevie or Ray Charles see the hate that bothers me
I feel like pulling out patches of my own hair
Said the words of my friend paralyzed in his wheelchair
It’s like...

(Chorus) Ray Benzino

[L.O.]
Born in a project hall next to a fiend smacked out
Plus my pops wasn’t around and my moms was cracked out
OG’s in my air trying to better my routes
Put me up on made niggas with major clout
A few of the best, nigga we’re the last ones left
From Boston to Queensbridge, better grab your vest
Don’t want these hot tests burning your flesh 
Jealous niggas hate us to death, gorgeous ladies giving us sex
Loving and living, bank rolls, sagging my denims 
D’s on our dick, rather see us locked in prison
Noisy neighbors look out their windows all in our business
My man ink spots the deceased, I’m trying to stay alive
These niggas always saying dead dawg, But whose dawg dies?
It’s me against the world, but I’ma hold my own
Work my way up, and soon enough I had a throne
Don’t get it twisted I’ma bastard but boy I’m grown
And only fuck with a few niggas

(Chorus) Ray Benzino

[Outro: Nas]
That’s right nigga, a few good niggas
No fake niggas, only real niggas making shit happen in 2000 baby
Nas and Made Men, I love to see my niggas get money
That shit makes me feel good; I love to see niggas get money
I love to see niggas get money
A few good niggas, that’s us

She got like stacks on the left, stacks on the right, thats pussy power you heard
You round this bitch telling your friends you know you will co-sign on her house
Get your credit get all swamped and shit, let the hoe use your name and all that kind of shit
Your motherfucking checkbook got her name on it, not your fucking name
That’s pussy power
All the Ladies say Pussyyyyyyy Power

Where everywhere I turn, I seen somebody gettin bust
Plus everywhere I look
All I could see is a crackhead or a goddamned crook
Runnin’ around with a pistol or a blade
Stickin’ up -- in other words, gettin’ paid
But I chose not to follow those ways
Cause the only place you headin’ is to jail or the grave
But on the other hand
I know a man named Stan
Who in the future had plans
To be successful on his quest to
Take his moms and pops out the ghetto
But that plan was soon to be crushed
When one day he realized he must
Get a better job to pay for his schoolin
While his friends would sit around just coolin
He applied for a job in the system
And everywhere he looked, everybody would diss him
He doesn’t have any type of skill
And life is not all games, it’s real
he took a long walk down the street
Tryin’ to think of a way to make his ends meet, huh
So he could buy the fly things he adored

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more

As he walked home, he thought to himself
Now what am I supposed to do to get wealth
He felt that his life was worthless
Then he ran into his man named Curtis
Now Curtis, he’s the type that stops and brags
About all the things he’s got
Drivin’ a Saab with a black ragtop
Come to find out Curt’s workin’ for the cops
He told Stan there’s a job that’s open
Makin’ it all sound good, just hopin he would take it
Yup, and like a big dummy
Stan said "Freak it, yo, I need the money"
Curt took Stan to meet his boss
Officer Sims, a sergeant on the force
He gave him a gun and Stan began
His new career as a damn hit man
his boss really liked his work
And gave the boot to his partner Curt
he didn’t realize what he was in for

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more

A few dollars more is what he started to make
Now he’s drivin’ around a Saab, with a house upstate
He got gold and diamond rings
Crazy girls and all those glamorous things
But one day this life-style end
When one afternoon while hangin’ with a friend
Sittin’ in the park, drinkin’ quarts of beer
And somebody said "Throw your hands in the air,
It’s a stick-up" and put the gun to his head
And said, "Make another move and you’re dead"
Now Stan had to make is choice
He paused and said I recognize that voice
Huh, where have I heard this
Now he remember, it’s his man named Curtis
Curtis is mad and felt he’d been robbed
"Cause Stan is drivin’ around in his Saab
He looked at Stan and said, "I can’t believe him,
Now its’ time for me to get even"
Stan made a move real quick
Curt jumped back and said, "Yo, that’s it"
Shot him in the back of his head with a nine
Reached in his pocket, grabbed his cash and then dashed
Now here lies the man on the side
The same way he lived was the same way he died
He never knew what he had in store

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more

[Hook - 2x]
Life is a struggle and pain, I can’t see the
Sunny days ‘fore the rain, G-O-D please
Help me to maintain, because I don’t
Wanna die, if I’m living in vein

[Cl’Che]
Sometimes I just wanna scream
But I know, G-O-D will make it right for me
When I feel like I can’t take no more, of these rugged streets
I let him take over, now my mind is free from worries
So many negatives, I can’t fall
Got my cheese, and Pac’s are posted on my wall
If I make any more mistakes, I can now learn from em all
Cause I’m grown now I found him, so you know I’m strong now
I write my songs, with plenty of pride
For my people, that done burned for years and died
Don’t you wanna grow over your child, so you can know who you are
Instead of putting the world on pause, just to drive that fancy car
Hey boy, I want you to feel me now
Cl’Che know you got it pain, won’t love you anyhow
Need you to help that little sister you know, build some esteem
You wanna know what’s on her mind, and not in her jeans
Let’s make this world a better place, for the living
Let’s make our minds a better place, for thinking and listening
My people, let’s try to make a change
Cause I don’t wanna die, if I’m living in vein

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Even with God in my life, it’s still hard in my life
Motherfuckers call it so close, to be fraud in my life
And I can’t understand, Z-Ro ain’t doing no wrong
That’s probably why they be fucking with me, thinking I’m all song
But it’s all gravy you wanna hate me, then go on hate me
Cause I’ve been looking for reasons, to take it off safety
And a motherfucker don’t make me for me, lay me feeling on me
Like nobody don’t really want me, the pressure creeping up on me
I wonder what happy is, cause I’ve never known it
People I meet ain’t partnas, they potential opponents
Cloudy days, and the place I come from running from cops
Put it down in the alley way, when they pass I’m busting some shots
Sorry God, I know I ain’t got no business selling dope and tripping God
Show me some inspiration, when you see me slipping God
Cause when I die, I don’t want it to be in vein
I’d rather serve in heaven, won’t be in the Penn in the flame

[Hook - 2x]

[Cl’Che]
Know you can go anywhere you wanna go
You can be, anything you wanna be
You can see, anything you wanna see
If you keep G-O-D, first everyday
And it hurts, the daily living while you flipping
Through your hood, with your partnas kicking
Click tripping, don’t know why he had a short living
You don’t know, yeah you know
He ain’t the first, oh how the truth hurts

[Z-Ro]
So I’ma go, where I wanna go
And if I’m pressing for a fo’, that’s what I’m gonna blow
Long as my bills paid and my rent paid, it’s all gravy
Cause when I was on this, ain’t nan one of my people saved me
Life is a struggle and a pain, but I’m maintaining
I pray I won’t get found naked, with my brains hanging
Too many niggaz, trying to get me for my paper stack
So I’ma be bout a playa, now where the haters at

[Hook - 2x]

Interview, interlude in the nude with my boo thang
Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
I swear he love me
My tummy almost got ready
For biddi-baby spaghetti
And teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile
Before you leave, don’t look down
God will help you spread your wings

My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey

Ask me why she said goodbye
Why baby dyin’ white walls
Cigarette’s over skyfall
Writing this life, this my song
Ask me why she hesitated
Almost waited, waiting room
Play date up to heaven soon
Soon I will see the King
He reminds me
Some give presents before they’re even ready
I could see that she loves me
I know her heart is heavy

Telefone-ication nation
Baby help me testify
Oooh you know I hate goodbye
Bye bye blue
Somebody let the yellow end
Bye bye blue
I’m gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
You my baby, you my baby
I’m your baby, I’m your baby
You my baby, you my baby
I’m your baby, I’m your baby
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
I’m gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us

[Verse One: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
I’ve been knee deep in trouble, trying to stay afloat 
Pressure, pressure, noose ‘round the throat
Quick storm comin, you better stay indoors
Secrets, secrets, buried in the floor
Oh baby wants a new life, that’s what she might get
Pressure, pressure, a noose ‘round my neck
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn, to love you

[Verse Two: Pete Lawrie Winfield]
There\xc2\x92s a riot in the town, a wolf at the door
Pressure, pressure, poison at the core
Quick storm coming, God save the queen
...Wake up from your dream
There’s a riot in the town, smoke in your lungs
Pressure, pressure, blocking out the sun
Send me down a rope, lost out to sea
Trouble now coming, coming for me

[Chorus]

[Rap Verse: Mr. MFN eXquire]
My life flash before my eyes, it’s like a sequence in a dream
I died to darkness and got swallowed and devoured by a big white light 
It smothered me, staring at my face while they covered me
My soul left my body, now I’m hovering, over me
Thinkin ‘bout my wrongs, my rights, my ups, my downs, my left, my right
Decisions that I made and games I played, wish I could played them twice
An angel came, took me by my hand to the pearly gates
and placed me on the scale, where they weigh your soul for hell
Suddenly I fell rapidly, the heat of fire, smellin brimstone
As demons dance surrounding molten lava
Ghouls and goblins, waitin for my soul to drop 
But the moment I was s’posed to hit the ground is when I got up
Damn, bad dream... {*exhales*}

[Chorus]

[Intro: Usher]
Yeah! What you say? Let me see it!

Pretty face and she got the fattest culo
Kissin all on me, pinchin all on me
Touch a lil\xc2\x92 paper start switchin all on me

It is what it is and it isn’t what it was and what it ain’t
Is another dime a dozen I don’t coven I create
When there’s nothin’ in my cupboard I be guzzlin’ V-8
I’m concerned by how the government and governor behave
I’m fed up with all the rubbish that the youngins emulate 
Yesterday I cuddled with a couple of Malasians 
Play me in the summer with a cup of lemonade
I don’t knuckle up but on a couple of occasions
Hate when undercovers run amok at the parade
Homie I grew up without a butler and a maid
Homies get a cut of every buck I’ll ever make
Since my rubber ducky I’ve been lucky with the dames
Ever though I’m never up to spend a ducket on a date
If you’re luckin’ for a sucker keep your number and your name

I don’t give a motherfuck where you reppin’ about your weapons and your cash
Motherfucker you can blow it out the rectum of your ass
Drop me off in any sector, any section of the map
In about a second I’ll successfully adapt
Every second’s millisecond I be workin’ on my craft
I be runnin’ rap but I will never catch a cramp
Because before I make a record I be stretchin’ out my calves
And I could never write graf
But I could always write raps
I think about the days when chicks was walkin’ right past
But now they call me right back
So I suggest you go ahead and wave your white flag
And brush your teeth and fight plaque
And since you never know what a woman might have
Keep a jimmy hat

Cause you don’t wanna catch crabs
My alliances with lions are lines on the left
When it comes to science we the brightest and the best
When we step up in the party, the party commence
Any time we rock a party watch for cardiac arrest
When your party’s so lethargic, you need an EMS
Hit my Motorola I’ll be over in a jif
As a whippersnapper I was known to shoot the five
And I wind up in the principles where I would plead the fifth
Chicks not into gettin’ physical simply do not exist

I hold it down

[Outro]
Ummm...Yo, there is no spoon. There is no spoon. Peace

[Verse 1: PC]
A simple bite of a fruit against the face of destruction
Led to milleniums of pestilence famine and destruction
Seduction of the flesh quickly robbed us of peace
A power trip let power slip to embrace the face of the deep
Now if you peep that brief view of history then you’ll know
The story of the fall of man and I hope you’ve learn alot mo
Because the road thats lest traveled is a tedious one
Must sacrifice clever devices and the secular fun
Because to end the war in Heaven He’s proved He’s second to none
And even went so far as to deliver his Son
Into the hand of the enemy a plan for cleansing the
Entire earth even while we were s-i-n-n-i-n-g
But yet we blame society for insobriety
Am I the only one knowing the truth that Jesus only died for me?
Naw the ultimate propitiation
To die with humiliation himself to sanctify every nation
And thats real

[Chorus]
Saved by one [I am saved by one]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son, Yeah Jesus]
Saved by one [I’m saved by one only one, Jesus]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son]

[Verse 2: PC]
I thank Jesus just for walking again and talking again
The love he shows me be the reason that I call him my friend
Demons on all sides Satan just’a haulin em in
Father protect me and just catch me from falling in sin
You’re my reconciliation when I’m gone in the wind
Your very doctrine never stops being the one I depend on when I’m in a jam or the evil presence of men
Righteously gifted me like Christ when baptized by his kin
Saved by one the Son to be enslaved by none
More than a conqueror over Hell death and the grave I’ve won
Crucified with him just look at what the Lord has done
Took the shackles off of a jackal so that I’d become his son
Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven
In all my days I could never do what You did in seven
Or even greater what You did in three
Hung bled and died for me my Lord You set me free
How could it be

[Chorus]
Saved by one [Ohhhh yes]
Thanks to your only son [Thank you for saving my soul]
Saved by one [Because of your blood, I’m set free]
Thanks to your only son [Yes i am, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah]

[Verse 3: Big Beem]
Over two thousand years ago a Savior was born
He was adorned with oils and spices but prophesied to mourn
He loved us with open arms but He was beatened and torn
He was crucified despised rejected and scorned
As a youth He grew in wisdom by confounding the wise
Bringing sight to religious leaders by opening eyes
He was one with the Father manifestation of Truth
The Word was made flesh and the kingdom was loosed

(Mo Stylez)
Oh Lord You coming again the soul lover of men
The Lord of Lords and King of Kings when we were loving our sin
You humbled Yo’self and came in the form of the Son
To sacrifice Yo life and do what the flesh couldn’t be done
Dear Lord I thank you that You took our place we saved by grace on earth
1 sin had us under a curse
Yo faithfulness led us into this dispensation of grace
To see us seated with you up in a heavenly place
We give thanks

[Chorus]
Saved by one [I am saved by one]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son, Yeah, Jesus]
I am saved by one [I am saved by one, Only one, Jesus]
Thanks to your only son [Thanks to your only son]

[Spoken]
For God so loved the world
That he gave his only begotten Son
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish
But hath everlasting life

[Sung]
For God sent not his Son to condemn the world
But that through him, The world might be saved
Now being justified by his blood
We shall be saved [By the blood]
We shall be saved from wrath [By the blood]
Through the blood of Jesus [By the blood]
For if the father shed not his blood, There is no remission [By the blood]
[I’m saved] Cause i’m saved by the blood [By the blood]
I’m saved by the blood [I’m saved] [By the blood]
I’m saved by the blood [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Ohhhhhh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah [I’m Saved] [By the blood]
Oh, Jesus [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Oh, I’m saved [I’m saved] [By the blood]
I’m saved by the blood [I’m saved] [By the blood]
What can wash away my sins? [I’m saved] [By the blood]
What can make me whole again? [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Nothing but the blood [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Nothing but the blood [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh [I’m saved] [By the blood] [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Yeah, I’m saved [I’m saved] [By the blood]
I’m saaaved [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Jesus wins [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Jesus wins at Calvary [I’m saved] [By the blood]
To save a wretch like you and me [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Oh, By his blood, Yes he diiiiiiiid [I’m saved] [By the blood]
I’m saaaaved, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Thank you Jesus [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Oh, All of my sickness [I’m saved] [By the blood]
All of my suffering [I’m saved] [By the blood]
The same is washed away [I’m saved] [By the blood]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh [I’m saved] [By the blood]

[Woodie]
It’s that W-E-S-T, T-W-O-M-P
Represent and I’ll pretend
That W double O-D-I-E
That took the Y-O-C up out of East Co. Co.
And let it be known
That there’s some major shit
Crakin’ off in the deep East Bay and G’s roll
From block to block with automatic chops,
Removable stocks, and extra clips
And mob shots pushin’ crank bombs
And yet these bottles make all of us flip
I never did much slangin’ for bangin’ pursuited hard
Why the fuck you think they always keepin’ norte\xc3\xb1os off the yard
Cuz we smash on the enemy
Northern Cal is our vicinity
Tryin’ to run shit on our side of the map
Get blown back with artillery
It’s a known fact we’re rivaled by many
But that don’t mean a thang
A little more quantity
But a higher quality’s got to keep domain
So when we gather our troops
To rowdy your boots
Don’t be shot cuz I warned ya
Come to the topside of California
See northsiders on every corner
Throwin’ up that mighty N-A
Packin’ heat, holdin’ a fort down
And if you disagree your out of pocket
Comin’ up short now

Chorus: [Woodie]
All who wear them bloody rags hang
Larks and cutty’s back swang
Mind your own and do your thang
If you don’t wanna gangbang
But if you get the set trippin’
And that south come out your mouth
Or you disrespectin’ north
Than bet your death will come about
All who wear them bloody rags hang
Larks and cutty’s back swang
Baller’s rap the fat chains
And the money stacks claim
Different lies everyday
Police always on the way
But hey
That’s how we live in the bay

[Lil’ Los]
If you can’t stand the heat
Then get the fuck out the kitchen
Cuz ammunition that I’m dishin’
Best believe it ain’t missin’
The clock is tickin’
I’m trippin’
The steel that I’m grippin’s askin me
How the fuck I got myself in this position
It’s easy the town I’m in gave me a complex
They gots me snappin’ and flashin’
Over some nonsense
So buckle up
And keep your chest covered up
I’ll grab my clip, stuff it up
Now it’s time to fuck shit up
And times are tough
But their only gonna get tougher
My barrels payin’ thunder
Leavin’ suckas smothered for colors
I’m comin’ out the gutters with cutters
That be cuttin’ muthafuckas in my way
In the bay
In that game where you don’t play
And it’s too late
You clocked in
Now there ain’t no stoppin’
Choppers from choppin’
When you make it to my top ten
I’m lost in the zone goin’ crazy
Good, I’ll shake it
There ain’t nothin’ that can save me
From the way the streets raised me

[Chorus]

[Woodie]
Death could come at any moment
I’ve been walkin’ there for years
Since I swallowed all my fears
And started holdin’ back my tears
It seems the only way to keep my heart pumpin’
Now is to represent
And keep the names alive
Of the those homies already dead
And when I know I ain’t evil
But it’s evident I ain’t heaven sent
How could I be when I done committed
Each of the deadly seven sins
A product of my environment
That’s bullshit I ain’t buyin’ it
Been a killa since birth
It’s in my blood
There’s no denying it
We got our own constitution
Northerners organized
And believe it or not
This love amongst us
All sometimes disguised
Tried to hold a job
A couple of times
But fuck a nine to five
Suckas tellin’ me what to do
I’d rather be shot and buried alive
Just let me ride
Let me kick it
Drink my 40’s
I admit it
I’m addicted
I can’t get enough
To shake it out my system
And my fellow homies feel the same
And out the trenches of the bay
Takin’ it day by day
One step at a time
Closer to our grave

[Chorus] 2x

[Chorus: Jesse West (True Love Everlasting)]
What’s your name, son? (I’m True Love Everlasting)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m God)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[True Love Everlasting]
Now the Gods walk the streets, the same as the next man
We say "Peace", and give niggas pound and spark land
We see the overall picture, and rush to make plans
While you put your life right, into the next man hand
Survival of the fittest, mad ghetto, hard hitters
New York City’s finest, greatest rhyme spitters
When it come to this game of life, they all beginning
Playing in the game of death, they all winners
Them niggas start selling they ass to eat dinners
They don’t care, they going all out, they all sinners
I guess they said ‘fuck it’, once the Devil jumped in us
We can let his ass do what he want, until he finished
The Gods give us gas to, when we have to
But we don’t put that, on every track, that we rap to
We could still build and spark L’s, when we come back, dude
But if you sling shots, we sling ‘em right back at you

[Chorus: Jesse West (RZA)]
What’s your name, son? (Eighteen, Twenty-six, One)
Are you a thug or a God? (God Cypher Divine)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[RZA]
Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah, never reneggin’
Don’t fuck with the dead pigeons or pigskin
You fuckin’ fake, 85 percent snake
Derelict ass bitch, you dead weight
Ain’t no fire escape in hell, every devil ain’t pale
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds"
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I’m hurlin’ ya’ll
Lightin’ bolts, by writin’ quotes
Strikin’ jolts that frightenin’ adults
From A to Zig-Zag, you get smacked, bitch, thrown into a shitbag
Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some fake thug
Drunk from the drink and gassed up by the drug
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis
While the Gods rebuildin’ Jerusalem, living inside golden palaces

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son? (Jess West from the beam)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m G-O-D, son)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so (true that)
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[Jesse West]
Now when I drop degrees, 85 percent freeze
I bomb ‘em with no problem, when they ease up
I squeeze off, I represent for O.G.’s
Who lay up in the cut, save that, roll trees
Used to flip bricks, and shit, sold d’s
Did a bid, came home, switched my whole steeze
I’m only in the game, to win more cheese
And you thugs who ain’t show me no love, can hold these
My game Trump tight like Biggie and Lil’ Cease
I reign on MC’s like Wu-Tang Killa Beez
I got peeps that hold heaters, cuz they need that
And ain’t scared to roll either, thinking something sweeter
Cats roll up, they say West, is you the hardest?
I say "Do Method Man know where the buddha spot is?"
Do 24/7 get paid regardless?
They try hard but couldn’t stop it, when we dropped this

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son?
Are you a thug or a God?
Peace, son
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

(Talking)
Uh, Hahaha, Uh,
Only I can get away with somethin like this
Yall know my name

I’m an uptown boy with Soho flava
Da beat is D minor but I’m oh so major
I do my own thing so I owe no favors
Can’t do it now then I wont go it later
Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce
But it’s gravy so boy get lost
Nah I ain’t cocky I’m just statin the obvious
H.O. the boss and I’m makin his pockets rich
Hate it or not I am great and about to get greater
Hit the Peja like I play with Stojakovic
I keep it real and my ladies do the same
High class chicks that be crazy in the brain
Style so mean, swag is vicious
Smile O.D, ass delicious
Stay gettin money no need for e-bay
My heart is all da world but I’m lovin BK

(Chorus)
I ain’t got no problem wit girls out in Harlem but
(They ain’t nothin like a Brooklyn girl)
See I had a dope fling wit a girl on queens but
(They ain’t nuttin like a Brooklyn girl)
The Bronx is live that’s where my mom resides but
(They ain’t nuttin like a Brooklyn girl)
(Damn sure aint nuttin like a Brooklyn girl)
(D-Damn sure aint nuttin like a Brooklyn girl)

My girl Angie can’t be a groupie or whore
She bout gettin money in her juicy couture
Do she get bored with the Gucci of course
So the Louis she sports til it aint new anymore
Then she cop another one makin hoes gettin madder
Gettin more money so the price don’t matter
Ain’t seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter
And if you think she bad then her friends are way badder
Kendra’s a Christian never seen freakin
In church every weekend she need to be deacon
Had a model bitch name Viva we aint speakin
But I had her screamin whenever I was beatin
She been callin, creepin, crawlin
Maybe she would chill if I would beat it often
And Ronesha’s fly and she sweeter than Splenda
Cause no one ever slows her agenda

(Chorus)

As we smoke da la la la
BK gettin money no 9-5
Mamase mamasa mamakusa
It don’t make sense but admit it, it’s kinda hot
BK girls down wit that ride or die
So I always keep one right by my side
See I love New York I aint gotta lie
So if you messin wit my ladies it’s homicide
I gotta friend named Shayna
She like Bill Bellamy and how to be a player
Shorty is a player can’t nobody play her
Can’t nobody game her cause she aint a gamer
Baby girl ballin kinda like the Lakers
If you would trade her like Shaq then see ya later
Player she do it so easy it’s kinda like a layup
She could lay up wit your boy wit no make up
Keep doin her and imma keep doin me
Even on the road imma keep 2 or 3
Bad BK chicks that speak fluently
In the Hamilton language girl speak to me please
I remember when I couldn’t get a girl for shit
Now I can’t get rid of any girl for shit
So when they look at me I don’t look away
I spread love it’s the Brooklyn way
Now let the hook play

(Chorus)

I’m the ace of chase when it comes to the trace
of that sweet pink hoof, like it right in my face
You know I’m money when it come to the honeys
I get so much chicken that it ain’t even funny

Trackin’ the trim, sackin’ the quim
I’ll tag your girl if you ain’t watchin’ her, Jim
If she looks like a sinner, I’ll buy the bitch dinner
No later than midnight I’ll be pouch deep in her

Give me a little sum’m sum’m
The ladies are satisfied when I hump ‘em
They give me what I need and then I dump ‘em
Baby, let me have a little sum’m sum’m

The booty can’t hide when I’m out in my ride
Any cooz I pick up always lets me inside
Like it tight, that’s right, I can go all night
I don’t give a fuck if they’re stupid or bright

My favorite kind likes it in their behind
It hurts ‘em at first, but then they dig it and grind
I start fuckin’ faster, make her call me master
I pry her mouth open and then I blast her

Give me a little sum’m sum’m
The ladies are satisfied when I hump ‘em
They give me what I need and then I dump ‘em
Baby, let me score a little sum’m sum’m

Cruisin’ the malls, a yearnin’ in my balls
I’m famous for scorin’ in the bathroom stalls
Whenever I want ‘em I always get on ‘em
A cold day in hell’s when I’ll use a condom

I found me a chick who’s all over my stick
I pulled her aside and then I nailed that trick
Ten minutes of bliss but now it hurts when I piss
The doctor diagnosed me with syphilis

Caught me a little sum’m sum’m
Pain in my testicles when I bump ‘em
I don’t look at bitches now ‘cause I can’t hump ‘em
Doctor, please prescribe a little sum’m sum’m

Yeah, nineteen ninety-three
Uh-huh (UM-UMC)
Bring it

And be the grand wizard lyricist, Kim UMC

And yo I can’t be undersold and, my word as good as gold
I won’t fold under pressure when your girl let me undress her

Gave myself a future career from the days of Blue Cheese

First and foremost, the major shout to the mighty UMC crew
I wanna say whassup to my peoples Ruckus
I wanna give a massive shout to three-two-one
I wanna say whassup to my peoples Cold Crush
All the way down to Ill Breed
I wanna say whassup to my Oran B
And Cool Craig is in the house
Staten Isle’s in the house
Staten Island comes first everytime
Brooklyn’s in the house
Queens is in the house
Uptown’s in the house
Bronx is in the house
I wanna say whassup to Long Island kid
Yeah, UMC’s forever, always, we out

Was it the fact we come from the same womb
Got the same ears but we ain’t singing the same tune
Half my life I saw you as a role model
Used to know my pops, said he always drank them whole bottles
Maybe at times you saw his face when you looked at mine
And I was too young to recognize a troubled mind
But now it’s all so clear
We share the same blood and in a way we share the same fears
But I was never like you
I kept telling myself evil is unlike you
Until I had a dream where you told me I should watch out
Then I woke up and everything blocked out

Guess we’re turning tables and walking out
(Walking out, walking out)
Gotta act like I don’t know you now
(Know you now, tables turning)
This is for the homie that let me down
(Let me down, let me down)
Hope I don’t see you around
(See you around, tables turning)

Shit I can never tell if this was a test
You might as well kissed me on the cheek and stab me in the chest
And I will shake your hand, we’re made from the same sand
I can try to, but I will never understand God’s plan
We are not the same
And I could never wish you dead but I wish you the same pain that runs
Through my veins
I thought I had you all figured out
And always assumed that we were walking the same route
Never had a doubt, my heart kept bleeding and it still do
All it took for me was to catch a glimpse of the real you
Wish I could heal you but it hurts me to say
The hurt and the pain is the reason why I’m turning away

Guess we’re turning tables and walking out
(Walking out, walking out)
Gotta act like I don’t know you now
(Know you now, tables turning)
This is for the homie that let me down
(Let me down, let me down)
Hope I don’t see you around
(See you around, tables turning)

Guess I don’t know you no more
Guess you don’t know me no more

My rap defy injury
I set the standard of nice so high
Once i’m in heaven, 143,000 dead denied entry
Canopy candidly, Vakill single handedly amputated hip hop from humanity
Til every emcees a stan fan of me
Let the world can sleep and it’s curtains for the canopy
Everytime light bulbs pop over my head
The roaches running across the dark halls of my sanity so
You stuck with two options
You can swallow your pride and hand me dap or watch your family clap
Competitions like parking spots, good one’s hard to find
Everything else is handicapped homey
He vice versa, i’m a nice verser
They only good for one nice line in every verse they invent
Liver ran through my saliva glands 
With the sole purpose of turning every hood to ash like the first day of lent
The earth comatose last time the king viewed it
Bring units when mandible sling fluid
Y’all can’t be serious
Vakill’t like columbians sittin in a serpent
My name has a dope ring to it
My range one step toward tomorrow
A new world order, miter or flower
Spit harder than a boxer with piss in his water bottle
The second coming with a sperm count so high
Girls grab a tube before they swallow

Hook 2x
The end of the beginning is kill
Dominion is mine, the world don’t stop spinning until
Who should oppose, i’m bendin’ his will
Put ten in his grill, it’s not a game, the ending is real

Some emcees I should have been blazed by now
Talkin’ that front page murder
You couldn’t make head last with raised eyebrows
Traditional hip hop is beatin’ a dead horse
One more posted on the internet
Tilt your bed forwards, head when I send a threat
Cause hell hath no fury strick his mind
Got disillusioned statements a hypocrisy of the sickest cat
In this life, sad makers on strike
While holdin’ them shit stuffin picket lines
Not everything that’s abstract is comin’ from out the woodwork of skill
Or the circa skill
The underground circuits a circus field with bodies i’ma leave hangin from trees
Like blair witch stick figures in burketts field
I’m above niggas with affinity, I spit the trinity
So you up against trio odds and losin’ in a godormous cleo cards
The sickest emcees is beneath me
Snappin’ under my nuts like leotards
I’m vy hyphen violentist, pen a ma’am and a violinist
With straight razors at your trachea
Half postal worker, half terrabus anthrax biochemist
I’m the sickest pushin the envelope please
Born nice, i’m Dionysis, dyin’ nicest lack
I keep a head full of ass in a wine cooler
Most portable line ruler in a class by myself
Like a bitched up two Manhattan to Columbine shooters

Hook 4x

It\xc2\x92s that G street shit nigga you know what I\xc2\x92m talkin about
come on
Southside, niggas make that money
Make that ah ah
Northside, niggas make that money
Make that hah
Eastside niggas make that money
Make that ah ah
Westside niggas make that money
Make that
Live life in legacy is my destiny  nigga fo sho
You know I\xc2\x92d rather take it slow doe
Hoppin out the four door
Ride
Dramatized off in this game but it ain\xc2\x92t no disrespecting myself
So it ain\xc2\x92t no disrespectin my game
Can you hear me meng?
Better watch where ya walkin if you talkin that shit
Especially if you counterfeit
Fuck around and get your wig split
Tryna dig shit
But really I ain\xc2\x92t no murderer
But hear me when I say
Nigga I ain\xc2\x92t never heard of ya
Full of that weed

So you know I ain\xc2\x92t no jive
Nigga that\xc2\x92s my mentality
Whut
Don\xc2\x92t catch no casualty
Nigga cause in reality

Nigga I\xc2\x92m from a town called fresh
Off your motherfuckin ass
Steady mobbin to the gunblast
Take a turn in my way
See me playin wit my A.K.
And smokin on some hay on Valentine\xc2\x92s Day
Nigga hah hear me say whut
(Chorus)
See me ridin cool as glide
With my thang right by my side
Suggesting ya\xc2\x92ll put down your pride
Cause only playa hatas die
And ain\xc2\x92t no love for the other side
So ain\xc2\x92t no way I\xc2\x92ma let it ride
I-oh I oh I
( x2)
Nigga come get some bump and put yo mug on and bitch meng
Playa hatas gonna get served when I put my gloves on now get right
When you interfere in my zone get caught up in a rapture
You can\xc2\x92t capture the kick crime bones and slap it ask hops

Traveling through the hearts of men
I can see all the sin we in
Some of ya\xc2\x92l gonna pretend
To the end and back again
So it ain\xc2\x92t no friends
Hey now
That\xc2\x92s why I don\xc2\x92t play nah
You gonna hear a nigga say hah
Give a fuck about none of ya\xc2\x92ll
Give a fuck about one time
That\xc2\x92s why I stay high till I die
Steady countin my fetti
Little nigga nuts to finally got heaven
See me walkin wit a cowgirl don\xc2\x92t know down to eleven
To the back of a chevy
Ready or not here I come
So can I be the chosen one
Noddin like a poppa don
Click gettin ready to drop the bomb
Booya bam you were here me say damn
Steady walkin and talkin in the silence of the lambs
And I cram to understand
With a pistol in hand
Impress another killin clan
Tryna figure how a nigga just could kill a man
Maybe cause he ain\xc2\x92t feel the man
My niggas got me trippin off the shit they play in my head
Fatal visions of that infrared
Nigga crucified on the cross
In the land of the lost
And resurrected
On the day they made me boss in this motherfucker
(Chorus)
God bless the child that hold his own on the microphone
Home alone and name is Corleone
Tryna get it before its gone
Hoppin in the cadillac broham
And I\xc2\x92m on in time
Feelin like the world is mine
Single handedly on the grime
Tryna stay away from one-time
Don\xc2\x92t mind but a gotta figure
All these years if I pull this trigger
With niggas chestin up like their nuts got bigger
Cause bitches still hollerin thugs and my niggas
Fore score about 24 years ago just a pimp ho
Momma told me how the game go
And it\xc2\x92s still the same skinny nigga lookin for the rainbow
To the top of the world if you ain\xc2\x92t afraid
Nigga let\xc2\x92s get paid
Hear me holler fuck em all
If they bitch made
Switchin like switch blade
Hey naw that\xc2\x92s why I don\xc2\x92t play now
You\xc2\x92ll hear a nigga say hah
Give a fuck about none a ya\xc2\x92ll
Give a fuck about one time
That\xc2\x92s why I stay high till I die
Come back again to the hearts of men no longer living in sin
Still smokin my weed sippin on a half pint of gin
With a devilish grin
JD\xc2\x92s revenge
In the lap of luxury
It ain\xc2\x92t no touchin me ho bitch
Fuck wit me
On a daily maybe
Bosses

We understand each other

We always usin rubber
She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That’s why she so down
Creepin so much
You would think we neighbors
She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn’t mean I’ma give her the go

[Hook]

She won’t roll with a player like you
She wanna roll with a player like me
She callin me cuz she’s in the need
Of a player like me that’s stackin G’s
Better bring it back, pull it back
Don’t be mad cuz your girl keep callin
23’s coop, she’s callin me cuz your boy is ballin
I know that she’s gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I’m not the man, we’re not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don’t understand
She’s callin me up when she leaves her job
That’s what’s up, when she leaves the club
Had too much she wanna cut, that’s what’s up

[Hook]

[Skillz]
You hear my phone ringing
She callin for a reason
No time for any teasin
This time what friends you bringin
Some say it’s a booty call
It might be new to ya’ll
Never trick my dawg
Never fuck ‘em low
Ya’ll already know what player she chose

[Play]
So, I pick her up round quarter to 8
Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Get cha hot cuz I know you can’t wait
Pretty face, but I give her her space
So we can do it nice and slow
I mean we can screw it nice and slow
Like Usher, I gotta confession
Call a player when you get this pleasure

[Hook]

Cig: Yeah man. My man Formz is gonna shut shit down man. Cig for life,
Ghostown. Yeah man, these coppers want me locked, they put cameras on my block,
and now I’m layin’ low cause the block is hot man.
J Formz: Yeah.
Cig: Yeah, they be sayin’ out in the street...

Cig: They be talkin’ man...They be sayin’...
J Formz: Tell ‘em...
Cig: F-O-R-M-Z, Ghostown! Yeah! Talk to ‘em Formz...
J Formz: Oh, I’mma tell ‘em

[J Formz]
Some say I’m crazy for sellin’ this fuckin’ weed
But it gave me more then enough money than I need
Cops love it when you broke, don’t wanna see you rich
That’s why they gon’ let a pussy go if he snitch
My sales was open to anybody who want trees
I Promise you it’s gon’ be some good shit, you’ll see
Here’s my number, you know how to get at me
I was convinced that the cops couldn’t catch me
I had that red haired, crystaled out chronic
Breakin’ it up left you with Sticky Fingaz like Onyx
Most of these dealers get ripped and skimp they bags
And they gettin’ screwed so they gotta rip they mans, they hurtin’
I understand I’m a target so I’m gon’ stop
But understand once I started I was on top
I’m not that stupid, I know the money is useless
Cause if I get caught, bail’s the only way I can use it, what!?

J Formz: Yeah, and that’s the truth. Ghostown! Gotta get out of here
shit is mad hot...

[L.E.G.A.C.Y - Intro]
Suicide, it’s a suicide, uh
Suicide, it’s a suicide, uh
Suicide, it’s the suicide

If I...put a Gillette to my wrist
If I, kill myself, who would really give a shit? - NOT ONE
I should kill myself with Pac’s gun 
That would mean somethin’ {*two gunshots*}
That’ll mean sum’hin
I’m done with this life, slice ‘til I’m done with this life
A bloody mess on my wrist ‘til I’m done with death
The Grim Reaper, at the front door, I greet ya
"Hey, how ya doin?" Wit a blade so soothin
Cut the varicose, me nd my family never close
That gives me more reason, just look at me bleedin
There’s red everywhere, pieces of L.E.G. everywhere
The puzzles scattered, can’t be put back together
FUCK YOU, BASTARDS! This’ll show you I’m clever
Start a trend of suicides like the movie Heathers
Tell Tracey I’m sorry, tell the baby I’m sorry
Just couldn’t keep up with all these people tryna keep us

[Chorus]
Nah...’cause I don’t have to stay here
Uh...
You can’t keep me ‘cause I don’t have to stay here
Nah...’cause I don’t have to stay here
Uh...
You can’t keep me ‘cause I don’t have to stay here

Here’s to whom it may concern, in hell I’ma burn
Remember that song, by B.I.G.?
"Suicidal Thoughts" Ready to D-I-E
You know that one part when he was like "I’m sick of talkin!"
Well right now, shit I’m sick of talkin
Wait, you still there? ‘Cause I hung up yet
(Hey, you still there?) ‘Cause the noose ain’t strung up yet
Hang myself, like my video or somethin
Cobain myself, got out wit a shotgun bustin
Milwaukee Buckshots, "L.E.G. blew his fuckin top"
It was the headline, what was goin through L.E.G.’s mind?
Possessed by the evil, and now what about his people
Grow tired of stress, the pressure, tired of debt
So self-execution was the only solution
It’s over, thoughts devily the stressin me
It’s over, ‘cause L.E.G.A.C.Y killed L.E.G.A.C.Y

People asking where I’ve been at
Had to see the world and put food where my fridge at
Tours all over the place, brother I did that
When I was a little cat, didn’t want a car
Used to look at skyscrapers like "that’s where I’ma live at"
I dreamed this, can you believe this?
It’s so surreal how I’m living my achievement
It’s 3 AM riding slow in my V6
Thinking why the hell it took so long to release shit?
Left turn, lanes start forming
Hit a red light as the rain started pouring
Open the sunroof, let the water come through
Leather getting wet, I don’t care, cause it’s just you
That’s what the mirror say, I could be gone tomorrow
But since I’m here today, you’re gonna hear me say
I’m changing, that ain’t really fun
Change is good, though, ask any bum
Ask Obama, that was his campaign
All I’ma do is give you my last name
I’m losing friends for pursuing my career
When the music ends, will they truly be here?
I do pretend if I’ll make it through the year
We can be cool again before a funeral appears
The beautifullest smear when the eulogy is near
Cause when they die, you talk them through the air
Annabel, I wish that you was here
I didn’t see you go, cause I knew it wasn’t fear
I go to church every week, looking stupid in the chair
Cause I’m taking enough space, I be waking up late
Walking in like I own that placing my faith in the grave
Next to you, I’m crazy like Mas-on Betha
Under mad pressure
Me and God ain’t talk, cause I’m scared of the lecture
Now my mom is happy I’m not bummy
I’m on, so I automatically got money
Now she attached to me, she’s stressing me out
Ayo, Jay this what success is about?
Wrestling doubt, call me Hulk Hogan with this dope flowing
They all hoping I’ll drop, but I don’t know owing
I got too much heart for the bypass
Can’t be touched, I ain’t a iPad
My feet talk to the concrete every morning
I run the streets, doing push-ups on every corner
They think I’m lazy cause my content got smaller
When I’ve gone farther than my father, why bother?
I was touring, recording and interviewing
But to my fans I was interluding
Typical long day, leave me alone, mang
Even right now, I’m invisible on AIM
Ducking people, tired of trusting people
Damn near had enough of people, vice versa
I felt like a funny-style groupie
Came to her, threw the word "love" around loosely
Four-letter verb had her strut around droopy
I fuck around usually, it’s nothing now to me
I shut it now truthfully cause
Cause I want a a wild cutie with a subtle round booty
But it’s something about beauty it lasts for a little bit
Cause if the chick dumb, not even good brain could fix the shit
Lately I want a baby, that’s crazy
Maybe I’m a three-legged chair, my thoughts shaky
So I get the box then I simply watch
Me pulling out quicker than a New York City cop
Deep shit, I don’t sleep, kid
Cause some of y’all think my word don’t mean shit
I put on these Y-3 kicks, cruise around 96
Straight with my leased whip
Looking at the skyscrapers
Upperwest-side chaser, you can’t stop my grind, player
Changed the cover of this mixtape
Almost changed the title but I can’t be rivalled
That’s that, scratch that, that’s Factz
Soon y’all gon’ be downloading the Black App
Me and my pops made up for his last act
I’m his Kid, but I don’t Play, I ain’t a Class Act
Team player, trying to win Steve Nash rap
If you don’t assist, then I’m past that
Got my eyes to the heavens watching birds skateboard
On the clouds, like the legend Tony Hawk when he skidding
Aiming for the top of the building while I’m living
I’ma get it; I’m moving on, I’m moving on
I did this, I did that, still doing more
Battered soul, what the fuck, I been through it all
When the things gonna change? Talk to me, y’all
Trying to get a skyscraper
Dying to get a skyscraper
Got both of my eyes on a skyscraper
I’ma get it, skyscraper

[Verse One]
You want truth then that’s what you’ll get
Milk it til it’s done and then tilt it to the side
Just to get the rest out
Come back with souls every time we conquest out
Bombed your house with actual facts from Messiah
Sent you a fax to match the patch from my tire
Made tracks, perhaps you’ll follow
The road to the cross
Take the crossroads if you feel hollow get filled up
More than a tank full
Meet Christ and end up truly thankful
From your heels up to the top of ya
Concealed the truth like a duce duce
Let loose while it Hasan chopped through ya
Had all that lip, you was straight big and bad
Til Christ touched ya hip, and left you zig-zag like Israel
You was stubborn and hard
Now you governed by God and all is well
Fishtail from turning too fast
180 or smash and burn into ash like
Crash dummies, instead of following Christ
You loved the pleasures of life and ice and cash money
Now that’s funny, no it’s not I’m sensitive
But God’s Son was sent to give us a chance to repen
To live and that don’t appeal to ya
How should I deal with ya
Knowing that God serves more soul food than Silvia’s

[Chorus]
In here, we got x-thugs in here
We got, x-crips, x-bloods in here
We got, x-pimps in here
We got x-x rated chicks in here
We got, nice guys, wise guys in here
We got, good girls, hood girls in here
We got, all types in here
That’s right, they hid in Christ they disappeared

[Verse Two]
Like EST and 3Xs Dope or Nas in these rhyme
We wrote we hope you meet the greatest man alive
And get caught up in His family ties
And that all y’all wise guys would come to have ya plans revised
Why wait to give God your life later
Before then you might slip and fall like a ice skater
You say Christ aint your type of flavor
He never claimed to be, He came to be your type of Savior
Cried for you, was tried for you
Buy unjust judges came here just to justify poor you
Died in your place
Two hand slam dunker, right and left punctured told death "in your face"
Took manikins, breathed life in them and revived man again
The champion of the camp we in
Told sin and death you can not win
Now rules on a throne with no known plans of vanishing
Hand to Him, all things before you wreck ‘em
Even small kings reject Him and they won’t play nice
So get ready for judgment day twice
First the church and then the whole earth
It’s time to pay the price
One group will pay Him and the others God will pay them
And the church all over the earth heard and said "amen"

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I’ve done enough dirt to make me dirty enough
To have to shower til clocks in eternity bust
Unworthy of trust, full of lust quick to cuss out
Turn my internal lights on
Nothing but darkness rushed out the light bulb
Til Christ called, asked me to follow Him
Cleaned up my act, lit up my path like a halogen
Gave me a new Father and showed me He was sovereign
Changed what my aim was, plus what I was hollering
Took away my old ways quicker than a dollar spends
Grabbed me by my collar and said "don’t even bother them"
But some of those ways stuck around I wallowed in
Sin that almost had me about to drown on the shallow end
He’s sandblasting me making me smooth as aloe
He said He wanted to reach Hip-hop and I said I’ll go in

[Chorus]

[Verse 1-Fashawn]
When I was young, I figured if I became a star
Maybe they wouldn’t seem as far
Maybe I wouldn’t dream as hard
Wanna stop, but all I hear is that applause
I’m addicted to the energy it causes
I wanna relive it every minute, that star
Know I’ma shine despite all of my hardships
I consider them lessons instead of losses
My old Nikes wouldn’t fit, so I tossed ‘em
They wasn’t fit for the fire I had to walk through
A lot of disappointments, a lot of promises
A lot of niggas fell off, they lack confidence
They had a dream but didn’t know how to conquer it
It’s not your accomplishments, it’s what’s inside of us
A star is a star and it shines regardless
of the money and the fame, it’s what’s in your heart
So many stars

[Chorus-Aloe Blacc]
So many stars, so many stars
Which one to choose, which way to go
Each one’s a song for me
So many stars to see
So many stars, so many stars
Which one to choose, which way to go
Each one’s a song for me
So many stars to see

[Verse 2-Fashawn]
Even if I reach the clouds, I’ll by flyer than ‘em all
See, the thing about stars, they shine, some even fall
So, you’re forced to watch ‘em, listen to ‘em in your car
Even at home on your screen, you can seem them from afar
I be nervous at times, admit I get butterflies
When the crowd yells "Ho!" it’s a natural high
Still after every show, I’m tryin’ to see at least a grand
Meltin’ mic stands from LA to Japan
Me and Ex on a mission, so respect intuition
Blessed with a vision, obsessed with writin’ lyrics
I guess, it was written in the sky like a scripture
Back in time, history, never said it was mine
Now we rackin’ up arenas, emceein’, kickin’ rhymes
Labels wanna give me some G’s, that’s just fine
A star is a star and it shines regardless
of the money and the fame, it’s what’s in your heart
So many stars

[Chorus-Aloe Blacc]

[Grouch]
Let’s do this March
We goin’ on a little march y’all
Put that right foot out

They call me the Grouch, at 6’1" that’s my height overall
Cuz that’s a light and yell complexion though my brain never stalls
Look for rain; I revolve around this planet like I own it
Developing my style, mother fucker don’t try to clone it
Yes, I hone it in my basement, you’re replacement is near
If you hold the mic too long you’ll get smeared like a queer
And I appear, like 39 go deep beneath the level, of the sea you seein’ me
So why are you yellin’ devil?
Man, I’ve been shovelin’ that shit for hella years and I’m no rebel
But I always speak my mind when over the bass and treble
Time to face the kettle that calls that pot black back
But that’s not the way to act
Then that’s not the way to react
We cap lyrically, affect you spiritually
Let the music do it to your soul on a whole

[Eligh]
I would like to know the reason why we
As an underground family always get the third degree
1000 watts of meat knocking MC’s right out of their seat
Marcher on the beat with crooked feet to the concrete
4:20 is sparked on the Dark Side of the Moon
Searching for the distortion so I slide through the saloon
Hoping to catch a train to escape this brainless yield
Take this stainless steel Army qualified shield to my chest
Armed to the "T" in armor, I be a city farmer
Plantin’ my seeds with a 2000 degree regulated hoe
Can’t be faded though by the sleet or the snow
My crops grow
Regardless of this system-eco
Keep my ego in check like a needle to the neck of a feeble balloon speck
Always on deck
My shit never gets out of proportion
I’m a doctor of abortions
For hollow lyrics born with no spirit
If this rhyme describes your rap content then I refuse to hear it
I’ll be on BB repeat
To have the media retreat
And take their seat in the fires
Heat, as we fire this fleet of hip-hop beats over oceans of space
Using weapons of bass to encase your skull
Like a glass box
I’ll be the last to jock and first to rock a show with a poet I respect
Not on Star Trek but I check my grounding
By evaluating all my immediate surroundings
I know you hated my dismount while you discount this pounding
It’s called cranial drowning
I’m the founding father of my survival
You can’t stop the arrival
So pop the cork when the stork drops them Grapes of Wrath
Don’t need to be up on calculus to calculate the math
So when my shit jocks I’ll make sure my shit rocks
Smokin’ that nuclear bomb I’ll die known as spinny-ox

[Grouch]
They call me the Grouch at 20/20 that’s my sight overall
My vision never fails, I prevail and watch you fall
Small people try to act as if they’re equal but they’re not
Always gabbin’ in your ear, offerin’ somethin’ they don’t got
But I can spot them in a crowd of many thousand from afar
I stay away from them, like women do my car, but are
We gonna be ourselves?  That’s truly the question
If I catch you frontin’ to me that’s the end of our session
Of bein’ friends; I’m seein’ men fallin’ deep into the cracks
So I’m peepin’ into raps so I can sleep, on my back
Between the sheets; call my fleet when I awake
Forever work on music and make the beat till I... break

[Intro: The Dream]
Yeah! (Yeah!) Yeah! (Yeah!)
A dope bitch! A dope bitch! A dope bitch! A dope bitch! 
A dope bitch! A dope bitch! Pusha! Push!
Hell yeahhhhhh!!! Pusha! Push!

[Verse One: The Dream]
Hoop earrings, she’s my favorite baby
Watch her do her thing, out here in the world
Body callin me, HUH! Like AT&T;
Haterproof, they ain’t got nothin on you
So fine, so hot, so cold (YEAHHHHH!!!!)
Beatiful, so bold, fo’ sho’ (YEAHHHHH!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!!)
Pretty lil’ thang, I’m glad, she’s mine 
And I mean no disrespect by this next line
Oh Oh!

[Chorus: The Dream]

One love from a thug nigga
Nigga Kadafi!

[Verse 1 - Yaki Kadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin’ up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin’ rules to these streets
Somethin I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
by young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit’s deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin’ my dough
So while you reminiscin’ all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I’m starin’ through your rear view

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can’t hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it’s time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

[Sting Sample]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on, Hold on

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
See you been gone my whole life, like a game a cee-lo
fulfilling your dreams on the streets like nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
and me and momma surviving depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
Narcotics is mastered, seen them niggaz you blasted
wanting me in a casket, on the grind I’m faster
Yea nigga I heard, lil’ moo gave me word
you get paroled on the 3rd,ill roll up we get served
We out here frontin, still don’t care about nothin
rollin in my double r and Im trying to see somethin’ we ain’t never had
came from a life of living, learn the tricks of the trade
shit shoulda been taught by dad
But learned through the crew, that’s just between me and you
and once we lock this shit down, ain’t a thing they can do
Meanwhile I’ll stay waiting by the phone
hoping I’ll get the call, telling a nigga that you home

[2Pac]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let’s get my enemies not knowin I’m comin back
Go get the money out the safe
It’s time to turn the streets into a war zone

[Chorus: 2Pac]
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can’t hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it’s time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly

[Sting Sample]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain’t no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I’m like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I’m livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I’m a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can’t hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it’s time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can’t hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it’s time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly

Life is to have fun, and life is to travel
Even old people cant stop looking at you
Come my love, come

Chi-Ali the lady stunner, I’m stunning the stunts
That’s blowing me kisses because I’m a Native Tounger
The native runner, and I’m about to blaze this flock track
Like Isaac, I leave ya in the Hayes
For days and days and days you try and phase
Yet you need to get Met, cause yo I heard it pays
Your pockets looks skimp, but yo there’s a bulge in my jeans
Cause I’m only 15 and ripping rap scenes
All the magazines say that cat’s hitting
But I feel like a rat getting chased by all the kittens
And all the coytoes setting up traps
But collapse on the faaaaabulous
No haps I design, a lined on the boom blue batter
Up next, me context a hex, from the complex
Rough, stuff, I puff, smoke, you wanna toke slow poke?
Nope, you can’t get nothing sporty
Your girl’s naughty, talking bout "Who’s shorty, who’s shorty?"
But get your girl cause I don’t wanna be the stunner
Just the runner, the funky Roadrunner

\tCool it coyote, I’m the roadrunner running things (Repeat 4x)

I shook up, honey ice tea
That’s domino a girl, I’m an O and a fly MC
From the, from the west
I’m fly from the east, peace to both, we know who’s best
Dip dip dip, I’m dipping landmines and pits
That coytoes set up to keep me from making hits
They want me to go pop but I’m a hip-hop the vote
So you know the only pop I’m popping is a soda
Never quote a Vanilla line when I wrote a
My mouth the trigger action and my brain’s a speed loader
And yo my pockets stay loaded
(Hey Chi, I heard you blew up)  Pssssh, exploded
But now my Redhead, a Kingpin Ed said
"Move It" The kid got skills, don’t belive me?
I’ll prove it, to all, from Tony to T and
My vision’s perfect, but if you smoke crack, I ain’t trying to see ya
The only thing I smoke are my mics
So take a hike and uuhhhhh, don’t sweat my Nikes
And don’t be sleeping on my statute, it’s no fact
I measure up to MC’s because my mic’s a protractor
And it may come as a shocker
I bumped around and got more styles than you’ll find at Foot Locker
So cool it coyote, cool it coyote
Or I’ll break a coyote, I hate a coyote
And if you’re coyote, I won’t hang with ya
Trying to trap off, or run off and bust a cap off, get the picture?
Hope so, cause I don’t wanna be the dunna
Just the runner, the funky roadrunner

\tCool it coyote, I’m the roadrunner running things (Repeat 8x)

I’m about to be but, but before I do
I gotta say what’s up to my crew
The Q, yeah, and on the check one, two
Is the Lemonader with Dres who said the choice is on you
So what’s up Doc? Butcher for the cut
And can I get a nut (What?) Chill, a Beatnut
This combination you can’t break, I’m hard to taste
So step to me and get cut up just like a steak
Yeah, I know that’s from one of my promos
But my rhymes roll on more tracks than a fat set of ???
Total Wreck, Sean Cato got ill skills
The Op Shop cannt drop so yo just chills nills
Girls say I’m cute as a button
Fly denim, my raps’ venom, I pin em
To, my trusty, my trusty old pad
No curses in these verses, respects due to mom and dad
Now tell me who’s the #1 son of
Oh you guessed it, it’s the funky roadrunner

\tCool it coyote, I’m the roadrunner running things (Repeat 8x)

\tCan you make him run? Well let me him run! (Repeat 4x)

Got subjects locked in my cerebral cortex
On Ampex tape I’m circulating like a vortex
Check out my techs that use a synonym as inspect
Mentally badgering emcees with my dialect
When I inject memory cell motors retrospect
To recollect; too genuine skills I resurrect
Directed live from the 2-1-2, 7-1-8, and 5-1-6 area
Throughout borough to borough, state to state, world thorough wide
I ride, driving mass tracks to genocide
Verbal defender, the brain infiltrator
Break and fracture a sucka emcee’s "structal" delegator
The pen and the pad and the microphone get blessed
With Nest, with ease now how I digress
Brothers are getting busy grabbing Teks while I apex
Verbal backshots coming without the latex
Watch the caption spin as the wax begin
How I’m rapping in to hit the backspin
Now end first verse in the blend
Herbalise to Resource done done it again

Chorus (2x)
One of the three the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state)
Borough to borough
NYC to worldwide rock thorough

See me and rhymes alike
Tooth to picks
Sides to kicks
Chops to sticks
Seas to sicks
Hard Mr. Bricks
Chest to Vicks
Corruption to politics
Sticks to stones
Stones to sticks
Not opposites flips
Cheese to cakes
Beefs to steaks
Bones to breaks
Decks to tapes
Good food to plates
Movies to dates
Cities to states
Odes to papes
Shaking MCs off their mics like earth to quakes
And now the hand of fate dealt me the higher intellect
Connect verbs, dissect words down to lecterns
W serves as the first repetition
H lines and curves take second position
A plays the third
The fourth brings the T
So hit two times so you get ummmmmmm
One of the three Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d

Chorus (2x)

My verbal attacks react to mental stimulation
I’m leaving gaping contusions caused by lyrical abrasion
No pausing, no waiting
I play the plus and starting to get in, shining like the sun
Lyrical patterns double up on the one
Like the name when expose the flame
I combust like aerosol or kerosene contained
Deaf ears turn the conversation severed
I set it off like Lateef and getting
Debted, forget it, it only happens because you let it
I move, swift tongue sliced crews beheaded
I said it again so let the repetition end
Resource and Herbaliser in the blend

Chorus (4x)

[Chorus: RZA]
I’ma deal with that, yo, you gon’ deal with that
Hey shorty, I’ma deal with that
Hey ma, I’mma deal with that
Bartender, we gon’ deal with that
Yo, homey, I’mma deal with that
Fuck that, yo, I be right back
Huh, yeah, I’ll be right back

[RZA]
Up in the spot, Bob Digi the fox
Bout to strip Red Riding Hood down to her socks
At the bar, yo, leave the ice on the rocks
Salt and lemon and Tequila shots
Eye to eye, I can see you’re hot
From glindin’ on the car, that the Visa got
The Benz logo and the keys I got
A hundred long stroke, for the police I squad
To leave my tongue at the G.S. spot
I may drop you off at the parking lot
When I die, I’mma free her knot
You may sniff by the hot pizza spot
Shorty, I’mma deal with the that
I got the Euro’s and the green back
Plus the Yen, give me the skin
I got enough for you and your friends

[Chorus: RZA]
Check it, I’mma deal with that
Bartender, I’mma deal with that
You wanna front, then I be right that
I might get my jack, rat-a-tat-tat-tat
And I’mma deal with that...

[Hook 4X: RZA]
Turn me up, louder, inside my ear, turn

[RZA]
Yo, I told ya’ll, I’ma be right back
You trying to front, why you be like that?
Now you run, when you see my gat
You get snuffed from Killa Beez in tact
Tall like the Eifel, I blast like a rifle
If you pretty princess, I might wife you
For one night, one flight
The paradise in the room, one light
Red rum, show me head love
And we can sleep, snug like bed bugs
And wake up, and break up
Hit the club next weekend and make up
And do it all over again
But this time, bring over a friend
Until we get sober again
Woof, there goes Rover again

[Chorus: RZA]
Can you deal with that?
I know, pretty mama, you can deal with that
Hope you can deal with that
Tell the bartender, I’mma deal with that
Tell, you can deal with that
Tell shorty wop, I’mma deal with that
You might have to feel my black
All in between your hot ass twat
And I’mma deal with that

Tick tick, blow up! Hiroshima!
Who am I? I’m that nigga!

[Verse 1: Timothy & (Theron)]
Look, real nigga, no faking, island boy but I ain’t Jamaican
In my hood, they flip work and then chop bricks like they half Asian
Gone jailin’, can’t save him, getting dough so the cops take him
Please tell them motherscunt to kick rocks and stop hating
All you ever been was a shoulda coulda woulda
Me, on the other hand, well I’s the girls dem sugar
Just me and my brother, hot like St. Thomas summer
All I wanted was a Beamer and to move out the gutter
The world is ours, Scarface, even though we came from a small place
No matter where I’m at, I’m VI, all day
The St. Thomas Kanye, need a feature? Call Ray
Ain’t stopping til everybody in the hood all say (Mayday!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Theron]
Bad man, bad man, all I know is bad man
Houzin down to Savan, I does run with Rock Man
Rock man, rock man, yes I am a rock man
But I get girl from Cruz, and I get girl from St. John
New slang, new slang, I spitting that new slang
I ain’t never had nothing, man been broke for too long
Wassup? Wassup? Tell them haters wassup
If they looking for me, I’m vacationing on Vessup
Hold on, hold on, please big man, just hold on
This is not no softness, this is not no love song
Theron, Theron, yes my name is Theron
My mother name me Theron
When you see me, call me Theron!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I went to the prom in a foreign car
I be going hard like it’s no tomorrow
Parallel park by the Georgia Dome
In the parking lot getting Georgia dome
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, G-A is where I stay
I came up in a trap house and booming yay like everyday
I might pull up in that bitch in a Porsche, showing no remorse
Yelling "fuck y’all!", intercourse
Winners’ choice, I’ll get her moist, PRPS is my denim choice
Everything I got exclusive, if it sell out, it won’t be anymore
I’m getting pussy galore, opportunity knocking, it’s been at the door
I just might be in my Maybach, I had a Beamer before

[Chorus]

[Intro-Hook]
Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter 
Trying to make it to the top but someone kicked over the latter

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. President we’re running out of patience
Tuitions hit the ceiling cant afford an education
Prisons are privatized and the board members are racists
Using stop and frisk, to lock us up in cages
Mass incarceration invading the population
If it’s a war on Niggas why not squeeze triggers
I’ll rather loose my life fighting in a war
Therefore, we aint got to worry about indictments
The Government set us up to fail 
Sent jobs over sees then gave us drugs to sell
Source hearings are killing us cant make bail
Stevie can see the injustices, feel us like braille

[Chorus
 1]
Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter
Trying to make it to the top 
But someone kicked over the latter

[Verse 2]
The first amendment we’re giving is the freedom of speech 
And I’m qualified to speak on behalf of the streets
Screaming justice and peace
Tears running like creeks
Faith have been decreased
Spiritual leaders are weak
Can I breathe on this beat
Mr. President the systems been breached
We’re not anti police
But we demand another way to police the police
With a pen I’m a thereat
Ortega Gasset
"Revolt of the Masses" I don’t fear death
When trapped in a corner feeling like nothing left
You will learn black lives matter, I aint holding my breath

[Chorus
 2]
Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter
Trying to make it to the top but someone kicked over the latter

[Verse 3]
Employment is decreasing
Murder rate is increasing
Under capitalism on ten percent is eating
90 percent is starving
Written beyond the margin 
How do we suppose to harvest
When there’s blood in the garden
I admit we’re not trying our hardest 
If we did we’ll be farther but regardless
We wont tolerate being a target, for marksmen cause we’re dark-skinned 
Dreaming about trying to win on park bench
Change the laws of expungement 
Can you if you want it
If you cant then who could cause in my hood they want it
Police are killing us Background checks are killing us
But we will survive cause aint’ nobody real as us

[Chorus
 3]
- Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter
Trying to make it to the top but someone kicked over the latter
- Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter
Trying to make it to the top but someone kicked over the latter
-Dear Mr. President
This may be irrelevant
Cause your inside the white house with all your embellishments 
But I’m fed up and somebody got to tell this shit
It’s a War on Niggas "VETERANS"
- Dear Mr. President do Black Lives Matter
Or is it just chit chatter
Trying to make it to the top but someone kicked over the latter

* - Kangol Slim is the only rapper on this song

Chorus:

Follow me now cuz I’m a red hot pepper boy
Follow me now cuz I’m a red hot pepper boy
And you know I like the way that you be workin’ it
Shake it up, move it round, now twerk with it
Now I wanna see ya back it all in the street
When you wanna hear this song, tell ‘em play that beat
And you know I like the way that you be workin’ it
Shake it up, move it round, now twerk with it
Now I wanna see ya back it all in the street
When you wanna hear this song, tell ‘em play that beat
Go D.J.

[First Verse]
Now we some real high-stepper boys
And a repper boys
Everywhere we go they call us cayenne pepper boys
Yes you better believe
It’s P-N-C, the boys that made you wanna score a drop top Z
We be all in
Me and my hounds from Gert-Town shot callin’
Got it sewed up, from Texas to New Orleans
Drama Squad, P-N-C we be never fallin’
We all in
Now everybody in the city say that we be vibin’ man
Don’t try to test us cuz you get crushed like a can
Everybody wanna do the same thing
Use trigger man
But sometimes things need to change
Like some of these things just don’t belong here
Sometimes things just need to change
So I rearranged the game and started the saying
That everybody better just, follow me man
Come on!

Chorus

[Second Verse]
It’s extraordinary, not out the ordinary
The way they back that thing in the street just make me tell the D.J.

(Crowd)

Say Slim they say you actin’ funny with your money?

No sweet thang I ain’t actin’ strange with my change

Cuz I got friends too, baby what’cha wanna do?

(Girl)

Well that’s all on you
And we can have us a gangsta party
Call up Tre, cuz I think things bout to get naughty

Chorus

[Bridge One]
This for my Z riders, in the city what’cha call straight on fire
We bumpin’ and you burn rubber with your tires
I mean this strictly for my Z, two, eight riders, that’s on fire
This for my Z riders, in the city what’cha call straight on fire
We bumpin’ and you burn rubber with your tires

Chorus

[Bridge Two]
Hey lil’ soldiers, where them pepper girls out the Wild Magnolia?
Hey lil’ soldiers, where them pepper boys out the Wild Magnolia?
Hey lil’ warriors, where them pepper boys out the Wild St. Thomas?
Hey lil’ warriors, where them pepper girls out the Wild St. Thomas?

Chorus

[scratch the songs "Pump The Party" & "N.O. Block party" with chanting]

[Pacewon]
Uh-huh, rock on
Cheeba cheeba y’all, cheeba cheeba y’all
Cheeba cheeba y’all, rock on

If you broker than a joker, pockets on E
Or just got stuck after clockin all week
The gat 12.50 and the rocket’s on me
Now you can roll through your hardest projects on feet
Now you can send ‘em upstream like bass they dead fish
Spend your money with me, watch how fast you get rich
See I take it by force while they come with a soft sound
Like they with they girl, carriage and horse style
I’m a drunk, see I can’t put the sauce down
Girls that I fucked in the past turn me off now
Crooked, I done snatched a hundred chains
Versace shades since Big, nuttin changed
Sensors go off when the pussy come in range
Down with the Wons we the most wanted gang
Raise hell, skip bail, inhale, weed smoke
+Poppa Large+ big shot from the East coast
Bring your two teeth I’m lost like +Kool Keith+
In a tinted up Sedan, plushed out with blue seats
The rims on the whip cost about two each
Better stop and pay attention everytime my crew speak
Smart like Bill Gates, check me out in Newsweek
Showin off like I’m sunbathin on a nude beach
The moral of the story is niggaz gotta rock
You can’t move nothin right here - we got it locked!

And these Jakes ‘noyd at me cause they make toy money
They upset cause they see me with a Playboy bunny
And I just shove my head in the hole, get up and go
Up late every night like David Letterman yo
Singin "We Want the Funk" off three blunts of skunk
Got a G and a bitch that I see once a month
A girl across the border, or the one your daughter
I’m not normal don’t get caught up, my style is too water
like, H2O and I race through hoes
I take ‘em tall and light-skinned but I ain’t racial though
I get, busy with mine, I take Dominican dimes
Little chicks comin up with the city in mind
West Indian eyes with some serious thighs
So pretty and fine hope she give me the time of day..
.. and make me feel this need
To have to give her that ring like my man Willis Reed
Snatch up the dice and roll five by six
Headcrack you bitches while you ride my dick
Then, giggle a little cause your pockets is brittle
And your game is kinda slow, nigga pass me a pillow
I’m the one on the streets, I’m the Don on the block
LOCKED!

Genelec
Memphis Reigns...
Clarity of a Terrorist.
Presidential.
 
Genelec:
 
I exist as an independent entity, governments possess no knowledge of this identity
Operation Power Chancer
Under investigation for the distribution of treasonous propaganda
By Nary 80 and Steel Panther
Seven continents my feet have roamed
Instantly command everyone of them, overthrow
Rebel activity’s unknown, during massive electricity overload
I snuck into the hanger to download various march codes
Two weeks later the challenger exposed
You didn’t know about the NATO senate chamber?
I rearranged the data on the motherfuckin label translaters
Chaos creater, trained in criminology, geology and neural psychology
Interceptin’ chinese technologies to leave Russian satellites blocked
Penetrated fort knox like it was guarded by luggage mocks
Then target the leaders in North Korea
Took the fuckin twilight camp to the Mona Lisa
Abused for World War III, proceed to sparkin’
Crashing American Stock Markets
Leave the whole world in disarray
By sending virus form: The Y2K
 
*DJing*
 
Memphis Reigns:
 
Yo, I dont quit when im ahead
Stop when I say so, crews who get their peace like kids who’re playing lego’s
Super Agents who fly skys i play the lay low
Wanted internationally like Carmon SanDiego.
Master of disguise change face at any pace
Rendevouz at any place, no existence of my state
Renegades are paged crew stations and databases 
Mortal hostile surrender are more than navy bases
United Nations know solutions to the infiltrations
Wanted by the Federal Bureau, of Investigation
Patient with the force proceed i sign and crush ya
Advanced technological armor stolen from Russia
Super diabolical seeds a planet needs mutated by scientifical labs and Japanese..
For the purpose: Undercover, no sight of what im seeing
X-files delete, for the defeating of European’s
Identity erased
Unknown discovered weaponry
Blowin’ up the SPOTS like heads on John Kennedy....
 
*airplane engine*
 
"Let every nation know!"

If my throat could hit them notes, I could have been Wanye
I feel as though I’m at the Silverdome to lift Andre
Soy muy Rico, but never been suave
I eat a pound of uncooked rice and spit sake
 
So folks asking where’s soul at
It’s been a whole year, he dropped no tracks
But they don’t ask why my bones jabbed
against my skin or why I ain’t playing phone tag
 
Well, my phone had this notepad
And this notepad had a note that
I wrote that lists the pros and cons
of taking my life with my own hands
 
What a rochambeau to the gonads
not to beat a dead horse to the bone fragments
But I learned that being my own man’s
more than just not being my old man
Where the hell you been
If I told you, then you’d Bellevue me
This what happens when you tell Truman
You stealth view him
Ain’t started from the bottom but I fell through it

You said that my pen is a gift
Well, so was Elliott Smith’s
So that don’t help me a bit
If they find my body with a belt looped 
Around my neck ‘cause I ain’t get my wellbutrin
 
Back then thought I’d get that milli
I guess that’s just that Sendak in me
‘cause now I’m more grown up than Kev and Winnie
But I ain’t blown up yet like Wedge Antilles
 
I don’t do it for delf 
I’mma spread that Philly
Friends and family gotta spend that with me
Step back give me a little room to exist
‘cause I ain’t moving an inch 
Brought a bedpan with me
Need a day to myself like Rex Manning
Because I’m up to a my neck as that Redman image
On Dare Iz a Dark and I’m scared if I stop
Everywhere that I walk is a dead man’s ceiling
 
And a pump action up in the trunk can’t fix it
Got the funk, can’t fib it
Y’all are just fan fiction
Got one hand gripping on the rug that’s lifting 
Under from them slipping with their stunt mans ‘n em
 
This is not a come back
I’m just Todd Smith 
On his Mama Said Knock shit
Y’all get ungiven fucks and crickets
Tell your cut man this’ll be a blood baptism
 
You’d say he’s the best
If I beat my chest’til no beats are left
Can I decompress
Life isn’t gonna sleep a sec
Similar to white sniffers with a cheap connect
 
What’d you do on your worst day
You soul searched
What’d you get for your birthday
Two ulcers
You poachers move closer
And my reaction’ll turn your kneecaps to coasters  
 
Came outta my coma
Hard to kill
So y’all gon’ feel
Like the player on my poster
Getting dunked on
If you’re thinking I’m wrong
You can take it up with BOFA
 
Gotta deal with them salty feelings 
Like Kel with the L that he caught from Kenan
Ghost got him with gospel reading
I chose the om shanti and nostril breathing
 
I fought my demons since Ra’s Al Ghul
And y’all can see it in the way I grew
So I could never be the Pepe La Peu
Type to say I do and then say adieu
 
What deja vu!
Is that a face I knew
Wait, ain’t I youAre you an A.I. too
‘Cause you say sky, and they say cielo
But that doesn’t mean that it ain’t azul 
 
I got a way with words
Sometimes that’s how i got away with words
The kind that stains the earth with blood
And that ain’t something that entertainment’s
 
Nobody owes me their forgiveness
But I hope that you know that I’m listening
When you say that if you were gone
Nobody would notice the difference
but you’re so wrong

[Akon]
Convict, convict, convict

[Youngbloodz]
Young-Young-Young-Youngbloodz
Young-Young-Young-Youngbloodz
That-Th-that-That-Th-that
That-Th-that-That-Th-that

[Sean Paul (Akon)]
I tote that thing, nah mean
Hat lean, clothes smell like green
And some white tees and white rees
About bread real G’s get cheese
Back to the streets, back with (Akon)
Back for the A, reppin’ for the slums
Put ya hood up show a nigga where ya from
And if they hate that then get the job done

[Hook - Akon]
Hey, I’m sure you know my steez
Rollin’ presidential through ya hood like G’s
Gotcha higher than Chris Tucker

[J-Bo]
Sixteen, I’ma give it to ya raw
Take it to ya ass, slap ya clean cross the jaw
Now where they at where they, you want some
See I don’t think y’all really want none
See I’m back with a whole new clip
With a badass chick, on some brand new shit
Now put ‘em up, put ‘em up to the sky
Get buck, get drunk, get high
Shake ‘em off, ya know what to do
Take it to the floor, call out ya whole crew
Like what, knuck if ya buck
See we still don’t give a damn and I never gave a fuck
See I’m big timin’ wrists stay blindin’
With four or five freaks, and my pinky ring shinin’
I stay grindin’ and true to the streets
If you ever need to find me then you know where we can meet

[Hook]

[Sean Paul]
I build big bank and drank drank
That’s why I got a purple Sprite, and y’all aint
I ride big rims, sittin’ this tall
So when ya step down, baby girl don’t fall
Y’all niggaz know the name, they call me Sean Paul
And I ain’t got no flaws, except breakin’ the laws
Niggaz call me dope, cause I’m hard and I’m raw
Can call me that fiend, one hit’ll make ya cough
It’s always beside me, watch got diamonds
I ain’t part timin’, I’m full time grindin’
The nigga wasn’t shinin’ live nigga blindin’
I’m with niggaz with the dimes in the whips I be ridin’
And I don’t pull ‘em out, until the trunk beat
And ya can see ya movie sittin’ in the back seat
They wild on the east, they live in these streets
So I’ma keep my piece sittin’ on the front seat

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Peanut Flame aka Nut Da Kidd]

Yea, born Curtis you done seen me before

Hood miss me cause I be on the road
They understand I’m just busy my dough

Still rock my 10 dollar 9th Ward necklace
Still roaming the streets like I ain’t a investment
Your eyeing my possession - but my eye in my possession
Yea sometimes a no protection
Man thats just the kind of respect that I get
I’m the kidd-kidd, like these people just behind - but I’m not scurred
Cause they just following me to my concert

Bitch, bitch
...flavors
She says she were Jamaican and halfCaucasian
I asked for her number she told me hurry and take it
Cause she diggin’ my flavor and can’t even fake it
I’m rockin rich yung, dolces and true religion
She try to bite my swag but my flavor expensive
I light of my swisher thuggin confidential
Call me Dolph Obama feelin very Presidential
Ready to do numbers for the work wonders
Paper Route we buy everything
For the record ball every day because tomorrow is no promise
Neiman Marcus shoppin with my chocolate model from Vegas I got flavors, I got flavors

[Scream]
She says she really like my flavor
When it come to girls I don’t have a favorite flavor
Chocolate Caramel Vanilla I like all flavors
Confidential is good but OG my favorite flavor
Countin Charlie me and Bubba at the RoundTable
Another day another dollar I got another flavor
Fruity Blue and Yellow diamonds look like life savers
I got flavor, I got flavor

What it is, what it do, verse 2
They say I’m cheating with the girls because my diamonds flirt too
I walk up in the spot my ears speak to the haters
Blue and yellow wrist the same color as the Pacers
Just got a fruity... the same color as the Lakers
Money going back and forth I call that ping pong
I bumped into this Asian girls say her name Mee Chong
Independent by Webbie she say that’s her theme song
No panties by Young Dolph she say that her ringtone
Three different flavors, and a calculator
Three in the morning Dolph still counting paper

When it come to girls I don’t have a favorite flavor
Chocolate Caramel Vanilla I like all flavors
Confidential is good but OG my favorite flavor
Countin Charlie me and Bubba at the RoundTable
Another day another dollar I got another flavor
Fruity Blue and Yellow diamonds look like life savers
I got flavor, I got flavor

Everybody say they got swag but Dolph got Flavor
Gucci Loafers, Gucci Bag filled with light green paper
They say I got my Caramel and Chocolate then snickers
I payed twice the car note for these pair snickers
I mix the blunt with three different flavors of reefer
Gotta Beamer in my pocket all Cash no visa
I’m black as a nigerian with hair like a Mexican
Your bitch love my flavor that’s why she send me text messages
She asks me when can I make time to come and have sex again
She say she wanna sick me till I make a big mess again
I’m shopping in Beverly Hills but I’m from Castalia
I got flavor, I got flavor

When it come to girls I don’t have a favorite flavor
Chocolate Caramel Vanilla I like all flavors
Confidential is good but OG my favorite flavor
Countin Charlie me and Bubba at the RoundTable
Another day another dollar I got another flavor
Fruity Blue and Yellow diamonds look like life savers
I got flavor, I got flavor

[Verse 1]
It I was a stone you’d be my rock
If I fell out of love you’d catch my fall
And if I’m just a little baby you’re my all
Like a brother and his keeper you’re the key to my heart
If I need a ride girl you’re my car
No matter the destination baby near or far
You take me there with no complaints
That’s why you’re mine with no restraints

[Chorus]
There wont be a moment that I ever wanna give you up
Cause I ain’t trying to build a brand new trust with anyone, no not with anyone
We’ve got something greater than I’ve ever known
And I don’t wanna let this go for anything
No one will ever do me better
Its you I’m to be counting on
Too long I been searching for what’s been right here in front of my face
You’re my inspiration, to be all I can be
To do all that I do, you’re everything to me
Here’s your standing ovation, you deserve a round of applause
For everything you are

[Verse 2]
If I need a drink, you’d quench my thirst
If I was in pain you’d heal my hurt
And if I need a little you’d just give me your all
Like a mother and a child I need you to stay strong
If I ain’t have a job you’d do the work
No matter how hard it is because you feel I’m worth it
Treat me like a king and that why you my purpose

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if I’m ever alone, I know that I can depend on you to be
Here in a hurry when I call [2x]

You’re my inspiration, to be all I can be
To do all that I do, you’re everything to me
Here’s your standing ovation, you deserve a round of applause
For everything you are

I’m the product of a by-gone age
back when the fashion was high-top fades
the motif was cocaine, rope chains and gold teeth
808 dope beats, kick a box - no seat
5-star rims, jet black tints
windbreaker suits, windmills, backspins
Carharts, Timberlands, and Motorola pagers
Starter jackets: either Georgetown or Oakland Raiders
Lunchroom freestyle battles, high-schoolers
fadin’ off of OE or Crooked-I coolers
Mexican bags and mescaline tabs
Brand Nube’s at the Muse so we catchin’ the PATH
Back when underground radio kept North Jersey bumpin’
Teddy Ted and Special K, Kevin, Keith and Dirty Dozen
Who could be on BLS
who’s king of the mixtapes?
Red Alert on KISS-FM cuttin’ like a switchblade
Take a look around, Great Adventures of Slick Rick
Funky Technician, Strictly Business
I would say that things ain’t the way they used to be
but fuck that - them days are gone now and ain’t never gonna come back
I ain’t got no jewels or ice, I’m played out
I spit ‘cause I’m nice on the mic, I’m played out
I didn’t blow up overnight, I’m played out

(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

I’ve been doin’ it since back in the days, I’m played out
I’m not up on the latest craze, I’m played out
I’m still strugglin’ to get paid, that’s played out

(**scratched** )My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Yo, It’s a known fact
Foul Mouth Jerk’s a throwback
Still stuck on that old rap, the pro-black
now somebody give my broke-ass a soul clap
Still walk with my hand on my jewels, holdin’ my Bozack
Only smoke Sess, Cheeba, or Buddha-bless cause I’m def
dumb, hype, chilly and super-fresh
kickin’ the ballistics, drop science, and flow the funky shit
I don’t holla at bitches, man, I kick it to the honey-dips
with the lovliest, girl you know my flavor
fuck a cell phone, hit me on my Skypager
so I can hit the skinz, I got somethin for ya kittycat
latex for safe sex, pocket full of Jimmy hats
Smokin’ on the nicklesack
In my fishin hat, if it’s not my shearling
I probably rock a Triplefat
I can tell you on my tip, ‘cause you know what time it is
I’m clockin’ crazy dollars, so I push the flyest whips..
Naaaaaahhhhh
Ya’ll suckas can’t fade my Cross Colours
so step off before I catch wreck and cause ruckus
I’m jettin’, I’m proofin’, I’m ghost, I’m Swayze
I’m peace an’ I’m Audi 5000, Baby!
Got gold and platimum plaques, I’m played out
I’m lucky just to be on wax, I’m played out

When I rock, man, I stick to the facts, that’s played out
(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Don’t got a single that’s hot in the club, played out

I ain’t a damn pimp or a thug, played out
I’m just glad not to be locked up, that’s played out
(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Still got the boombox that only plays cassettes

Still bumpin PRT, Kris, Kane, Finesse
Chub Rock, King Sun in my tape deck
still watch New Jersey Drive on VHS
still got that ol’ gold in the chokehold
still rock a b-boy stance in photos
still playin’ Tyson Punchout and Tecmo Bowl
Ain’t got no Sean John, Phat Farm or Esco clothes
Got my Champion hoodie, still wear Girbauds
Rock a Ewing hi-tops, got two pairs of those
Still rock ‘em untied with two dumb fat laces
Still hit 48 bars, no hooks or catch-phrases
Real kool kats still dance when I rap
cause I go back to the wall, it’s wack to do that
so fuck anyone who says that I’m past my prime ‘cause I get better with age
like a glass of wine, but still I’d be rich
if I had a dime for everytime, I wished I could go back in time
with my fattest rhymes and make the platnium mine
but I still probably wouldn’t be satisfied
I’M PLAYED OUT!
I’m literally played out

(**scratched**) My life is played out... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

(**scratched**) My life is played out like a Jheri Curl... (B.I.G - from Ready to Die)

Damn right you’re played out!
You better put some fuckin’ spinners on that song or somethin;
Jesus Christ dude! Why don’t you take your broke ass back to ‘93
and do a St. Ides commercial or some shit...?

Played out motherfucker

Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat, only comfort that I keep
‘Cause in a moment I’ll be something you will forget

Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I’m blown blown blown

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn’t the one for you, but at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why’d you two part ways?"
But if my memories right, you’re the one that left

I’ll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I’m blown blown blown

Yours to lift me higher
But I guess our time’s expired
I’m giving you the match
Set our love on fire

Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I’m blown blown blown

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn’t the one for you, but at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why’d you two part ways?"
But if my memories right, you’re the one that left

I’ll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I’m blown blown blown

Ooh yeah, I’m blown blown blown
Yeah, I’m blown blown blown

[Chorus](4X)
"The rhythm" -> Biz Markie
"Make you co-op-er-rate with the rhythm"

[Verse 1: Godfather Don]
My mind is cloudy, nigga I wanna get rowdy
That’s how we do shit, a few clips and then we outty
Give me some room to get verbal and in vulgar
I got you thumpin’ something like I holdin’ your roller
Your pain is inflicted with shits from my scripts kicked
I got you open, you peeps are scopin’ where my dick sits
All in ya knows why you pose like a faggot
It’s like I shit it, the father did it, beheaded dragon
Still on my tip for the technical fast flow
There ain’t no cash, so, stay the fuck out my ass hole
Towards is the last song, so blessed on, with Teflon
With meth on my mind got left, shit, a fly couldn’t catch one

[Verse 2: JuJu]
Fuck keepin’ it real, I ain’t jokin’
You bitch-ass niggas act hard and they still get their shit broken
Wildin’ is risky but it’s fun
I’m on some ol’ cowboy shit, give me some whiskey and a fuckin’ gun
You watchin’ niggas set it off son
I have all you niggas runnin’ like girls when I let off one
A little nigga goin’ far you know I’m a star
I got your wife, kid, sittin’ in my fuckin’ car
Let them niggas try and curse mine
I heard niggas liked they comin’ through the Island for the first time
Junkyard Ju represent, no doubt, 3CF mob, fuck the world and I’m out

[Chorus](4X)

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse]
Check it I catch wreck when my mind’s set
When it’s time to get down I get around like nine etch
Give me your ring I can still swing I fuck
With these four bore rappers when you can have a real thing
So just cool it, I flow like fluid
Ain’t nothing to it I keep it raw like suage
Huh, brothers think they got my flow figured
But you can have a afro on slacks that don’t mean you got soul nigga
Stand back, don’t try to keep close
It’s the Funky Man, Lord Finesse straight from the Eastcoast
I can’t hang, come on, picture that
I’m from Uptown, Boogie Down where rap was invented at
Matter of fact I’m out to stack figures
When I drop rhymes I make brothers go ‘Yo who’s that nigga!?’
Fuck around you’ll get your ass fried this ain’t Pharcyde
I’m not someone nigga  that you go +Passed By+
Come on, you’re rollin’ with a page star
I keep my money in rolls just like my motherfuckin’ breaks are
No doubt, I got clout I’m gonna say peace adios one love
Yo, I’m out

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah, here comes the night time stalker
Who’s swelling niggas’ lips rather than Jimmy Walker
The freestyler, nigga get scuela
Fuck a bitch, you know I’m all about makin’ dollars
Fat Joe, you know I been here before
Rap was for the near, but was kickin’ shit raw
Motherfuckers know the flow was tight
Baggin’ hoes like the Puerto Rican Dolomites
Man listen, there’s no competition
‘Joe takin’ it out?’ look nigga keep wishin’
Fat Joe and you know how we do
Peace to Big Ed, and my nigga JuJu
Word

[Chorus](4X)

[Verse 5: Bas Blasta]
Come fo’ rough with the rhyme crew fresh
Bas bless the words penetrate through flesh
Why not pay dues to earn props
You soundin’ like my nigga
I’m not gonna pay the bucket, yo
I’m comin’ of okay, makin’ rappers run like O.J.
With a big clan, like the man who’s named Jos\xc3\xa9
No way will the competitor
Get out of the bloods that the wildlife predator
Straight through your brain is where I aim
When I start to inflict pain you will never be able to maintain
Insane, with my manuscript rappers can’t get with the way I’m kickin’ it
I can’t stand a hypocrite who tries to trust and cling styles
He fails to rouse with the fatality of a child
Bas got mad rhymes the party bounces
I think there’s no book that weighs forty ounces

[Chorus](4X)

If I only knew then what I know now
shit would be so wild
mind of a man, soul of a child
no clouds could rain on me
no cuts or scrapes could leave blood stains on me
just imagine
how to side step the critics, understand my own limits
embrace the fire when I’m thrown in it
move with supreme confidence, through every team in the conference
reconcile dreams of common sense, dominant
no fears or insecurities, appreciate the impurities
build on that, never second guess it, never neglect the lesson
on every endeavor I bless the session, man
y’all dont know the half of it, trying to make my renditions accurate
hoping I can capture it for y’all, but now it’s like today is my four walls

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

{*cuts from Nas "One Mic"*}
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back... it’s done

yo, put my best foot forward, took two steps, toward the opposite
back and forth with things, saw a lotta shit
and I was under pressure, now I’m on top of it
so now I’m taking all I can get
my getaway hit the fork in the road and took the scenic route
‘tween me and you, it brought the phoenix out of me
so partner you can hate me or love me, cause I might have been wrong
but my heart was pure, still, I cant say I dont have regrets
made mistakes I that wont soon forget, expectations I haven’t met
and yet, I wouldn’t trade this moment, pray for atonement
take me for what I am, a romantic but I’m not hopeless
writing my magnum opus, either you’re high pysch, or lose focus
if you let it, some of y’all will never get it, holding on to...

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

{*cuts from Nas "One Mic"*}
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back... it’s done

I guess that you could say we got a history together
so I can never forget her, not bitter
matter of fact sometimes I still hit it
seduced by the way that she call to come hither
but I found out the first time I did her
I’ll never fall in love with her, she gone break your heart
make a mark, leave, and never come back
and its hard to say goodbye to her, nobody knows her like I knew her
see she one of a kind, just a free spirit, embodied by these lyrics
to some, she’s not pretty, to me she’s beautiful
cause she made me what I am and taught me to be strong
so even when she’s gone, her memory lives on
and over time eventually we lost contact, despite that
I gotta admit, I’m still attached, but I can’t take her back
cause who I’m talking about is...

yesterday...
yesterday is gone...

{*cuts from Nas "One Mic"*}
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back...
no time for lookin back... it’s done

[Median]
Do it, do it - open my thoughts
Open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night, embrace my life
Grasp passion and actions and put it in flight, yeah
Heh, open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions 
and put it in flight - the stairways
Let me explain, I did it with flow back in the day
Ha, woulda said "no homo" but I’m a grown man
Heh, woulda fed mo’ Totos but I’m a known dad
Best believe I’m still workin on that foreign land
and I’m just checkin in, likin what I’m seein
I might kick it for a minute with my informal mistress
The groove got ‘em trickin, and treatin, feedin ‘em
They eatin, it’s delicious, hit ‘em where the beat is
Thinkin ‘bout Gee again, lately we’ve been speaking
Thought about a question and it needs to be the thesis
You think that it would lead me there, I can’t even speak of it
Wishin by the mentioning of his name that he could be again
By simply speaking it, anyone you miss you do the same
And on the light of things, for those who only peep for entertainment
Let me abracadabra David Blaine a bit, 3000 ya, put you on the range
Right near the beach somewhere in Africa
T-Paining your log cabin in Asp-irin, {*inhales*} gasp a bit
Now let me back in, this is magic
The chemistry we’re making, everytime I open up my thoughts
Excuse me, was that the Dungeon Family School methods you just used against me?
I learned so many styles, forgive me, heh
Open my thoughts, open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions 
and put it in flight - the stairways
Start steppin to the track, makin airwaves
Immortalize divine designed for the airplay
I dare say air it out, let me be your audio coat, just wear it out
Posted no cares in the couch, whatever you’re about
Headphones with the iPod, preparin for a bout
Just crusin, a play in the lot, not really movin
Parkin lot pimpin, mergin on your Michelins
Don’t forget the blinkers, study long study wrong
Don’t forget your thinkers, keep an open mind
towards the night and what it brings to you, the many things that kings do
And queens too, swimmin in jeans due in the gene pool
Pursuin the dream, it use to be a visu
But no no, that’s a no-no, I like to think that I’m
as genuine as Levi’s, as far as hip-hop
I seen the same happen to bebop and doo-wop and Reebok
In my parable, that fast jazz had more comparisons
Pause grandad -- open my thoughts
Open my thoughts to a new night
Open my thoughts to a new night, embrace my life
Grasp passion and actions and put it in flight, yeah
Heh, open my thoughts to a new night
Embrace my life, grasp passion and actions 
and put it in flight - the stairways, hey
You’re only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass’ll be a has-what
Yeah, you’re only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass’ll be a has-what
Yeah, you’re only funky as your last cut
Focus on the past, your ass’ll be a has-what, yeah

[Intro]
Said I’m calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
Everything glowing ain’t a diamond
I know everything glowing ain’t a diamond
Girl you shining

[Chorus]
But I ain’t felt love in a long time, and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with money, I ain’t playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Verse 1]
Killing these niggas, I got a feeling
these niggas is out to get me but trust me I got ‘em
Straight out the borough my city love me we thorough
My nigga you don’t want none of them problems
She acting crazy she calling me baby I just be feeding them bitches the bottles
She live in way up in Harlem but she come to me when I call her
And she all about her fashion she be working for Vogue
Me I’m all about my stacking I be working the road

[Bridge]
But them clouds never get old
Them clouds clouds never get old

[Verse 2]
So focused on, make the dopest song
Got this chick open on, got her lit on patron
Got her ticked off, cause I got no tick for her
I got no time, but I got some dick for her now
She was lit, I was milk
Girl don’t let that milk spoil
You got some friends that stress you
He ain’t loyal, I got some friends, don’t let ‘em think for you now
Pull up the whip for you now, here go the town
I am no pimp, but I am a player
You not with the shits? I’ll talk to you later
I’m playing girl I got a thing for you now

[Chorus]
But I ain’t felt love in a long time, and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with money, I ain’t playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Bridge]
718 to your state, 212 to your city
My best pick up line is young nigga with money, I ain’t playing
718 to your state, 212 to your city

[Verse 3]
Throwing fishing nets in the ocean to cash
Good catch, here’s to hoping it last, nigga
And bring them hoes back to the pad from the show
But only if they know how to act, nigga
Don’t ever get stuck on your laurels like
All of them stuck in the past niggas
Shit, it’s how I got past niggas
For real

[Outro]
Said I’m calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the ride up
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna

[Intro]
"Hey look let me tell y’all somethin, aight?
 What I do, I do, straight like that.
 So ain’t no sense in y’all even troublin y’all selves over that.
 Cause man the way I feel right now today..."

[Denaun]
I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defense
And I got too much way too fast, momma told me it won’t last
Now I’m back down on the bottom wishin that I took another path
I should’ve listened, but my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit yo when it’s on, it’s on
Yeah, e’rybody wrong, yeah, and I’m always right
Yeah, ain’t nobody to blame now, it’s me vs. me, man this my fight

[Chorus: Denaun]
So don’t look at me
like I am the same person I was before, fore, fore
Now, we all deserve a second chance
And this time I think I can do more, more, more
Or better

[Interlude: Denaun]
Yeah I put that on my family
All you gotta do is give me the chance (me the chance)
And I can show you that I’m worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I’m a fighter, I won’t get tired
When I’m back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, gotta get out!

[Denaun]
You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin my book by the cover, maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
And I ain’t tryna vent
This ain’t woe is me, it’s nothin owed to me
Keep the swan song, I don’t need an ode to me
Shit, hopefully holdin this rosary
will keep me out of close calls with the old police
I said I’m tryna be a whole new me, I ain’t tryna do the same old thing
I’m tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
no more trouble around, I ain’t gotta do nothing but stay out of shit
I ain’t gotta be up in the chaotic, it’s
probably cause it’s my redemption, that I’m entrenched in
And I won’t let anybody deny my vision, it’s my decision
But y’all ain’t listenin (but y’all ain’t listenin)

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Denaun]
It’s my gameplan now
Is to get in this ring and show that I’m a changed man and how
I won’t blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me, but hopefully
I can restore that back where it’s supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight mean much more than that
I’m tryna think before I react
I ain’t get the message at first, I tried to ignore the facts
But I’m much older, she’s my soldier, I told ya, I’d go to war for that
I said the boy is the truth and it’s no lie in him
All he need is his family with him
Y’all want him ‘til it’s no room given
I’ma hit him ‘til the ref come and get him

[Chorus]

(Intro, news interview with elderly lady)
Yeah, she has a gun and I went and got her a gun permit!
Now they didn’t have to shoot that old lady down like a dog...
They didn’t have to do that! It’s one old woman in that house!
I got burglar bars there to try to protect her...
I got mercury lights out there to keep it BRIGHT and LIGHT!
I’M AS MAD AS HELL! AND SOMEBODY’S GON ANSWER TO THAT!

(News reporter)
Police are defending the shooting death of a ninety-two year old woman
Happened as plain clothes officers burst into her home last night-
-to server a search warrant for drugs
Police say they made an undercover drug-buy at the house earlier in the day
The womans’ niece said, "there were never drugs in the house, and her aunt-
-lived alone and probably just panicked"
The family’s furious

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more

(Verse 1, Krayzie Bone)
Chillin’ on my mama’s front porch, I’m watchin
Sittin here reminiscin’ on how hot the block is
From right here, I can truly see how crooked the cops is
My vision gettin blurry as I look at my options
I could; just let ‘em drop me, or I could cock it and pop it
The way they murdered Oscar was preposterous nonsense
They talkin with they Glocks, conversation is violence
And they wonder why society is criminal minded
They never gon’ change, come around my way
Another one shot down; slain, while the cop got praised
It’s hard to maintain, when they supposed to protect us
You or me could be the next one; bleeding injustice

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin’
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It’s very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 2, Wish Bone)
Time’s gettin all bad, but it was good up in yo neck of the woods
Everybody tend to they own hustle, got much respect; that’s all good
Turn on the news, it’s no surprise to see; Police brutality
And worse they out here gunnin us down in the street
Good use of authority ain’t even in
Rather, the vast majority of them’s to damn incompetent
When is enough gon’ be enough, I ask?
I know we all tryin’a live life free from all the madness
It’s sad enough you gotta watch how they get jacked
But the worst one’s the criminal that’s hiding behind the badge
You try to call up the baby, a waste of time to call ‘em
Cause the only thing they bringin is mo’ problems, so why bother?

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin’
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It’s very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 3, Bizzy Bone)
The Biblical, lick but literal little old me, I kicks the cynical
It’s beautiful livin the minimal, generals and don’t go to sleep until ten o’clock
I’m more alive, please try to fight evil
Me and my people, my people and me; I’m still single
And even though I look meager; I’m eager to make some money
My partners smoke in the direction; My protection from dummies
Hold your head like, bass; got my head gettin stuck
Cause I acted a fool, got sued, slip and slide, what

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin’
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It’s very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 4, Layzie Bone)
Lookin around here and I see the inner city, it makes my heart hurt
Feelin the struggles of my brothers, it takes some hard work
Bein raise by single mothers, the case was caught first
They got daddy in the pen, gotta face the laws worst
No got us, we down, we barely surviving, and knowledge is there
They ain’t providing, they starvin us out to keep us divided; so they can get money and hide it
Operation Silence; the government got some secrets they ain’t tellin
Cause if they let you know, they can’t convict you felon
But they ain’t slippin, let the Thugs know the deal
We comin back to save the ghetto, let the truth be revealed
If we all get on a level, and example some skills
We can all get out of debt, and we can pay off these bills
And just chill

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
It’s so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It’s so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It’s so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can’t pass us by, no more
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin’
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It’s very necessary, He remember this is temporary (Temporary-Temporary)

[Lil Wayne]
Now let me brush off my Pu..
Now let me..
Now let me..

Now let me brush off my Puma’s
This is for the early birds and the late bloomers
My fitted cocked and so is the boomer
My money ain’t funny, but they got a since of humor
And everybody dies, but snitches die sooner
Paint your shirt and room like a Oklahoma Sooner
I’m out of this world, lunar
I’ve got cheese cake like juniors’
The coolest kid on the school yard
Higher then a uniform, scared?
I got work at home, call it home work
I got paper in my backpack
I know you smell me, I’m the shit like an exlac... Oooh!
Diarrhea Dwayne
Bust your fucking head, souvenir your brain
You ain’t talking about nothing
Got your girl leaving out my house, walking out of my house funny
Like her legs are telling jokes
I swear you would have thought it was like a DJ honcho
And we ain’t talking slow, you just listening fast
Boy I’m sitting on green like piss in the grass
Just let me know, and the grass still grow, even if you mow
I’m so N.O
I hope I live until I’m five hundred and four
That’ll be cool

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That’ll, that’ll be cool

[Lil Twist]
I’m so two one four, you know Twist man
I get paper in my bag so bad like a mailman
So fresh, so dope
Head to the show
Sitting on a white and black car with Orealeo
14 is so nice, my flow is so tight
If you trying to see me leave left, go right
Me and Wayne on the same track, Ohh I just like that
With Bizzile on that Cadillacs, but as sharp as a thumb tack
I’m so Young Money, get like Twist dude
I can be a school boy and a "G" like Ice Cube
Like watching Next Friday
Move kid out of my way, it is my way, yes it is my day
Boy, look at her, It’s Young Money roll
We just swerve Maserati
But a coke wadd with sizzle of those from Universal now
I ain’t talking about the label
I’m in a different city but were connected like cable
Ya, we go straight, seven to sable
We put rhymes in your head, ya’ll put money on the table
Weezy, thank you for blessing me "G."
Now all these girls steady asking me..

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That’ll, that’ll be cool

[Lil Twist]
Now wait, let me brush off my Jordans
The ones and the now, I got them for recorded
Mr. Big Family, Young Money’s on
Plus the bus is real sharp
Hey, Money’s real tall
Yea that’s right
Ball till’ we ball
Steady grind hard
Young in the game of girls
Showing black harts and stars
The kid of the south runs things, they easy
Believe me, I’m running hard Obama to Hillary
It ain’t over, got my green and celery
It’s on my dice, it’s on my body, young with a felony
Iced up
Wayne couldn’t help but notice
He just bought a Lambo and got me a new Lotus
Rolling, straight strolling, we hold that
From (the "n" word) some of when of dat it’s cold dat when it’s cold that clothe that
Money on top, I ain’t a Rockefeller, but I hold up the rock, and then ain’t nobody going stop, me
From doing my thing in like big talk
On my body I can’t catch a stain or something like that
Show some rumming[? ] cabrain[? ] the harts to ever do it
So haters step up your game for real man

[Chorus: x2]
Can I roll with you baby?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
Maybe with the Mercedes?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
With things that drive you crazy?
That’ll, that’ll be cool
And if you put that ice on my body?
That’ll, that’ll be cool

This is your captain once again. As we make our descent
into Los Angeles we hope you had a pleasant flight.
The weather conditions are clear blue skies at 126 degrees
and we’ll be in the terminal in less than 30 seconds.
Once again thank you for flying Death Row West.

It’s time to make the dough nutz (*repeat 8X*)

[Verse One]
You see it’s off to the store I got to go it’s how I make the doughnutz
This way at the end of the week yo I collect the bonus
Sunday Monday Wednesday Friday the wrath is risin in the kitchen
The rest of the week I’m zonin - THE SKINS ARE FINGER LICKIN
Big brothers owe me the loot and some are frontin from the stoop
It’s bounty huntin time and someone’s gonna catch the boot
in the ass - no questions, don’t tell me no more lies
Don’t be steppin onto the block, the price you pay is high (how high?)
I’m crackin ‘em up and beatin ‘em down as verily we roll along
Brothers know my style, my grip is just TOO strong
So figure it out yourself and you’ll soon see that I don’t sweat ‘em
His back’s against the wall I say spread ‘em then I wet ‘im
So hi-ho hi-ho hi-ho, it’s off to work I go
I figured I’d let you know, here’s the flow
It’s time to make the dough, nutz, the dough, nutz
I hear the funky beats and I go, nutz

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It’s time (what time is it?) It’s time (what time is it?)
It’s time (what time is it?) It’s time to make the dough nutz

[Verse Two]
Yes rappin again the flow I’ve got no time to sit and pause
Cause when I cook the steel I hear the suckers hit their jaws
I flow from the tongue to let you know just who is up next
Firstborn just slayed the rhythm the opposite of breakin necks
Cause I can rip the best like use the glock to mix the batter
Flex the same ingredients I went to (?) it doesn’t matter
Splatter, scatter, if you move there’s nothin left
Petrified by the dough nutz cause the beats are made to death
So after that you’re left a hole in the middle
So hey diddle diddle, the Kamron’s on the fiddle
So who’s got the blunts with the booooom?
Make room for the zoom of a Y.B.T. tune
If your brain is still drownin then you’re dooooomed

Dough, nutz, the dough, nutz
I hear the funky beats and I go, nutz

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now I’m bringin it back in so let me spark it for the crew
The oven is burnin hot, so look out we’re comin through
Cause the funk is on, MC givin livin up the cookies
Tossin up the styles as we bake it for the rookies
Playin hookies from the back, what does it take to slam a hit?
I’m missin dunkin the donuts is it really worth the trip?
To the top, they go pop, halfway up, we get stopped
But we keep it hip-hop add a little twist of rock
So it’s up and away, it’s up and away, it’s up and away we go
We’re opening up the bakery, it’s time to make the dough-di-oh

[Main Verse: Liliana Saumet]
Llegando ya los amigos
La gente ya esta contenta
Prendamoles los motores
Y ponte ya esa Champeta
Pongamonos los disfraces
Bailemos hasta no poder
La calle ya esta prendida
Y eso es que va manecer
Ya quiero que estemos todos
La vida es para bailar
Y vamonos con el coro
Que estamos pa vacilar
Agarra ya tu pareja
Y si no tienes no importa
Agarra la deste lado
Y despues buelve por otra

[Will Smith]
Fiesta

Hold up
Aight

[Rap Verse: Will Smith]
Hola mamacita (Oh yeah)
Go get me a beera (Oh yeah)
This track is a heater, couldn’t let the beat go
By without a feature (Oh yeah)
Cause it’s hot shit
Only, you know me
O.G.
Hot class and low key
Tryin’ to find me a Sophie, forget her
And a dance floor to tear up
Plus me, I like beauty, Angel
Colombiana, laced in designer
The kind that, gets impatient
Gotta be blatant, walk up behind her (Oooh!)
No gas in me, I’m a Tesla
Teach game, sensei, professor
Will Smith, estrella, the fresh one
Levanteze
Fiesta

Repeat Chorus

[Vado]
Uhh...
Uhh... U.N., Vado man
Light a 50, sit back in the cranberry 550
My slimes with me, this chick money hungry just like Whitley
From +A Different World+, she’s a different girl than others
Different furs in colors
Born with cake though, cabin the woods upstate low
Slept with a lot of known niggaz, a straight hoe
Her shape so put me on with ways to make dough
She got profiles, I make checks, we went bank flow (let’s go)
Ponytail, face low, want me to fuck her mouth
Suck me on the couch, her slurp game got me buggin out (damn)
One day seen a ring on her like "Yo what’s that about?"
She replied "What you chat about? Like let’s not go that route"
(HA~!) Then she tells me on some G shit
I got a secret, I’m with a dude I don’t wanna be with
So peep it, I took him to court, but was defeated
Cause I don’t see none from pre-nup from when he cheated
Could you believe it? In other words, she still with him
But he ain’t never around, so what’s the deal with him?
He out of town mostly is what she told me
No kids by him, big mansion, she be lonely
Not only that, he cheap as fuck but filthy
Too tight for banks, he keep it tucked, you feel me? (I do)
Like a heartbeat, it’s in the crib you tellin me
‘Round the amount about three mill’, definitely
The only thing, he’s in town for a couple weeks
Good! We can do it tonight, run in while he sleep
Cause it’ll be easy if he take us to the cabbage
Long story short, he had that cake up in the attic
The rest bitin and pickin up, money wipin it
Dope vitamins, coke wifey screamin he triflin
With the gun aim all set, we done banged
Turned around hit the stairs bang I hear one rang
Huh? I just stared at her, this bitch ill (ill)
All that cause his life insurance is six mill’
I reacted, laughin, it’s on some snap shit
I ain’t snappin, but what the fuck just happened?
She start cleanin, I’m thinkin of start squeezin
Grab both duffles out of couple and start breezin
It wouldn’t make sense to leave her breathin
It’s a matter of time they catch up to her she start speakin
Believe it

[Intro]
Yeah, DJ Cosm on the beat like
Uhh, Rasul on the track like
Yeah, the DFB in the place like

[Rasul Syed]
Yeah, you know the trials, tribulations
The wild jubilations, the wild lose they patience/patients
like a nurse that don’t concentrate
OJ fresh squeezed, every day feelin great
Well at the least the last few I have
Gotta keep it movin ‘til I see what a view I have
And it ain’t nuttin wrong with gettin right
I am dead serious, you suckers need to get a life
like a video game do
Your buttons get pushed, then they pay you
And me and Cosm, we ain’t into that
You chumps came in, so I ain’t into rap
I’m into what rap fin’ to change to
Can you feel it? Nothin can save you
I sip green tea and not Grey Goose
And ladies greet me on the street like ‘Hey you... hi!’

[Rasul Syed]
Another Rocky Mountain plateau
Another festival, don’t miss that show
I got too much to ride on this
You wanna judge me like a panelist?
Den you won’t reap the benefits
I got these flows, and I’m in the mix
like a high ball - say hi y’all
All the critics in the place say HI BALLS~!
And you can get ‘em like every day
Like a lotto ticket except holidays
I always make beats on those ones
My snotty attitude make your nose run
and make your eyes all watery
I break +Bonds+ with you guys like Connery
It ain’t no stoppin me silly dawg
So why you get all dressed up chili dogs?
And you can ask Cos’ any day
He will not deal wit you in any way
He too busy at Romano’s
You can’t get portion of his time like Motto’s
Give him a bottle that is real son
and he will be the opposite of heat wave, chill son
Chill son, chill son, chill son, chillllllll

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don’t ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks

[Verse 1]
I’m a super savage, got a money habit
I’m addicted to bad bitches I gotta have it
Fear risks every day transporting cabage
In and out of state moving like a chad rabbit
Whole lot of drugs on me gotta meet the casket
Cable boy on the block, tryin to make it happen
Everybody in the squad ain’t no fucking rapper
Try and poke me if you want I’m a get to clappin
They know who to call scorpion’s beyond the package
Money longer than train tracks, ye I’m cashing
Loud men from California and he ain’t taxing
One shipment a month nigga and I’m relaxing

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don’t ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks

[Verse 2]
In the streets every day I be taking risks
Make that work work, make the siff flip
I ain’t taking no losses only taking risks
Fucking foreign bitches, driving foreign wheels
Just rob my plug came up I took a risk
I be taking shit, these niggas fake as shit
What you call your wife, I call a basic bitch
Ass fuck like Bob Marley on my jamaican shit
Don’t make me take the spraying shit, tell ‘em this max and cader shit
Over the stove I’m working out, I’m guilty man I’m with the shit
I ain’t with all that talk and shit, I don’t do no box and shit
All I know is pistols pop we turned up and we dropping shit

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don’t ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks

There’s a dark cloud over this city tonight
As I walk down coca lane
I feel the cold wind blowing through my heart
I feel the blood boiling in my veins
I didn’t know you’d strike like lightning
I thought I knew you so well
You left me standing alone hear so frightened
Frozen by your farewell
So why should I miss you
Tell me why should I love you

Some folks say, the kind of girls I knew
Were a dime a dozen, they were never true
They could walk on water, kiss like fire
Just like you
It must of been the hand that you held over me
A prison of yours, till you set me free
Your no good for me
Your just no good for me
So tell me why should I miss you
Tell me why did I love you

Hey you never did satisfy me
But you sure did try
And I’m alone tonight
But that’s your loss
Not mine

Sweet temptation is so unique
It must of been my strength that made you weak
Your no good for me
Your just no good for me
You were never any good for me
And your still no good for me
Tell me why, tell me why
So tell me why should I miss you
Tell me why did I love you

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
I’m a victim of the very song I sing
These mean streets of N.Y.C.
Got a hold of me, just when I thought I was out
They pull me back in... Aiyo..

[Inspectah Deck]
I’ve been, thrown in the bullpens over again
And I’ve been, sent up a river not built to swim
I had, diamonds and furs all at a young age
And I had, fame and fortune, name on the front page
I got, shot at and sliced twice over some dice
And I got, set up by broads one night while gettin’ nice
I’ve seen, the livest thug cat die over drugs
And I’ve seen, the little nigga that fire the slugs
The hood, gave me free lunch, dumps and Johnny pumps
The hood, gave me free base, gates and shotty pumps
They found, Sonya son, face down in the trash
And they found, the loaded gun and eight rounds in the grass
It’s real, some images’ll make your wide eyes closed
It’s real, I don’t regret it, it’s the life I chose
I made, money and love, move bundles in loads
And I made, plenty of foes, that’s the way it goes

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
When you livin’ in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That’s just the way it goes
Livin’ in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That’s just the way it goes

[Inspectah Deck]
I feel, that it’s a set back, death in a trap
And I feel, the foul presence, so a weapon is strapped
You live? You be talking the town for short time
You live? They be hawkin’ you down with long knives
And still, these are the good times, I wouldn’t contest
But still, I don’t believe this is good as it gets
We tried, to beat the game, playin’ possum, we die
And we tried, to ease the pain, stayin’ constantly high
It’s like, you gotta fight for your life to break bread
It’s like, there’s more cops on the block then baseheads
That’s why, I drop a jewel, spit rude on tape
And that’s why, it’s possible to keep food on the plate
I strive, to persevere, though my dunns ain’t here
And I strive, surprised I made it thirty somewhat years
For now, I get the Presidents, ya hustle low-key
For life, I represent the H-Double O-D

[Chorus]

How can I love you
How can I kiss you
How can I show you what I feel for you
(Somethings I just cant understand, you know)
When you don’t even look my way
I dream about you everyday, yes I do

C’mon
Let me ask you something
How can I, stop thinking about you
When you’re deep in my soul
When I turn off all the lights
Your picture stays inside my mind
Like a fantasy I cant reveal
I get emotional inside
sometimes, I’d rather die
And the worst part you pretend that you don’t even know
Like the world keeps turning
But I cant move on
Somebody help me deal with all my crazy situations
To hold you in my arms, my deepest aspirations
Here’s my confession, imma tell it to the world
Perfection is when I’m dreaming that I’m kissing you girl
i guess I’m just another case, all because that pretty face
Fantasize about your eyes a million times a day
So if you ever get this message, decide you understand
Maybe you feel the same and wanna let me hold your hand
I promise that i’ll never let you down and this is true
My life would be so perfect next to you

How can I love you
(How can I love you girl)
How can I kiss you
How can I show you what I feel for you
When you don’t even look my way
I dream about you everyday yes I do

Yeah,
Come here girl
I need you mama like the desert needs the rain
Matter fact, rainy nights, I kinda go insane
Cuz when I’m by your side, its christmas in july
I can see my future when I’m looking in your eyes
If I ever did you wrong, I apologize
But if I ever did you right, I want the grand prize
Im tired living in this fantasy world
Writing your name a hundred times
But its like you don’t even know me girl
Eyes wide open, but I’m still in the dark
Like an angel from the sky lives inside of my heart
I know one day ill find the strength to say this face to face
And fill you up with happiness so we can runaway
To that perfect destination and make you my queen
Fulfill your fantasies and every dream
So please tell me mama how you feel I gotta know
Se me esta desbaratando el coraz\xc3\xb3n

How can I love you (how)
How can I kiss you (you tell me)
How can I show you what I feel for you
(to show you what I feel for you ma)
When you don’t even look my way
I dream about you everyday yes I do
(every day and every night, tell me how)

Why can’t it only be one instead of whole camps,
Treating my people like scums and bums,
when after every arrest you find blood and donut crumbs,
billy goats they all jump with the billy club
dismiss the badge and get snuff,
And it’s a lock down, one homeboy shot down,
A big gun smoke so that they can meet the quote,
Another less vato walk the street,
take away his wallet so John Doe can tag his feet,
Mr Powell you’ll drop like a pound,
Well send your ass to the hell gates with Daryl,
Cause beating us down is no trivia,
You wanna find America then take your ass to Lybia,
On the intake no show cause I’m down,
interrogated cause I’m Brown

You need to raise up from a buck and straight get loony,
Police they wanna screw me and do me,
But I won’t let em do me.
I’m getting dope like Patrick Swayze
You thinkin that you can fade me,
You crazy,
I’m kicking it with Lighter Shade see,
Don’t step cause you’ll get smoked just like the chronic,
Get on the track and run it, watch it-they go.
Watch me jump on it ,
like kool and the gang I’m swingin the slang style for the police
But bust this, no justice and no peace
cause it’s a stake off,
How’d that sound dirty coppers wanna clown,
had to have em capped, interrogated cause I’m Brown.

Out on the ghetto kicking it on the west side,
Piece of my hometown creepin of the old side,
Drive by status in the city of the free,
Popping out a clip drove by and had another allaby,
I was at a show, at a show,
so he did the job I don’t know,
Punk John Wayne’s pissed so he’ll harass my ass
Shining the light on my face  keeping my hands on the dash,
Now ask yourself what to do-what to do,
when a city like Pico runs wild on you
So we’re lost in the system cops trying to keep us down,
interrogated cause our skin is Brown.

On the corner pump the shit on my walkman,
One time creeps I don’t sleep cause they stalkin,
what am I to say, what am I to do,
I’m high as a kite and my breath smells like brew.
Mr Copper Mr copper should I run son,
because you’re quick to pull the clip off your gun son,
I’m not the type to go out like a dumb one,
Gaffle me up and lock me inside of your dungeon,
Get it on with torture chamber I suppose,
there’s a beanie on top my head and a ring inside my nose,
I never live it down, no never live it down,
interrogated, seperated cause my skin is Brown.

I remember the day I got roughed up,
The jura threw a jacket on the bank for a hold up,
wanted to know my identity,
so I looked into the eyes of my blue eyed enemy,
he tried to get me in the back seat,
I’m back -G-, because the cracker’s on the worksheet,
Then they had me in a choke hold,
Then snap, woke up and it was no joke
They had the billy club stuck in my side,
cuffed up in the back, they was glad I was alive,
Now it was time for the pigs to have some fun,
trying to get me to confess to a a crime I never done,
Since I was the victim of harrassment,
but in my hood the chota get they assed kicked,
Aztlan nation on the rise so check the sound,
interrogated cause I’m Brown

Spot light hits, the copters fly in the masses,
Bum rush the borders, the hell with the badges,
A-L-T and a lighter shade brown don’t give a fuck,
about a beige gate or a lime green truck,
One lil’ two little seven Aztecs,
smoking up the marble and sipping up ex-wrecks
the stage, ALT  let the funk flow,
rine stones, cowboys, it’s the low blow,
I’m gonna walk, I’m gonna talk,
I’m gonna stand on my own two and flair another tamahawk,
Another latin time bomb and I’m down,
interrogated with a lighter shade of Brown.

Interrogated cause my skin was Brown,
got me bound, hand cuffed, and shackled to the ground.
Said I didn’t have the knowledge to kick some facts,
So they sticking me this and they labeled me that,
Put a price on my head and said alive or dead,
No matter what the cost or the blood shed
So now its on-death in my face,
gotta set the pace so I can win this race
But as I’m running, run--still no end in sight,
am I on a fantasy land or on a joy ride,
into an unknown path-lots of panic,
my minds confused and I don’t understand it.
Door to door to a table with one light,
Me and one man interrogating me all night,
Round for round for round for round all night,
Interrogated cause my skin was Brown.

This is your captain once again. As we make our descent
into Los Angeles we hope you had a pleasant flight.
The weather conditions are clear blue skies at 126 degrees
and we’ll be in the terminal in less than 30 seconds.
Once again thank you for flying Death Row West.

[Moka Only]
Yeah, for the shorty stacks listening, we love you, Nowfolk

It was around this time that I found her
Short and dope, laying low like a flounder
The same as Goodtime’s stack got stuck
I luck with meeting her at a show and I’m thinking "yuck!"
Now "yuck" mean good in the ‘Folk terminology
The aftershow eating with her, no apology
Well four tail came next in, well there you know
Needless to say, for the next route I was like "Yo!"
With big plans for the short-term future
Me and you girl, we staying tight like a ?shoop?
And then ?shoop? the little incident with her
From my boy, instantly made the ??? with her
A year went by, communication ended
But in my mind it was like it just got suspended
And recommended to be mended, reapprehended
And this week I seen her and I think she did splendid
Three times dope though as she looked last summer
Just sizzling in 80 degree heat, and she keeps heating
Her little squishy heart melting
Good God a year ago, again, I hope that we can pull it off
She’s a boatride away for the weekend escapade
Rollin’ out there in the Battle Axe Escalade
For the yum yum lemonade critter I love
She put my back in the fade, yo it’s better than bud

[Chorus]
Short girl, I miss the get down
Let’s make a prop(osition) like it was made to, get down, get down, get down
Short girl, I miss the get down
Let’s make a prop(osition) like it was made to, get down, get down, get down

[Ishkan]
This this year old Beanpole like him a short girl
To hit me with the good hurt
Put a skip in my hood heart
My hairy dick like the strings on gui-tar
And when I meet her with the five feet toober
She already off to a good start
With the tiny feet and a fine pooper
Yeah, the ???? package that she gets looks for
I ain’t saying that tall girls ain’t slick
And I ain’t trying to like go dating this shits, but
?If sliders ain’t gonna go buy low gravity
got the whole slide for a homie like me?
We don’t see eye-to-eye, but fit right to freak
She’s made off many small angles and tight degrees
With generous extremeties to please
And she my sqeeze, she my Annie
Playing shortstop and
Remember that the nicest things come in small boxes

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
She’s shorter than Wayne
with more jazz than the whole ?Ken Burns? collection
No sort of a flame
Drained the power on my V-Tec
She constantly keep my tape in her t-deck
She in effect!

[Ishkan]
Short whoop make my knees bent
To dance cheek-to-cheek and taste where teeth been
Every inch in proportion
Come on do your thistle, with your whole thing so little!

[Moka Only]
A fiddle with the middle pieces laid back after love
With the squares spooning, with this tune in my head
Make the kettle whistle *whistle*
Full-tilt for the alarm fire, heart, melts, she’s short

[Ishkan]
Like four feet four, maybe more
I’m embellishing at the size of the shell she in
So celsius that’s July sweat
Small fry felt you quick
Now there ain’t no helping it

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
One more time!

[Chorus]

Ready in my ride, even though I’m always cruisin’

Laced with my jeans, bald head with the sag
White hat back with the black doo rag

[Verse 1]
It’s a MIA, you gon’ be Missing In Action
Bitch I’m grabbin’ and jackin’ then I bust in action
I mean they stealin’ from me and takin’ bread from my family
Head full ah distress I’m usually the wizard in this
Blood thicker than water, nigga watch what ya holla
Your title DOA if you get ticket to play
Families pray when you lay, hit you wid that AK
Anytime ah the day, my nigga fuck what you say
Make you swallow your spit, bitch for fuckin’ wid this
Cause I’ma raw ass bitch, and I’ma hard ass bitch
I’m the shit on the stain, I’m the car that you claim
I’m the weed that you smoke, when you feed it and choke
So please escape to my pimpin’ because yo ass gon’ be missin’
And it’s a DOA if you get ticket to play, nigga,
Who rock the pump and take the pain out,
I, I rock the pump and take the pain out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You think your knowledge is deep, then this wish was mine
Nigga wished a pause on yo hatin’, this a method of mine
That mean I’m standin’ to strong than to ever be faded
You niggas flip up yo hate and lay the real on the table
Understandin’ the Boss is like payin’ the cost
Wid yo mouth shot off and then yo body got tossed look here,
Bring me your anna instead ah spreadin’ your rumours
Because they spread like pumas, I don’t dig what ya shootin’
Bitch you locked in the game, steady searchin’ for fame
Lookin’ for some that money so hell yo life’ll maintain
But since you ain’t got shit, you can’t hate on a Bytch,
So put some dick in yo mouth and put yo cock on the house
You in the midst of a playa I’m talkin’ straight to you haters
My nigga will look you in your face and say no you can’t fade her
Cause they call me a bitch, I’m gon act like a bitch
Fuckin’ up niggas I hurt and I kick and I whoop yo ass like a bitch, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well it’s a must that does puttin’ haters to dust
You niggas always talkin’ shit but y’all ain’t ready for us
Some real niggas up in this bitch and we ain’t showin’ no love
I want shit in this game man I’m on a come up
Niggas don’t give a fuck who you be, what you claim, who been through
You niggas ain’t runnin’ shit but who you see in the mirror
You better get that clear hoe, before you bring it here hoe
And I ain’t takin’ shit from none ah you bitch ass niggas
Do not play wid me boy, do I look like a toy
Do I look like a game, that you plan to enjoy
Do I look like a bitch, that you treat like a snitch
Or do I look like a hoe, who’s got much ah that flow
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so nigga FUCK YOU!
Nigga HELL NAW!, so MOTHERFUCK YOU NIGGA!

Hook (2x)

[Verse One]
Chops burn the house down, we build it from the ground under
Run through your town, catch pounds and bounce like flubber
Hotter than a Stevie Wonder summer
Makin tracks to Spank that ass like thank you, can I please have another
A number of hip hop lovers listen to my disc and discover
The shit I write tight like hip huggers
Mines the type of rhymes to make your eyes bug out like Chris Tucker
Face turn the color purple like your name was Danny Glover
Makin amateurs shudder one by one, take a number
Call me Land O’ Lakes cause I’m the man that makes the butter
Ill repute makin chumps suffocate, months to recover
Full throttle, lay tracks and burn rubber
Your fool’s gold is gone and lost its luster (ha)
So now you wanna give me love, I got a special place for your lips to pucker
My brainstorms thunder, sucker run for cover
Mountain Brother with the wallet that says "Bad motherfucker"

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everybody got a mic, everybody got two tables
Everybody got a deal, cause everybody got their own label
But ain’t nobody bringin it like this, so yo
All y’all motherfuckers can open wide

[Verse Two]
Y’all need to exchange your mics for somethin else
See this ain’t purple rain but nobody digs your music but yourself
It ain’t nothin to me, I judge an emcee by hearin if what they say is raw
Not the guest appearances your label pays for
They put it out expecting miracles, but ain’t nobody hearin you
And them cats sold you leftover material
Y’all toys ain’t even Tickle Me Elmo, y’all Teddy Ruxpin
Last time I made some shit like that, disposed of it by flushin
Guess what ?fan, your style is need of a suntan
You only rapping cause you got rejected from a punk band
Magnificent butcher, the one man Butch and Sundance
You know who it is, see, my crew ain’t new to this
I say screw the music biz, cause most of my favorite groups
They either sold the fuck out or their label gave em the boot
Took your soul to the pawn shop, trade it to make a name for your troops
Hopin to make some loot, but only made your soup cause

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now see, playa please, talk like you makin cheese, you ain’t Wisconsin
I read your contract, you gettin jerked liked Navin Johnson
You rhyme about your clothes and jewelry, soundin like you suck meat
And past that, your raps is half assed like one buttcheek
Urinate in the talent pool, shallow plus a fool
From your rhymes, you can tell you took the little bus to school
Your weak thoughts sound like you allow money to dictate em
And plus, your beats sound like a kid made em when they was just playin
Made the mistake of not makin chops your producer
Try to play the big dog, now you’re sayin, drop the chalupa
So while you’re washed up like a loofah with no future
We singin We are the champions, no time for losers
And y’all so called independent ?staples think y’all a label
Makin CDs that ain’t good enough for holdin drinks on coffee tables
Listen to the shit you’re kickin, what was that, an exhibition?
You’re not underground, you’re just wack, know the difference

[Chorus]

[Krazy]
From the moment that I saw you that night
Only thing that kept me going was your vibe
One of those shows that didn’t seem to go right
Pointed you out told you to meet me at stage side

[Bridge]
I would have payed to just come and see you
The way that you dance love the way that you move
Got one of me need a poster of you
Your the girl that fits the picture in my mind

[Chorus]
Guess you don’t understand I’ll be you biggest fan
When I get off the stage tonight I wanna be your man
Now thankyou for wantin me but I need you in my life
If this night goes the way that I planned I’ll be your biggest fan

[Verse 2]
At the signing you was nowhere to be seen
An now I wanna see you more that you came to see me
I’m gettin nervous will I find the words to say
Now ain’t it funny it should be the other way

[Bridge]
I would have payed to just come and see you
The way that you dance love the way that you move
Got one of me need a poster of you
Your the girl that fits the picture in my mind

[Chorus]

[Rocky B]
Front row the rock spots a chic that don’t want his dough
But still loves his hits that the way to go
if I was poor or rich she wouldn’t let me go
Cause this
(krazy) chick is so damn getto oh (rocky b)
she wants to chill and roll wiv me
(krazy) backstage
(rocky b) and when it comes to blazing she can blaze all day
(krazy) she wants him for the many years
not the status that comes along with being famous

[Flava]
Hold up yo lemmie break this down
With only 8 bars its so hard to take the crown
I bin watching your style girl its bin a while
since I seen ya at the show cant wait to meet ya
And treat ya good do everything I should need ya
flava so bad got me touching wood
We could blaze it rearrange it turn the pages
and if we meet again I’ll forget about the wages

[repeat chorus x 2 till fade]

Hook:
Who’s that nigga in the fresh V-12?
Westside rolling with fat jewels
(You know it’s K-Dee)
Fa-Sho
(And ain’t nobody bad like me)
Fa-Sho

Verse 1:
I’m in the ghetto hall of fame
Man it ain’t no thang
So why you playin’ games, trick you know my name
Oh, am I talking loud?
What you talking bout?
And what you doing out, on my paper route (bitch)
You wanna know if we can still kick it
But can you help a young nigga get a meal ticket
Shit I can do better by myself
What’s happenin’? Every motherfucker I know is platnum (Westsiiiide!)
And ain’t nobody gonna sw-i-itch
And go broke for a b-i-itch
The westside is r-i-ich
So everybody get the d-i-ick (ha ha ha)
I sport Sonar on my wrist, the sun on my fist
Never share it, hoe you won’t inherit no karrots
Westside medallions, we got thousands
And a house full of stallions sayin’...

Hook

Verse 2:
The six hun, be makin’ run like stockings
Garenteein’ 24 K with enough ice to go skiing
Shine y’all (bling) fat rocks that’ll blind y’all
Nothing comes free, how many times must I remind y’all
Tricks taking me shoppping (what?) 
Shoes size 10 (what?)
Break a nigga off some ends, bald dubs for them Benz (what?)
A panda and a parrot want the lobster with the shrimp
They way the jockin’, keep my pockets swollen like a blimp
Smokin’ hemp, mashin’ low key with the windows tinted
Breakin’ they neck to see who in it
The game is implamented to the fullest
So nice, see me roll like dice
Whey they spot me on the g-o
Makes them all want to know...

Hook

Verse 3:
Baby please, got more cheese than Kraft
Singin’ autograph, leather coat like Shaft
Arrivin’ at the club, hit a false sub
Me, Ice Cube, Mack 10 and that nigga Dove (Westsiiide)
Parlyin’ like stars, Hennesy at the bar
No need to announce cause hoes know who we are
Then I see her freakin’, peakin’ from afar
How bizarre she remind me of something like R.(what)
Kelly, damn, ass shakin’ like jelly
Ready to be spread, open wide and dick fed
All on my niggys it wasn’t hard to detect it
Know she love criminals and wanted to get connected
Say no mo, and made our way to the door
Tip the valay, pull up Mercedes,
Hopped in, it’s goin’ down
Baby hold on, I can hear them in the line start to say as we rode on

Hook

Outro:
Ice Cube:
When you see K-Dee, throw up the dub (X4)
Incredible Dub S-C-G

K-Dee:
Irresistable bitch, let’s roll, get rich
Baby please, you ain’t shit without these (X2)

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I didn’t want to spill him, I only want his loot
I didn’t want to spill him but I had to shoot

[Young Lay]
Lawd have mercy on him, I didn’t want to spill him
I only wanted his loot but I had to shoot
As soon as he stopped I turned and locked the door
he reached for his gat
And get the pourin like bleach when I split splat
And on this jack I’m dialin on the cellular
Cudee’s in the lowest cuz hit ‘em with one and now they was
They tried to milk me so I pealed him quick as fuck
Cudee seen his brains and remains say you sick as the fuck
You know what’s up, and yea y’all know the deal
There go them niggas who tried to fandangle let’s untangle this
Sicc Set, loccest out, Black ‘N’ Dangerous
They never knew about my crew and how we came to this
Slapping niggas over the head with a gang of shit
Get respect, got a tech hollerin it’s the set
I’m constantly sweatin, rollers might be comin fast
Cudees, some money, a fifth of Remi with some bloody zags
Left him fast cause it was sheisty
Counted the cash and dropped the bitches by the spot
G paper ain’t nuthin to have me sneakin up on your daily block
and high as a kite
I cut your neck and nigga that’s your life

[Chorus x4]
I didn’t want to spill him, I only want his loot
I didn’t want to spill him but I had to shoot

[Young Lay]
Killin remains dealin phat livin off of caine
Even got you gat whole crew stacks and pack a mack
How cold are keys and just what have we
Young job schemin, and now we sewin up this whole street
Lounge with me and get y’all spot Sicc Set mack
Till you on the strip with gat and don’t want to get jack
It’s in his arms I’m not calm
The rollers on our dick and punk bitches know we got it going on
It’s in my blood I got love I told my homie run
Because the rollers might be comin bounce
And even though they saw you bounce
And even though your going down toss your g that quarter-ounce
Ruffed and cuffed him and now they fin to rush me
Shit, Lawd have mercy

[Chorus x4]
I didn’t want to spill him, I only want his loot

[Young Lay]
Shoot’em till he dies take his loot and ride
Who will be doing this shit in the mind of a lunatic
I came across a lot of homies who was nice guys
But some of these nicer guys is jackin in disguise
And hell of mellon G’s fuck this sprouts jealousies
And over debatin they got you hatin from the start
Just like that broken heart that homie leaded to another fantasy
Like showing them cops where we lounge at and where we be
Now when they see me they post up explode the turf G
Lawd have mercy

[Chorus until end with mixed vocals]

Acting pretty heinous, we’re all slaves til you unchain us
And you are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you’re way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I’ve created

On her forehead, I tattooed my name backwards
So when she looks in the mirror she sees her favorite rapper
I’m a stunt actor, first on Fear Factor
Eat spiders and hide inside of a trash compactor

Get smashed harder than Kardashian backdoor
Make me wanna smack whores in nuclear reactors
I’m all eyes; your girlfriend- she’s all fours
That means she’s a dog but got a face like a raptor

What a dinosaur, looking bad on her best night
Are you perfectly sure your woman’s not a transvestite?
That’s not nice- I’ve got bad behavior
Got ten years of labor for killing all of my neighbors

I used a light saber, thought I was Darth Vader
I made her dress up like Laura Croft from Tomb Raider
Dipped into the acid, kidnapped Ralph Nader
Hijacked a rocket ship and hid out in a space crater
Take a look at the data, obvious that I made a
Different state of mind for all the common denominators

Acting pretty heinous, we’re all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you’re way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I’ve created

I call upon Poseidon; spear you all with a trident
You say your mouth hurts?  Well it’s my lines, you bite em
I have the moxie to go- you can’t stop me
Knock your teeth out on the floor- it’s not hockey

No Wayne Gretzky, heck, you can respect me
Took it to the bank with a bouncer, they never check me
I’m not next to blow; I’m not an upcoming artist
I’m just a white boy who so happens to spit the hardest

Every song I make is just another credential
I’ma keep going cuz I recognize the potential
Quintessential to me to implode your cranium
Forget gold or platinum, I’m double uranium

Dictionary rappers see me and go back to Webster’s
I’m a bit of an expert, smarter than Poindexter
If you make one song- feening to sell big
You have a worse chance of fame than Kenan and Kel did

Acting pretty heinous, we’re all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you’re way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I’ve created

You rappers are laughable, edible and forgettable
You only get wet when I chew you up, it’s incredible
Not a laughing matter, this chatter is not humorous
The ways I make all of you dreams shatter are numerous

More bars than a cellular tower, my signal’s strong
Feeling even more powerful by the hour, what’s wrong?
I’ve scoured meteor showers for hours hoping to make it clearer
The only star I see is looking back in the mirror

I crack my ankles, my back, my neck and knuckles as well
And since my music is cracking you might be stuck on the shelf
Katy Perry got my cherry chapstick, it was magic
Pulling on my rabbit, we can go and make it a habit

She kisses girls but I don’t kiss boys
Lil Wayne can kiss Baby all he wants but I won’t do the same
I should refrain in case people take it as a diss
It’s not a diss, just naming the person that he kissed!

Acting pretty heinous, we’re all slaves til you unchain us
And your are an ignoramus if you want to become famous
I am underestimated- you’re way too overrated
I am just another product of the monster I’ve created
[x2]

[Intro]
Yeah..uhh..

Tell me is it my swag, the way I ride

Cuz a nigga simply Do The Damn Thing!
Tell these haters I’m gettin....

It’s alot of niggaz pissed cuz I hit they ho
But it wasnt my fault, the life I bought
She lookin at me wonder how much my jewels cost
I asked her was I fresh, she replied "yes"
Still captivated by the diamonds on my chest
I told her take a guess, couple for the watch, couple for  the chain
Girl I Do The Damn Thing!
Don’t forget the ring baby peep my swag
Got dro by the jar homie, I dont fuck with bags

Get Money!

I’m gettin that cheese, and thats why you niggaz hatin on me
See now I understand, I’m the mothafuckin man
Doing what I wanna to do, you doing what you can
Got my gun up in my hand, Cartier frames
Cost over a grand man I see every thing
I did it for the paper, but they gave me the fame
So in return, hey..Do The Damn Thing!
I aint here to stunt, I aint come here to floss
I just came to tell you niggaz I’m the mothafuckin boss
And if you wanna rap, it just might cost
You might win some, but yo ass just lost..

[Chorus]

[Bridge] 2X
Get Money!
Let em hate!

Ridin around with Miss Reece and them
When I’m in the groove, I can freak a tune 
I’m smoother than, alopecia skin -- HAHA!!

Like soap when I put my clothes on 
I’m jokin, but I be foamed out
And all she want is more bags, but all I want is more ones
I told her bring that money back, like all them racks is Nordstrom\xc2\x92s - Whoooooa~!

Locked up for double life like "What the hell?!"

[Chorus]

[HOOK: Fed-X & Dru Down]
Ok It’s, Murder!
Wid three holes in a beenie hat pulled down over my face
and I got some guns on my waist
It’s, Murder!
I come wid a goon squad mob that’ll hit and pop
knock you off ya feet and outta ya socks
Ok It’s, Murder!
Now tell me have you ever heard or seen
a nigga that get his back split and do some back flips
It’s, Murder!
I come wid them two-two twenty-fives them thiry-two thirty eights
forty-four forty-fives and then them nines

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
I’m a motherfuckin’ mobsta, nigga I don’t pop my collar
I’m in fatigues jumpin’ outta trees like wild koalas
In a choppah, poppin’ the pasta, movin’ that rocka
Choppin’ the block up in a topless Boxer boy
Heavy drama I’ll machete ya momma
And when it’s beef the K eat niggas like Jeffrey Dahmer
Hannibal Lector animal dismantle ya sector
After all hoe protectors pipes bust under pressure BITCH!
I’m on the block wid my CB scanner
If ya snitch ya get a one way trip to see D Banner
See me deep in Atlanta wid a sleazy bammer
Where Lil Flip and Banner still squeeze the hammer
When I air out the space it’s hard to breathe like asthma
Head in the backseat DVDs and plasma
Man I ride spinners y’all ride on adapters
Man you know it’s murder when I ride on a rapper

[HOOK]

[Verse 2: Fed-X]
Okay it’s murder haven’t you ever heard of the emperor
The beast the man in black is looking for the chief
If I’m a monster call NASA eat guns wid plasma
Tryna knock off the space dude turn me into space food
I pack a space guage that send you to the space age
Murder death kill a serial racker and steel
Black van no license plate,
Homicide on a white man God writes the fate
I pause and hit the gate I’m the guy to let him die
The knife to his throat it’s called Colombian neck tie
We hold him hostage no wheelchairs baby
The Don the kidnapper and I make ya family pay me

[HOOK]

   (Wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...

Very special...

   (Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...)

May I help you?
You need some new shit, I’m here to bless you
Got a style all my own, I’m nothing like the next crew
Good afternoon, now after me there will be none
No continue, no part two
For would be contenders easily saw through
Your value over there now how dare you
Attempt to even act or appear to
Service amplifiers with no fire
Quite frankly I’m offended at how you professed your perfection
But never meant to go on, now peoples let’s address it
Exactly how many times you buy an album
That leaves you even somewhat pleased, far too seldom
Thank you, hey yo welcome, I’m just a real deal’s fan
I keep no feelings inside, that’s how I ride, you know who I am
Distinctly, Mike Zoot, in the no-name suit
And the boots, classic butter, ever item under 50-loot
My fashion statement is basement
Brooklyn night crew with the lyrics you get laced with
A tasteless displays, un-cool, I just can’t see them used
Ain’t got no soul in there, no technique, no flair
I sabatoge your whole savoir-faire, as we go there
Let’s take you to the air, get this whole thing clear
Til one rhyme reappear
I be the winner by unanimous decision on the system
A sound boy killum
I’m the good scientist turned evil villain, just chillin’
If it sound good in the flow it’ll start illing
With the service and the lyrics, yo...

   (Wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   rhyming kills a raw beat...)

Straight service, cause uh...

   (Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...
   Wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   rhyming kills a raw beat...
   Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...)

Like for example
The other night around twelve thirty, or done
It was me and son, playing Tekken part one on Sony Playstation
We doing the all night bid up in the crib
I whooping his ass with this Bruce Lee looking kid
I’m using patterns and codes, catching high-tech rep
On tournament mode, damn near broke son’s neck
Then he hit the reset, but fuck those, it was time for that underground
So I turned off the Sony and turned up the sounds
And now I don’t recall the DJ, but none the less I’m checking it
Cause the last time I listened yo he played my favorite record
If the beats and rhymes is hectic god respect it
But nothing else can be accepted in my hip hop
Suddenly, my jaw dropped
From two bars of a bassline, then some more scratching
Followed by guitars some pianos, oooh that’s banging
I had to say to myself, then I said out loud
Simply because it was the bomb I took the tape off pause
Quickly came the hi-hat on the snare, well mixed
Build up all in the background, 8-oh-8 kicks
All falling on place with the near perfect timing
Then before I know it some stupid nigga start rhyming
So I’m listening, trying to ignore the style he’s stealing
Fake bob my head, I can’t lie, I can’t feel him
Must this happen every time, what’s the dealin?
Appealing to the mass, rapper’s ass all revealing can’t last
So please repause that grass, it’s fuckin’ up my vibes
And my tape deck, the speakers, as well as the cassette
My accent, on access so hear this well
Ain’t no dis, ain’t no beef, ain’t no gas, ain’t no gel
It’s just the beat was kinda stink, but the rhymes I couldn’t smell
For bigger nose, and I was diggin those too, til the rhyming on the song
Now get rid of those, you rap real wrong
So now I’m forced to turn you off and turn the Tekken back on

   (Wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   rhyming kills a raw beat...)

Straight service in cause uh...

   (Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...
   Wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga, wack nigga
   rhyming kills a raw beat...
   Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...)

Word up... Service.

   (Wack nigga rhyming kills a raw beat...)

Mike Zoot, EZ Elpee, GuessWhyld (we need the Service)
My man Collossal in the house
Ninteenth, every time, every year
Straight service on first...

Eleven...

[Verse 1]
She layin’ on the bed, workin’ the lingerie
Tellin’ me "daddy come here please I wanna play"
Baby let’s do it all day ‘til tomorrow
I can make you erupt like Mt. Kilimanjaro
Kissin’ on her navel got her ready and enables
Need to get up in her room make her feel like she able
To reach her decimal, satisfaction, it’s so everlasting
And baby wanna ride on me with no distractions
I’m speakin’ tongue to her body and she speakin’ back
I told her she was freaky she asked me to freak it back
I hit the bottom of her map she told me bring it back
Kissin’ her lower section givin’ her asthma attacks
She told me bring it up to see what I’m workin’ with
I started whispering in her ear just to flirt a bit
Started makin’ sex faces givin’ me the cute ones
I did that first stroke that’s when I knew

[Chorus] Jamillions
Whoa
I just can’t wait to get home I’m giving you all this lovin’
So take off all of them clothes baby let me control this session
Just lay your body close to mine I wanna hear you scream out
So let me explore you, let me control you, I’ll never let go

[Verse 2]
Sweat startin’ to drip, she bitin’ on her lips
Tellin’ me how she want it just like this
She scratchin’ on my back tellin’ me to go in deeper
Her legs shakin’ and her knees gettin’ weaker
And she runnin’ out of breath
So I slowed it up and then I started kissin’ on her neck
Take it slow and speed it up for a sec
Knockin’ the wall, breakin’ the legs off the bed
I’m doin’ magic how I’m makin’ her feel so ecstatic
I’m goin’ hard and throwin’ all the balnkets off the mattress
She goin’ crazy body shakin’ like she can’t take it
Havin’ seizures lookin’ at me givin’ love faces
I got her twitchin’ so right when I hit the spot
Grippin’ each other tight something like a mess a lot
And when I hit it good, she goin’ to sleep
All night long wettin’ up the bed sheets

[Chorus]

[Jamillions]
I must be driving Miss Daisy
Cuz girl you got me going all crazy
From the way that you move them hips
Let me take control, nice and slow
We’re making good love in between the sheets
Hot sex on the couch, when you’re out you’re my closet freak I know
I hear you callin’ me
So lay your body down
You give me that old school lovin’
Girl we gon’ do more than just touchin’
Take off them clothes and don’t rush it
I got whatever you need so baby count on me
So turn the lights off, let your hair down
Put the music on full blast
And you could be the story of my video
And I will never let go

[Chorus]

[O.C.]
Uhh.. yeah, yo
Touch not, what not, say what one would
Aim is to move not back but frontwards
Go set eye upon the prize, more soul, also
{"ladies and gentlemen"} pleasure’s all O’s
Most know, some might not, find it irrelevant
Age with wisdom, speak with intelligence
Switch pitch up, let’s see if hitters swing with it
Beat awkward, let’s see how many people cling to it
Different design, comin forth mixtures like
exit cartel used in excess OD
O.C. bonded for life with this
I come through, niggaz whisper "He nice with his"
Been that, always, nothin changed but the game
Now a buck eighty-five, hype five-eight frame
Bumrush y’all ain’t no retreat, it’s a wrap now
It’s a million muh’fuckers wantin to rap now
Some suck, others suc-ceed, some try hard
Most chance slim in the game to succeed
No sweat, found niche, now it’s a done deal
Truth to be said, reachin heights unreal

[Chorus]
{*"let it be known"*} {*"it’s the professional"*}
{*"you know my name"*} {*"O.C."*}
{*"Make the hard work look easy, fa’ sheezy" - Xzibit*}
{*"Professional" - Nas*"} {*"lyricist"*} {*"Here’s another classic" - Nas*}

[O.C.]
Back on the scene, seein things more clear
Regroup my thoughts with a gift and a prayer
Praisin me, fall through it, no acknowledge for the game
and the things in the past you brought to it
Writers commited felonies; sayin my name in vein
Cocksucker givin credit to lames
O.C. never fell short, fell victim
Fell off, or lost touch, nor tried to adjust
Trust me, put your bid in, I’m so driven
Fairwell to these other rap lames, good riddance
Who the FLUCK, WANT, WHAT?  Bleek posed the question
Look in my eyes, see my expression
None adolescent, hardheads never learn shit
‘til they ass get spanked and had a lesson
News at 11 top story
Ain’t nann muh’fucker out here got nuttin for me
Set pace flows on mark, once I sprint off the block
Heads start man I just can’t stop
Even on an off day, still a mad freak
Think twice ‘bout havin the nerve to ‘proach me nucca
{"Professional level" - Nas"} {"lyricist"}

[Chorus]
{"let it be known"} {"you know my name"}
{"It’s the professional""} {"O.C."}
{"Make the hard work look easy, fa’ sheezy" - Xzibit}
{"let it be known"} {"It’s the professional""}
{"Professional level" - Nas"} {"lyricist"}

[O.C.]
Yo... flesh of my flesh, you need not test
North, East, I’m really not impressed
He say, she say, cars, bigger baguettes
Just about played out muh’fucker now what’s next?
Gun talk, loud bark, nuttin but excess
Like the same bomb dropped every night by Flex
Give it a rest killer, your style all wet
All mushy like pussy after steamy hot sex
O.C. the truth, and so is my clique
No chi-chi mon apply when it come to this shit
You want faggot rap song, gotta look elsewhere
My gangsters insured like good health care
Believe me when I say it, take my word for it
Change gonna occur but I really can’t call it
So off we go while this nigga O flow
And hold on, cause the driver of the mission is a pro

[Chorus]
{"let it be known"} {"it’s the best lyricist"}
{"you know my name"} {"O.C."}
{"Professional level" - Nas"} 
{"Make the hard work look easy, fa’ sheezy" - Xzibit}

5/11/81 the day mama was screaming trying to release a demon
Push baby push the doctor keep repeating, he almost coming
I can almost see it (young Hogg)

[Chorus: Dallas Bloacker]
It’s all on you, no matter what you going through

For my soldier still some falling yeah you still around I’m a hold it down

[J Dawg]
Yeah it’s been a longtime coming reminiscing while I’m flipping on these 4’s trunk humming, diamonds pressing up against that wood grain wheel
Sometimes I still feel like this can’t be real
touch screen system got a hog feeling lazy
Drank ain’t up cosh so crazy, hoes blowing up my phone fuck uou pay me
A couple years bac they use to act like they hate me
Now when they see me they act like they want to rape me
Bitches so shady only let them eat my babies
Niggas ain’t no better I couldn’t even get a letter
Sittin in that Pen no friends, no cheddar
Came home to less I had when I was in there
Fuc it now I’m out here a nigga can’t win now
Naw My kind made to shine like diamonds
J DAWG young hog 1 of H Town’s finest

[Chorus x2: Dallas Bloacker]

[J Dawg]
Yeah and this the part that I dreamed of, I wish Pat was still here
Bac then it wasn’t’ clear, bac then we couldn’t see pain in the way
Too much pain in our way and we was stuck in our ways
Be straight, and yeah them dudes got paid
Even dough we earned them stripes, damn it cost you your life
You got me like, was it really worth it
Naw I want my nigga bac, death he didn’t deserve it
Shit and all reality is, he gone rest in peace homie I Love u 4 real
Yeah and I’m a mourn u till I join u again and
I’m a shine until death put my 4’s in the wind
I’m on the freeway smashing like I’m on the back streets
Tell the laws to eat a dic bitch this here 4 PAT
I’m smoking like a broke stove, drinking like a fish
Get at me J Dawg in the mix out the bricks nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
My Generation be wildin’
Like we was born desolate on a island
LSD hittin’ proper
Nigga like NZT, you can’t stop us
Gang move like we mobsters
Nigga drink Hennesey like a shotter
Free my niggas that’s locked up
Police always tryna come knock us
I’m backseat, blowin’ my drow
Undercover cop creepin’ on the low
I got a zip and the hash stashed in the gas tank
Hope the nigga don’t smell my smoke
I take a trip out to the fresh coast
Good pow, good weed move slow
I got a plate of the hash then I ship that fast
I’mma see that shit when I go home
Call that fresh direct marijuana
Only fuck with that potent product
They mad cause I switch the topics
Like I can’t talk ‘bout what I’m thriving
I’m eatin’ good in my hood
My niggas see me ear to ear smiling
I’m always high as a fucking kite
But my moshpits they get violent
Beast coast winners my gang
Keep a real tight circle, nigga, fuck through friends
Been around the globe, now I’m goin’ in a trance
Pay me for my shows on the road in advance
I’m fuckin’ with the hoes like my dough in the bank
Nigga aura on froze with the coldest of dank
See me trippin’ fuckin’ gold for my soul it’s a fact
Niggas steppin’ to me wrong betta’ know how to act
Lets go, lets go

[Bridge: Issa Gold]
Raised up deep in the beast
Had a first hand see to the war in the streets
Rely on gripping the heat
And they multiply by getting them kids
That’s why I’m speaking for peace
Cause niggas be dying over the beef
But please don’t fuck with the gods
You gon’ be surprised by what you gon’ get

[Chorus: Issa Gold]
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see

[Verse 2: AK]
Shades up in my face, like to be dolo and puffing my dank
Then I’m up and away to the top let my brain do the job
Then I’ll straight free your mind from them chains
Made them moves to L.A now you see me tho
I be off of sunset blowing reefer smoke
No this ain’t a contest, but I’m leading though
No one there to contest, leave ‘em leaking, yo
And I’m smoking the best comatose from my sack
Got a whole lot of sins but it’s still no regrets
Gotta wallet of ends and this shit just commence
I go hard with my friends make them business connects
Yea we stackin baguettes
Up in Fresno and fresh
Get your ass off the bench I’m in class with the feds
Hol’ up , flex
I’m the living lord in the flesh
Got next and when a nigga on cortisol [?]
They lookin at me like the lord savior is coming
I spit fire like I’m Hades when they play me they bumping
If I retire then my bars become the greatest among you
They trying to say newcomers, but we displayed that we run this
You can’t tame my soul, can’t change my goals
My wheels take me how far I go
Y’all niggas get fleek with no apartment though
Up in your momma home, with your designer on
Spark one and then I takeoff
Cause the coast, homie, travel be my dayjob
And I’m coming for that globe like I’m Adolf
Super high, like a giant smoking beanstalks
And we sipping mad gin like we’re detox
Syrup in my liter
[?]
Queens step up in my 2-seater
You can follow preacher, but nigga I’m a leader
I’mma smoke this reefer and pass it off to Issa

[Bridge: Issa Gold]
Raised up deep in the beast
Had a first hand see to the war in the streets
Rely on gripping the heat
And they multiply by getting them kids
That’s why I’m speaking for peace
Cause niggas be dying over the beef
But please don’t fuck with the gods
You gon’ be surprised by what you gon’ get

[Chorus: Issa Gold]
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see
My niggas gon’ bang, bang, preacher gon’ sang
Come pull up my nigga and see

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
My team loyal, no counterfeits
Fraud niggas can’t fly with them
Taking off no pilot in
Yo high in it, the young Zionist
My nigga wait, finna be great
Every time I drop a song, oh my Lord, they relate
And a nigga, we strong like it’s gon’ hit the weight
Tell these niggas keep up like they joggin’ in the place
Usain Bolt to the dough
A nigga been lucky got my ducks in a row
You see me dream big, do them out in the smoke
Only talking business if you contact my phone
Nigga in the zone, ain’t fucking with the clone
Y’all niggas move slow, better leave me alone
If you ever hit my phone, nigga gon’ get the tone
Of a motherfucking drone when I bump my ringtone

[Verse 4: AK]
I’m a first place winner, earthquakes when I enter
Then they [?] for my [?], first date then I’m in her
Oh Lord, how dare a nigga wanna come test the god
Testify, nigga touch the sky
Put a nigga under six feet
I said, put a nigga under six feet
Young AK only here to bring peace
But that shit out the door, fuck it with the family, my g
Hold up, wait, I got all this cake
But still ain’t shit changed, my brain don’t inflate
My L’s ain’t from games, it’s from all this dank
Until the bed of pain to the ninth time straight
Talk shit, hit a nigga with a mic on stage
Mosh pit, something silly nigga, straight to his brain
From the prince of the gutter to the top game pay
Now you pissed that they coming through, you stuck in the shade

[Skyzoo]
Dark grey at the bottom of the wall
Light brown in the background, twenty stories tall
Blue and orange for the welcomin’, letters on the draw
Need another can of brown and a yellow for the star
Use that for the awning, Save some for the morning
Put it above the buildings, but shade it to show the dawning
White tee corners with blue and whites upon ‘em
Brown paper stash in grey sewers support ‘em
Purple tops is down
Purple pouches are crown
Black leather Bibles, gold robes and gowns
Green and white dice games
Charcoal calibers
Silver hops out and burgundy the parameter
Running through burgundy cans
I can’t keep one
Try paintin’ that high up, but I can’t see none
Red and black J-O’s
Hands on the payroll
Stephen Strasburg your curve, let a base load
Navy blue rent-a-car
Trunk pop, lift it off
Black duffle bag
White K’s, clear signatures
Huh, marathons when the signals drawn
Green Newport boxes could make a finger tug
No innocence turns to more innocence
Paint it yay high
And see if it grows into it
Still trying to find the colors of how the growth looks
Black and white marble color notebooks

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
(My graffiti)
Somethin’ like FADE, somethin’ like DAZE
Somethin’ like IZ, somethin’ like SLAY
Somethin’ like SEEN, somethin’ like Qui\xc3\xb1ones
Colors everywhere when I throw this
See that?
Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
I be Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans

[Skyzoo]
Eggshell for the door that she led him to
Gold for the bracelet he wore that helped get him through
Green eyes got her using every trick she ever knew
Locked on whatever, like whatever he should ever do
Shit is all worth it, driven off a purpose
Dark blue for the Dereons that she curved in
Purple sidekick, fly bitch on her home screen
Tanned Gucci bag off of everything a blow be
Fifty for the wop, a hundred for the walls
Saying fifty’s a lot, but her tongue is like an applause
and money right from the door knew what it was goin’ be
She hit him with what it’d cost
He hit her with all he need
Black for the Mag box, tickling her stash spot
Grinning off the image, said the pussy like a padlock
Beige for the unroll
Shorty told him pump slow and she could take it from there
Sweet dreams, drumroll
Duke said "nah," and started spazzing in her hips
Hands on her throat, went savage off the rip
Red for the way the room looked when her eyes closed
Screamin’ that rape shit from behind a blindfold
See no evil and hear no evil
Can’t walk unless your sure of where the stairs goin’ lead you
Looking for a color that could help those jogs
Like a green and white MetroCard, huh

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
(My graffiti)
Somethin’ like FADE, somethin’ like DAZE
Somethin’ like IZ, somethin’ like SLAY
Somethin’ like SEEN, somethin’ like Qui\xc3\xb1ones
Colors everywhere when I throw this

Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
I be Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans
Krylon heavy, I’m heavy on them cans

Intro: (*lady singing*)

It’s goin down, liqour store
Must go down, goin down

Bouncin to the liquor store
Bout to purchase me a forty-O
Liquorice types, bootleg tape
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT
Bill, blowin me up, Holly go and say the limo pickin me up
Now I got the plans, the freaky fans, finishin up
The wash, the wax, the chrome on my *?doc-top ride?*
Oh you know, we just, hangin
Niggas hit me up, paintin my fingers from all this star bang-in
Men-tal on the ward, give someone a gun
Pull out a philly and he can pack himself
????? ????? and J-Dub shootin dice with the rest of the brothers
But I’m on TV breakin y’all motherfuckers
E’rybody gonna get some of that light
when they mobbin to the liqour store

Chorus:

Everybody’s gotta get some light
(Mobbin to the liqour store)
Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run
(Mobbin to the liqour store)

Yeah
But I ain’t even there yet
Cos there’s still some more spots I’m gonna hit
Like that brick house on the corner, I’ve been lovin it a long time

And I’m almost to her house and thangs
Seen em, chasin em, Lil’ Jase servin em *?tump?*
Hey, I know I’m gettin closer
Peepin the homies, y’all sellin dope
And all of my pimp and hustlers
(Are we all closer, yo?) Yeah, waddup?
How bout lettin me hit those skins and then I’m gonna cut
I’m on my way to your mom’s store, I gotta show
And me and Miss Sushi, ‘ock you out about the dizzough
Sun is beaming, ‘96 summer
Aiyo Freeze, you got the beamer and my Camo
Aight you motherfuckers, everybody, gonna get some of that light
when they mobbin to the liquor store

Chorus (x2)

In the liquor store
Now I done purchased me a forty-O
Liquorice types, bootleg tapes
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT
Vigo, fill some more, by the bread rack
My persona out the door, my ????? in Prada wanna grab her a gat
But e’rybody gonna get some of that light
when they look in the liqour store
for the sure dough, double-stitched, sock
For the real neat team, never forgettin its knots
Hops, we be on some ol’ hacknin, a whole packet of rubbers
And a video never play me unless it’s murder
You got my skrilla, but shit I want all the shit
I don’t know about my homies, maybe them fools is been

We had their back, that doesn’t mean no loss
Somebody bout to set it off again

Chorus: (x4)

Everybody’s gotta get some light
(Mobbin to the liqour store)
Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run
(And I’m about to make a liquor store run)

Siah: 98, S-I, what
Yeshua Da PoED, check it

Siah:
Riding the beat
beats walking on the street
I can hop a train
and move in that vehicle
but the metaphor is better for traveling quick
to any destination and any location
in the known universe of my imagination
confined in a verse
I’m a powerful combine
who got to bomb minds like a war flick
on time when my jaw spit raw shit
hella fit,halibut,had to fit
grab a chalice to sip, then slip
through the sands of my ‘cholosis(?)
S-I not the V
I’m in the place to be
still swinging on vines in the tree
I don’t want to be distraught, more overjoyed
rather be caught in a void, nullify
What if I delve a blade
I left my sickle at the airport cuz I felt sick
Whether you felt it or not
I don’t give a shit
But if you leave it on the shelf then it might get spoiled
Take it to health, Lord knows I toil
now unemployed, never employed as a decoy
unless it’s so
Yeshua Da PoEd can blow the spot, blow the spot (fade)...

Yeshua:
Now all cats who ain’t prepared, beware
all I need is the pair of kicks,a snare and his dare
for the taking
hall with my statements, to hell with all the waiting
sort of breaking a spell
you can tell
what I’m making is fail safe
Laced at a pace to digest
cuz all the tracks I bless got me rhyming slow
and I’m in no
hurry, worry, my flow was to fat to wrap
I plan to drop pounds
I came to explain hip-hop sounds
simple and plain (simple and plain)
If you’re not down, yo man
get down with the program
or at least the flow release Yeshua Da PoED
from the east coast, don’t mean to boast
but an MC like me is what the world needs most

Chorus:
S: From night til morn
Y: Dusk til dawn
S: Yo, injected with life
Y: Cuz we must live long
S: Traditions that I strive to carry on
Y: Get cut on a plate and end up in your crate
(repeat)

Siah:
Not feeling precise, I got a healin’ device
It’s called a walk-man, on track
bettin’ that I get back home around midnight
caught up in mid-flight
my dim light, did like, hit me with insight
When all is the same, and I remain content
not a need to repent, let it out like a vent
What I meant is a youth parism(?)
self in my self is the proof
but no convoluted truth
Just a simple rebuke
got me sittin’ in this composition
on a mission to find revenue
I never knew that it was necessary
Reality can get scary, but I
parry and thrust with the best of us(sets of us)
nuts and chops(?)
I knock minds with rhymes
and the cuts that I drop can stop time on a dime
If I was truly wise, then I would shut the fuck up
Still waitin’ impatient for life to catch up

Yeshua:
It took more than the luck of the draw
to put my foot up in the door
It coulda been cause and effect
Styles I studied before, often reflect
Too bad the cats that taught it the best, got caught in the net
Now I’m in effect
You see, I quit my job to become full-time MC
When I’m full, rhymes empty, till I reload
skills I will stow
in the form of flow
till ya know
the D to the A to the Po-E-D
When I spray, ya gonna belive me
I rep the Wee Bee
Foolish to truest form, no matter what track
I do this on
Crews get on, guess who get dropped
(Guru sample) "Cuz they have no regard, for real hip hop"
I don’t stop,yeah yeah
I don’t don’t quit
Yeshua Da PoED guaranteed to be the ultimate
(Like that)

Chorus

Like that
Unsung heroes
Si and Yeshua

[Intro]
Yeah yo yo what time the plane leavin?
Ahhh alright, I’ll see you at the airport
{*samples of "r-r-r-r-rock on"*}

[Chorus]
Memories don’t live like people do
They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, its just the memories

Memories don’t live like people do-o
Baby don’t forget me, I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time
Gotta lotta things i got to do
God willin’ I’m comin back to you
My baby boo

I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time (space and tiiiime)
Gotta lotta things i got to do
But God willin’ I’m comin back to you
Baby boo
I’m leavin

[Verse 1]
Well go ‘head and leave
The call heard ‘round the world from the wives of MC’s
These cats is playin more than half a pound
My garment bag I snatch it down
Ain’t got the state but we could prob’ly run a blacker town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC, i.e. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhymin’ no different from coal minin’
We both on assignment to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin’
And then I start shinin’
You be strugglin’ and strivin’
And they think you prime-timin’
Maintain and keep silent, make note, an observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
‘Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation cause this ain’t no recreation
This is Pro Ball!
And we lettin you know y’all
At the show y’all
Doin’ this for dough y’all
Get the phone call
And I’m ready to blow y’all
‘Bout to go y’all
Been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m lettin’ you know that...

[Chorus]
Memories don’t live like people do
They always remember you
Wether things are good or bad, its just the memories

Memories don’t live like people do-o
Baby don’t forget me, I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time
Gotta lotta things i got to do
G-d willin I’m comin back to you
My baby boo

I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time(space and tiiiime)
Gotta lotta things i got to do
But in time I’m comin back to you
Baby boo
I’m leavin

[Verse 2]
But God willin’ I’ll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalog of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin, been away for that long
But no you haven’t well least that’s how it seem to me
My home town is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the bar smokin greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it but its sweet scented
When you been down for a minute
Move around city limits
Break it down with the vintage
The innovative
Classical B-Boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause that’s the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cakalaks
Cali in the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia State
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let’s set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Minasan, like everybody out in Nippon
Say ichiban, may God have well where you’re getting from
Phenomenon, ‘scuse me that’s a phone call
Its the show y’all
Tryin’ to get this dough y’all
‘Bout to blow y’all
Been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m lettin’ you know that...

[Chorus]
Memories don’t live like people do
They always remember you
Wether things are good or bad, its just the memories

Memories don’t live like people do-o
Baby don’t forget me, I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time
Gotta lotta things i got to do
But in time I’m comin back to you
My baby boo

I’m a travellin’ man
Movin through places, space and time(space and tiiiime)
Gotta lotta things i got to do
But G-d willin I’m comin back to you
Back to you

I’m leeaaavvvvinnn’!
I’ll be back to you
I’m leeaaavvvvinnn’!
I’ll be back to you

All over the world we go
DC all over the world we go
VA all over the world we go
The ?Cakalaks? all over the world we go
London all over the world we go
Japan we go over the world we go
Paris we go over the world we go

{*beat playing in background and samples of "r-r-r-rock on"*}
1-2, 1-2...All aboard!

(So you wanna be a gangsta)\t\t--> Too $hort

Nah like no gangsta, nah like no gangsta, come again
Nah like no gangsta, nah like no gangsta, follow me
Nah like no gangsta, nah like no gangsta, because
When I was a youth, just a little youngster
Gangsta killed mi mother and killed mi father
They kill my sister and kill mi brother
Bo! bo! and them get shot down
Bo! bo! and them get shot down

Never given a chance to enhance 
And advance to the mic stand
Because of the craft and the path of a state pen
The thought of if white being black is a syllable
Beginning at birth, yeah, I begin at the physical
The scenery’s grim, fakes float like phlegm
I keep the G to myself, made a vow, no friends
Cause people you trust, all lies and propaganda
Slick man slander, talk like Sandra

( *to the beat of Kris Kross’ ‘Jump’* )
Fake one, wanna-be, clocked, your dead ass knocked
Shell-shocked, two shots, heart’ll be your next stop
Weak mouth leak out, smack what you breathe out
Now whose fault when it’s hard, get your knees down
You cheat, got a new trick cause that’s what you do
When you’re in jail zero got more stuff than you do
You wail like a ( ? ) and echo the vicinity
Can’t handle the time cause the judge gave you infinity
Life, that’s what you get for your everyday hustle
Ropes and a handyman couldn’t pull your luck up
Wanna be the trigger figure, critter with the Tec
Banned for tryin to ( ? ) your mom’s neck
You couldn’t get a ( ? ) for that stuff you yell out
Killin your own just to make bones, now that’s a sell out
But who’s the bigger pussy, just like a panther
I’m just lettin you know - so you wanna be a gangsta

( *to the beat of Cypress Hill’s ‘Hand on the Pump’* )
Wanna-be gees try to be what they can’t be
Cause what you can’t be you try to be cause you’se the wanna-be
So play the back like a fallback, in the back
But way back before I break your muthafuckin back
And my foot off in your ass if you don’t step off
Cause when I go off I sound like a sawed-off
So stop actin like you’re packin a Mac ( ? )
And gangsta rap ain’t what’s happenin
And that means you and you, know what you can do
If you don’t like what I’m sayin, but in the meanwhile fuck you
I’m ( ? ) so save the killer talk and just walk
Before I walk all over your ass just like a sidewalk
You ain’t got nothin comin but a bad break
So why try, you fry, that’s a big mistake
On your behalf I told you you couldn’t last
But the thought that I was trickin, now guess who gets the last laugh

( *to the beat of Ice Cube’s ‘My Summer Vacation’* )
8 down brothers on a prison tip
You wanna be a gangsta just swingin the clip
You come to Rahway, you be suckin my dick
After a little whille I make you my bitch
I’m not a [edited] and I don’t like ( ? )
While you’re sittin in a leather chair gettin your ass fired
There goes the prison, there goes the prison

( *to the beat of ( ? )* )
Niggas that life to riff but don’t really have the gift
I come across because my style’ll switch swift
Criminal background, I can go underground
Pound for pound every lyric I throw down
Cause this is a showdown, suckers I mow down
They rush like ( ? ) when I go ( ? )
One by one, come all or plenty
Cause when I do a show, boy, I kill many
Weak punk rappers, camouflagin fakes
I’ll down a sucker and I won’t be late
Come back and translate the jams I elevate
Now watch me operate, see how I demonstrate?
To all deceivers a make-believer
Your falsing trickery is no longer mystery
And if you want bitchery, and if you want bickery
And if you want victory, just try to get with me

To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)

To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)
To be an O.G. (you had to be an O.G.)

( *to the beat of the Geto Boys’ ‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’* )
I’m the M-a-x-w-el-l
Swiftmaster, sucker, now that spells Maxwell
And what I kick here ain’t just another fairytale
I wrote this shit so others wouldn’t have to
Go through the things that Max had to
I know a many of gangsters on the street
Some in a jail cell, the others six feet deep

( *to the beat of King Tee’s ‘Played Like a Piano’* )
Holdin your breath when I mess with the mess rap
You coulnd’t get jack but a backsmack, none cap
Flackin that flack while there’s ( ? ) talk bull
Comin to battle with a rattle, havin no pull
( ? ) and boot-lickin, kickin your bullshittin
Jack in a box ( ? ) your face-splittin
Servin up lumps to your ( ? ) you wanna ( ? )
Rather duck ( ? ) to get ( ? ) you duck none
Mister blister, dismiss, kiss the
Head on my nine, not a crime to kill a bigger nigga
Critter-digger, trigger mouldin your head figure
Little bum you’re ( ? ), I leave that ass rid of
Asshole, Lord knows what I wrote ( ? )
Kick one lifetime and it’s time to hold
More grounds than the bounds of a highway
Cause I say it my way, ah fuck it in Rahway

* first single; send corrections to the typist

Slowly and steadily MC’s are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we’re paper chasin’ for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don’t snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

[Chorus]
So MC’s, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ’s pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I’m punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i’ll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC’s
I feel theres only a few tenants who’ve been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I’m smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

[Chorus]
So MC’s, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ’s pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I’m shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can’t feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase "i keep it real"
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I’d rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I’m never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin’
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don’t mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I’d like to pump em’ with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they’ll manifest
Check the blueprint...

[chorus]
So MC’s, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ’s pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

[Dr. Ama]
Another homey slain, look like it’s gonna rain
Ride out in homey’s name, hustling’s a lonely game
Guess it’s a hood thing, a bad and good thing
Off to a better place, so I got this wetter face
Gangstas be congregating, create the cypher
Always wanted two niggas out the way, hyper
Two tokes that tell the cess smoke, pull out the XO
To memories we made, never let go
Thirsty to find them niggas, pull triggers and let go
I’m vexed yo, so you stop fucking with them clown niggas from get go
Let the old tech blow, uphold your name
These days it seems real dudes up and sold ya game
Snitches deceiving, still living and breathing
What are we achieving? Moving ass backwards
Proving ass niggas, got this? That’s a no-no
Rewind time in my mind, play it back in slow mo

[Chorus: Dr. Ama (Scooter)]
Fallen soldiers, life’s not over, in our hearts
(You still live) you live through me
We in the club, popping bub, to your memory
(And you still live) you live through me
From the V.I.P, to the day I rest in peace
(You still live) you live through me
Bigging your name up, raising the thing up
Banging the thing what? Forever claim ya

[Vexe’d]
Pour out expensive liquid on the V.I.P. carpet
Roll up the haze and spark it, for you, I’m gonna live it
Prison and grave visits, make it the hardest
Things that we did, made an artist
So I peace off ya kids, your old earth and your wiz
If it was me, I know you do the same for prezzy
But you got me out here, lonely, missing my homey
To change my thoughts, I gotta go O.T.
Cause our time reminds me of we, and that can’t be
Damn, nigga, this can’t be
Life without my co-d, why was I set free
Maybe, so I can speak, teach and reach, atleast
O.N.E., yeah, man, I be happy
Young gods, playing with odds, that’s not crappy
Push stars, playing with cars, that was you and me
It seem so long ago, I bust a four
To the sky, it’s either that or cry, rathed make the metal
Hollow then wallo, I rep for Mookie, J Peace, Sterling and Psycho

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Ohana Bam]
Get down, get down low
You know how that go
You gon’ drop it to the floor
But you know how that go

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
‘Sup bitch, ‘sup hoe
Good game, cut throat
Shawty say that she love thugs oh
She better say no names if she got cuffs on
Lately I just do it for the fuck of it
I line it so sharp that it’ll cut a bitch
If it’s Henny then of course I’ll take a cup of it
Good luck getting me to give a fuck again
In, out and in out of state
I’ve been eatin’ good, never been out of shape
But I’ve been out and sent out some bitches with weight
Better get out the pen now and print outs the pay
I be in out and in out and in out of planes
I don’t trip out but trip out to get out of lane
Bitches hating on me, better sit down and wait
Better get out cause this round gon’ hit y’all and spray
Bitch get back before I blocka
You a bad bitch, I’m a bad motherfucker
Tell the valet bring the keys, bring the truck up
When you talk to to me you better stand up and look up
Hoe get back cause I’m back now
Top producers bringing A1 tracks out
We about to make these motherfuckers black out
Mamacita make and bake and makin’ cash now
Get down low

[Chorus: Ohana Bam]
Get down, get down low
You know how that go
You gon’ drop it to the floor
But you know how that go
Get down, get down low

[Post-Chorus: Ohana Bam]
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, get down low

Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, get down low
Get down, get down low

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Snow-ee-yo I spit that hot fire
If you ain’t heard you got a cross wire
You ain’t been on no shit that’s not hard
You ain’t gettin’ no cake sweetheart, that’s pop tart
You don’t got it down like moi
When I spit bars, leave ‘em all in awe
Five foot tall but the aura large
And in charge, I’m a boss, we get broads like God
Little mamcita got a lot of grip
They be noticing I be talking ‘bout economy
Have you seen the Mexicana with the dollars in
And I get the cheese, I ain’t lactose intolerant
So follow me when I get out bags and get out masks and, uh
Get out gats and get that cash and run
Hit that gas and hit that armored truck
Just sit back and flip that in a month like whoo!
Ain’t I tell y’all I’m here
Ain’t I tell y’all I’m runnin’ up and bustin’ on ‘em
Ain’t I say this my year
Ain’t I tell y’all I’m coming up and stuntin’ on ‘em
Cause I’ve bene on the phone closing deals
I’ve been talking ‘bout how we gon’ flip and we gon’ spend it
I don’t care if I’m a go legit
or if I’m a come in a ski mask, bitch I’m a get it
Look, get down, get down low

[Chorus: Ohana Bam]
Get down, get down low
You know how that go
You gon’ drop it to the floor
But you know how that go
Get down, get down low

[Post-Chorus: Ohana Bam]
Get down low, all the way to the floor

Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, get down low
Get down, get down low

Chorus x4:
Don’t trust anyone
Ain’t no one we can trust
  
Verse 1:
I wanna take it from starts and scrapes
By high bars and gates
This stars atapes
Hungry niggas that’s thug-relate
Money-getters sniffin yards of yay
Honey-hitters gettin charged all day
R.I.P. to B.I.G. and Marvin Gaye
Cause life’s beyond critical
So I can’t be seen wich means I’m non-visible
Son your aim with a firearm’s pityfull
You hit the wrong man and left his mobs miserable
Criminals usin this moment to show
What we distributin is potent
My ludacriss slogans be havin shorties brutally copin
I keep my pay collected and stay connected
To get niggas to play my record 
And my name respected is the main objective
I’m leavin foes crushed with no points
On a dole night
I’m so nice
Niggas that play heroes I give ‘em cold cuts
Adolescents packin Wessuns
With solid crack professions
He die from the mack’s agression
Instead a black depression
  
Chorus x4
  
Verse 2:
Well if you thinkin what I said was soft
Watch the lead bust off
And have you runnin like a chicken with his head cut off
You’re number one opponent
Make sure them guns is loaded
Before you find your sons extorted and unsupported
If I’m not firin, I’m gettin higher yeah
Motherfuckers is better off retirin
And playin violins on isle-lands
You’re admirin my style cause it’s quite vicious
Smack bitches like niggas smack niggas like bitches
Doin time for crime and facin
Now your mind is wasted
For tryin to shine with diamond bracelets
Mad flavour, the bag lacer
Take a pull of this
Shit have you feelin like a dragracer
Notice me, you ain’t supposed to be attackin
On global and locally I master it
Lyrics is vocally immaculate
niggas is totally inaccurate
Packin iron for wreck
A lot of these niggas is dyin vervexed
But son, imagine havin lions for pets
Smokin cess
Fuckin any bitch you try to sex
I’m thinkin long term, more than just byin a Lex
I want the livest connect
With each man in my fam high as the next
  
Chorus 8x
  
Business is business
And even your peoples are playin for pape-papes
So many snakes, punk bitches and fakes, snitches and jakes

.

I wish I had alot of money {money}
I wish I had alot of women {women}
I wish that wasn’t a typical rappers ima-a-age
I wish that people would really listen
I wish that this life we live in, was for the free and not the richest
I wish I had no spending limit, I wish that there were no tickets
I wish that cops were apprehended 
Or even better yet non existent for the shit they make us deal with
I wish the government would pay attention
I wish for politics to make a difference
I wish the media would tell us real news, and not what the fuck is trending
I wish that we could find out who shot pac and big, it’s about time my nigga
I wish that I could be anything I wanna be and travel over seas
I wish I had financial security for my family
I wish I didn’t have to rely on this dream
I wish I could see better days, I wish for a lot of things
I wish it all, was as easy as it seems...

{Hook 1:11}
I wish they co-o-ould understa-a-and
I wish they co-o-ould understa-a-and
Bu-u-ut, I kno-o-o-ow/
Nothing is the way it should be
Man this shit is cool but, it aint what it seems

(Shaka Loc)
Blinded, by the way of the Locs, the haters hold to
Extinguish the flames, and blow the roof off with smoke
Whether or not it’s West Coast, it’s Mad Man fa sho this
Notice the raw talent, technique, but not no hits
Critics crack frowns for holdin’ the town down
I’m mad now, just so sick of the same sound
Formed a method and kept it, use it as a weapon against you
Bionic issue, to raise above the role of officials
Chronic fatigue
Flossin’ for nil, innate hatin’ chromatic emcees
I’m chasin’ faces of Satan
Waitin’ on Daytons, debatin’ whether or not to shoot for the stars
You know who you are, but you can’t keep on jabbin’ the jaw
I worked too hard, everyone carries a bucket of blood
From the sweat glands of a Mad Man, there ain’t no love
So bizarre, drownin’ in a lake called "Hate"
Shaka Loc and Nefarious without a debate

(X-Raided)
Right before I bark like a mastie
With lines harder than mastic
Spit rhymes like bullets, swell up your chest like mastisses
I’ve mastered this rap scene
Blasted every wack cat I’ve seen
I’ve got the best flow, no match for this West Coast rap King
And that’s fact, not fabricated
Black Market advocated
With rhymes to substantiate it
It’s fine, avidly hated
When I rhyme tragically premeditated raps should be segregated
Wack emcees and emcees with skills should be separated
Debated in Hip-Hop Senate
Empeach all Record label Presidents releasin’ as many wack acts as No Limit
No critic is bein’ critical of their pitiful releases
I’m Siskel and Ebert, two thumbs down, rippin’ you into plentiful pieces
Spit this thesis to the drug pound, flood the mic in a receptacle
On stage, holdin’ my testicles, speakin’ in tongues like a processional
You’re facin’ inevitable spectacles steppin’ to me
Your mid-section’ll be crampin’ like it was stretchin’
When a professional wreckin’ the beat
Tears second to me, we all for total domination, COMPLETE
Vocal abomination can beat
With niggas like shootouts in the streets
Verbal automatic release at least a hundred rounds per discharge
In hordes, who else you expect to come this hard?

[Chorus 2X: X-Raided + Shaka Loc]
(X-Raided) Shaka Loc they playa hatin’
(Shaka Loc) And we’s aware of this
(X-Raided) Cuz what we spit is devastatin’
(Shaka Loc) And we’s aware of this
(X + Shaka Loc) Beware of this, Shaka Loc and Nefarious we terrorists
(X-Raided) Fake killas be hesitatin’
(Shaka Loc) And we’s aware of this

(Shaka Loc)
Dispicable scrutiny, interrogated and major hated
Strapped across a table unable to illustrate it
Certified Mad Man, made man, the script, the blue prints, the big hits
Yearly annual licks
Get my driver to stop it, the Planet must burn first
Shatter Earth with terrorist acts, it’s the block or the turf
What makes it worse, is I ain’t gotta lay down to hurt you
The verbal tec shells full of virtue (you better feel me)
To kill me, all slowly while we sleepin’
So watch for the heat-seeking scuds while you’re creepin’
Been peepin’ out the wicked ways on how you be handlin’ business, Midget
Done focused in on how to get the digits, and did it
I broke down my heat in pieces
Now chronicalistically speaking, you should have no liking for this thesis
Point blank, the bottom line not to understate this project
Cuz where we at you’z about to wreck

Chorus (.5x)

(X-Raided)
We deadly, quick to perpatrate like they want to confrontate
DJ’s honor Raided
I serve emcees to get exonerated
It’s on to me, that rap that your Mama hated
Cuz I created rhymes about jackin’ and comin’ after ya
Doin’ things that’s crime related
I’m related to all killas, all thieves, and G’s
Got lyrics in my genes, my Grandma breeds emcees
Like Dogs, say "Sic Him", I hit him, and split him at the seams
Go for the jugular, muggin’ ya like a New York City scene
I smother ya like a Mother that doesn’t want her kid to inhale
Tortorous abortion, bodily forcin’ you into Hell
Snortin’ and exhale fire like medieval dragons
We evil Mad Men, for hire we leave people in trash bins
Leap with ferocity, X-Raided will shock all these trash rappers
Leave your track with gashes like it was attacked by velociraptors
I’d be at them platinum ones
Like Old Dirty Bastard I’ma get a Grammy
If I gotta run up in the ceremony with a gat and a gun
Understand me, I make your balls split 
I make your dome shiver
Split your throat, with a sliver of my platinum plaque
I slither over tracks like snakes
Deliver raps with no mistakes
I’m a cobra spittin’ venom in your face

Chorus (.5x)

[Gumz]
Uh, yeah, yo, check it, uh, yo
I’m maniacal; when I flow I’m never fully liable
Anyone who listens will become a homicidal
Not a chance for a survival when I come for the title
Mothafuckas disappear upon my arrival
My brain cavity defies all gravity
Anytime I finish up a track it’s a tragedy
The beat begs me to come back on
The sound is incomplete without my voice on the song
Uh, I’ve waited too long to come back out
Debated many times of what my life is about
I hold a torch for this rap, I’m a natural
Born to scorch tracks and become geographical
Magical with the soul of a poet
Legendary status where I’m going and you know it
Doubts tracks with my ravenous traps
Listen very close and hear the game collapse
On wax yo I burn like candles
Dirty ass shit that I’ve learned from Vandals
Can I get a witness? Rip this, dish this
Lyrically gifted, shit I’m sick with it
You don’t want none of it, bitch I’m running it
Gunning down every last one for the fun of it
There’s no hook ‘cause I just can’t stop
Continuously flowing like a hippo of logs yo
Pine-box’s covered with toxics
Chemicals or general and I rock the spot
Uh, I feel the beat from my head to my feet
Take a seat and listen to the fucking style unique
Deep six, and I don’t even speak English
Weak shit where the peak doesn’t even exist
Don’t sleep for a second it’s a date for the reckoning
When I’m on the beat yo consider me a weapon
It’s a fire that can’t be put out
Spit from my lips it’ll burn down your house
Not a mouse but a man on a mission
When I’m on the mic I get a psychedelic vision
Infectious, bless this, flow like no other
Not to mention, Ghost you a bad mothafucka
Not Shaft, but the mastic craftsmen
I’ll take it so serious, so why you laughing?
Passion, sweat, tears and blood
The sum and result of what the years become
World is so fucked up from all this greed
All the CEOs is just master thieves
Fuck what I need I’ma take what I want
No matter who suffers and I put up a front
About time someone pays the prize
Or you end up like Ken Lay and pay with your life
Word up! - Uh, Ghost, yo, I’m out

Take all the love we have
Give all the loving back
Burn all the words we had
But don\xc2\x92t you dare, don’t you dare come crawling back
Take everything you need
Take all the blood I bleed
Burn all that\xc2\x92s left of me
But don\xc2\x92t you dare, don’t you dare come crawling back

Go if you have to leave
Go where you have to be
Don\xc2\x92t you feel bad for me
Just don\xc2\x92t you dare, don’t you dare come crawling back
Do what you have to do
Do what it\xc2\x92s best for you
Go if you think it\xc2\x92s cool
Just don\xc2\x92t you dare, don’t you dare come crawling back

Cause I still believe in love
You give it all back
So don\xc2\x92t you come crawling here
Don\xc2\x92t you dare come crawling back

Don\xc2\x92t you dare come crawling back

[Intro]
Yeh, you know it yeh
Detroit City
Guilty Simpson, clap it up y’all
Beats at will, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don’t really care what squad you wit
Cause a real nigga don’t need sponsorship
And a posse don’t make me hard
I’m a leader so I gotta play these cards and face these odds
Ain’t no time to chase these broads
Tryin to get paper to create these jobs
And it’s a fact when you’re black that you don’t know how to act
when your bellybutton’s touchin your back, yeah
That’s why a lot of us fuck with the crack
Cause it’s the easiest way to double your stacks
And all the hoes scream "Where the hustlers at?"
Usually the pretty chick with the bubble in back
Word to Dilla dawg I’ma get it all
Combination safe behind the picture on the wall
Even though moms raised me right
I swear to God rap shit saved my life

[Chorus]
Yeah, all the people in the back sippin ‘gnac
We representin for y’all niggaz, do it! ("clap your hands")
C’mon, it’s a party
("You and you and you to clap your hands") Everybody
All my people with the drinks in your cups
Turn the muh’fuckers up and go nuts

[Verse 2]
My mood swings like pendulums; I got two birds
One’s a middle finger and trust me that’s the friendly one
Because my Desert Eagle will kill all who envies him
We transport info quicker than Pentiums
I’m gutter, what I’m spittin is classic
So walk on eggshells or I bury you bastards
I rep the D, so when you speak about me
I’m the letter between C and E
In fact I’m the one between 3 and 3
With a smokin gun commitin B and E’s
And I don’t fake at all, all I can be is me
And if you don’t like it I dare you to get excited
Detroit nigga my area is the tightest
The raps come easy, live it see it and write it
Drug war shoutout mentally sick men
Naturally my breed’s equipped with thick skin

[Chorus]

* send corrections to the typist

[Chorus]
You done fell in love wit a thug

Yo, I was in the game
And when you dealing with all that death?
Sometimes spirits come back and haunt you

My life, sometimes, be haunted, by my memories
Visions in my head, show me diggin up, my enemies
I hate to go to sleep because of the dread that’s in my head
At times I find myself running from shadows of the dead
They try to pull me under, and bury me alive
I wake up, thinking it’s over, a good thing I survived
They pull me back to sleep, and seperate my soul
from my body, and put my blood and flesh in a hole
Ahh dig it’s worse, now the curse, caves my faith in
I rose from beneath the surface of the earth, as Satan
Inflicting people with war, drugs, diseases
Jumped up, go back to sleep, resurrected, ahh Jesus
Healing, the same motherfuckers I just inflicted
Spreading righteousness, the word of God, my mind is twisting
A holy war in the mental, I’m sort of brain dead
Spirits got me under pressure and they’re fucking up my head
Now I lay, me down, to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul, to keep
And if I should die, before, I awake
I pray the lord, my soul to take
A priest, performed an exorcist when I was conceived at birth
The casting of the demon off the earth
Devils, worship me like a thesis
Nurses, rolled me in a room full of priests
Where they attempted to cleanse my soul from evil
With crosses, bibles, holy words, and needles
Redrum, voices, evil dead, they told me
I snatched the cross, jigged the priest in the head and left him holey
(damn) My spiritual circle is evil, priests they attacked it
They jumped all over my flesh and put me in a straightjacket
Strapped me to the bed the priest screamed as he bled
They tackled me and shackled me from my feet up to my head
(dang) Now I lay to rest no longer stressing my escape
I fall deep into a dream, I see those spirits and I awake
(mmmm) Now I lay, me down, to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul, to keep
And if I should die, before I awake
I pray the lord, my soul to take
Another time my mind dwelled on a spell
I heard the cries from the dead souls burning in hell
Visions of their flesh, drowning in the flood
Well under hallucinations I seen heads soaked in blood
(damn) I snapped back to reality, and asked for my bible
Opened it up, in hurried confusion reachin for survival
(mmmm) When all of a sudden, I’m overpowered by that curse
(dang) The psalms that I’ve read, made my visions worse
(mmmm, dang) Seen a therapist, told him spirits tried to bury me
Spilled what was on my mind when I was done HE needed therapy
He recommended a baptism, a sacrifice
My soul rose to heaven but was cast back down by Christ
(damn) In forms of thunder, rain hail, heavy winds
Not even the blood of Christ, could cleanse my Concious of Sin

[Verse One]
I push black market rhymes in a white collar world
For the opportunity to make a mighty dollar bill
Gotta deal with the real
Reality is a snake that’ll strike if you let it sit and rattle in your face
And it’s poison
Wake up every night hearin’ noises
When the wind blows man I swear I hear voices
Choices, decisions, boys go to prison
Girls havin’ babies, people dyin’ and we miss ‘em
The system, a cycle
The rich get richer
On every corner there’s a spot for us to buy liquor
And every mornin’ we know we got to make a livin’
So every mornin’ we go to work to go get it
The stereotypes you put me in, I don’t fit it

[Verse Two]
You sure you wanna be the rap games greatest rapper?
They murder them
And then you never see the killer captured
My theory on that is, we’re too influential 
Politicians don’t reach ‘em like we do on instrumentals
Imagine if Pac could’ve endorsed Barrack
Then the lines at polls would have wrapped around the block
If Biggie would have went on tour for Al Gore
Then possibly, there wouldn’t be a second Gulf War
So logically
I speak what I feel in my heart
Cause there’s a lot of rap fans that are still in the dark
About the ways of the world, the games bein’ played
The money we’re throwin’ away, that ain’t bein’ saved
I can’t be afraid to touch on the hot topics
To win you gotta gamble like playin’ the stock market
So when you see me scramblin’ like there’s no tomorrow
I’m doin’ it for my family
Hustlin’ for my honor

[Verse Three]
This is problematic poetry
A symphony of struggle
A masterpiece of melancholy misery and trouble
So open your eyes because the enemies among us
Givin’ us record deals like the industry can run us
It’s funny
Real MC’s police themselves
The same way a street dude will release those shells
From the clip of his whip and if he’s threatin’ a corner
I apologize Morehouse I left without warning
The same way my mother left Morris
Which is further proof we live in the shadow of those before us
The burden of the past is enormous
Imagine my plight tryin’ to write with the legends in the chorus
It’s morbid
Watchin’ men throw they lives away
Chasin’ fortune and fame knowin’ their souls can’t afford it
Reward it
Not with the glamor and salt
But with relentless criticism till you’re just an afterthought
Dan Johns

[Chorus - sung]
The days, fly by fast
And your love, may not last
Your fame may have passed
but your, name it still remains
Lyrics will fade
And ex-ec-u-tives paid
will leave your shit played
but your, name it still remains

[Main Flow]
Hey yo I’d rather be rhymin than trapped in court
In fact, make this a Michael Rappaport
When I met you you didn’t seem like the testy type
Fuck around on the set kid, Wesley Snipes
We in the mountains where it’s brisk
You know you couldn’t - everything is Cuba Gooding
End ya man for the Benjamins
And stay out for the ginger lens
My vocals rock crews, plus I got locks too
Young chicks out Vivica Fox you
More than cream and organ beamin
I’m still out here, Morgan Freeman

[Chorus]

[Main Flow]
Black Timb’n, in fact stack women
Dis year y’all Jack Lemmon
Close steppin to me, toast preppin the key
I get live Mos Def-initely
It’s for your hidden hand you can’t get rid of my plan
You got to be Nicole Kid-man
The don wins, invest with Con-Airs
And write hot shit with Sean Penns
You pour germs, when you know that it’s your turn
Now watch how the backwoods George Burns
So face facts, still dealin with snakebacks
Replace tracks when niggaz act Sissy Spacek

[Chorus]

[Main Flow]
Seem louder, now that the cream’s milder
You think you wild best believe I’m Gene Wilder
Mack one, this ain’t a act hon
Step and get Samuel Jack-son
Felony news, snitches sellin me clues
Blow highs like Penelope Cruz
The type to bug this, stay on your bicycle thug list
When I’m out of weed, I’m Michael Douglas
The pen spiller, this is your end killer
Show me your girl and watch me Ben Stiller
And I’m talkin a, cuddly whore
Hit up the trick have her lookin for Dudley Moore

[Chorus] - 2X

Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost  (yeah, I said it)
X2

Fuck Catholicism, I’ll save you all from this prison
Christianity only exists within insanity
As I purch in a Saturday stance
Eliminating the Church of Latter Day Saints
Episcopalian, and I’m a distant alien
And listen as I whisk you away again
I’m determined to put an end to your sermon
Permanently burning all the vermin
These Institutes love to prostitute all of the destitutes
And that’s the truth
A wafer doesn’t make me feel safer
Jerry Falwell is a scary tall tale
Tell Reggie White I’m feeling edgy and uptight
Legendarily, sacrilegiously I’ll write
All bibles should be liable
And thus tie-able to the tribal
Reading psalms is not like feeding throngs
It’s like kneeding tongs over bleeding palms
I hope you don’t take this strong
I love you, but you’re wrong

Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost  (yeah, I said it)
X2

God, you know that I’m your passenger
Eliminate the masquerading messengers
All these apostles are not colossal
Lost and hostile Pentecostals
I’m not saying that your faith is an impostor
You’ve been bossed into the wrong roster
Matthew and Luke are just people’s names
Feeble veins versus old deep gains
There’s no way in the world that the bible is the manual for life
Annually handing humanity the knife
Watch’em be hung on the neck by a rope
They’re brainwashing the brand new pope

Organized religion is false
And anyone that follows it is lost (yeah, I said it)

Our slaughter who parts the heavens
Don’t follow the insane
Thy will get done by the Sungodsuns
Take your worth to the so-called heaven

God, I’m waiting... tampering with greatness
I am pampering your lateness
Camper me from the hateness
Completely damp and yet weightless
Add another watercolor to the watercooler
Add another mother daughter to the father sooner
Watch the faithful balance
A hundred different ways all at once in silence
As I time travel, my mind is a blind gavel
For your --?-- gravel
This is an excercize in sacrilegious babble
For your unconscious to unravel
Religion was born to be material
We have been torn from our imperial
Destiny, brought to you in stereo
Excommunication is a miracle

[Intro]
Who knows where the road may lead us
Who knows if we’ll meet along

[Sadistik]
I whispered in her ear just to glare inside the fences
Her ambrosia could paralyze the senses
A paradigm, to hear the acid rain
Of paradise she dreamt with the tears she can’t contain
And one by one, they poured in incrementally
She took my crown of thorns and she wore it as a wedding ring
Said "I do," reciprocated vows
And blew a thousand kisses to the dissipated clouds
I held her claws as we walked between the headstones
Of those who tried connecting all the dots between her freckles
Then she let go... and so did I
as I studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment
All her thoughts would compose a careful symphony
that summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity
They sang a hymn though that could cloak the air in mystery
to shatter all my shields, to expose a flair of misery
On a day like this, I’ma break my wrist
when I write a little bit about the strangest kiss
that would grace my lips, and the frozen tongue
that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss
I start to choke, break in half ‘cause I can hear the battle sounds
Of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now
You think I’m sentimental? I think you’re heavy mental
with some innocent intents too intense cause you said "be gentle"
And this is more or less a morbid test of sordid stress
A foreign sense of orchid scents before I lay my skull to rest
I sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised
You grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained
But at least you’re honest, speaking like you’re being modest
‘til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it
Your eyes resemble Mephistopheles, in fact
I’ve never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black
The Diva de los Muertos is just swallowing my skin
When she sneaks in with her scarecrows and it’s haunting me again
When she...

[Interlude]
I’m not gonna, tiptoe around your, marriage or
whatever it is you got going there
Do you wanna be with me? Be with me (okay)
Too many guys don’t get the concept, or
I complete them, or
I make them alive
I’m just a fucked up girl who’s looking for a decent mind
Don’t assign me yours

[Sadistik]
I always knew you were pretty with all those scratches on your face
Look...

And while I’m all apologetic you just conjure monsters headed
to my head, it’s probable, the claws are sharpened, sharp and ready
Steady when you’re treading, careful not to fall in love
Cause when I’m finally done you’ll know why it’s called a crush
All your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh
Still you cut your tongue out cause you don’t want to taste it yet
So save your breath, you kiss me like a guillotine
fuck just like a whore and smell like whiskey and some Listerine
Follow me again and sing and howl with the wind
And when I travel to the gallows you just scowl me again
And grin with foul teeth and skin, when you go to bury daisies
Haunted by carriages, +Rosemary’s Baby+
Listen gravedancer, with disarray pander
Your lips display cancer and kissed my face after
Come and go to summon hope with cryptic fake glamour
But under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter
And it’s hard to keep your sanity when spirits’ll consume you
and you’re consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo
Who knew, that you could smile when you take a life?
Surviving from the vitamins you’re finding when you take a bite
All my questions all are meshes, wallowed sections
Of my chest, the small intestines, large intestines
all a plexus, all digested
Not to mention, you’re just following a trend
When the Diva de los Muertos is just haunting me again
(Just is haunting me again...)

[Verse One]
As I rightly divide, between truth and lies
I can present with proof how He knew these guys
Were goin’ to cry on Him, spit on Him and gonna lie on Him
Third day from layin’ away was gonna rise on them
Took His righteousness purged my sin
Blood drippin’ from the cross as He urges men
Some servin’ Him, puttin’ position to come and bird with Him
I mean to fly, most definitely want to fly
If I draw nigh to Him He’ll draw nigh to me
I see God through Him that d-e-a-t-h settin’ me
Straight from all angles, givin’ charge to all angels the star spangled
Banner doesn’t have anything on Hosanna
Cause the manner, in which He does things for His offspring
As awesome as it seems, it’s right and good
Cause I’m flossin’ the King tonight in ‘hoods

[Chorus]
Brothers in the front we don’t stunt cause we livin’ righteous
Homies on my left ain’t no death cause we livin’ righteous
Shorties in the back we don’t slack cause we livin’ righteous
Righteous livin’ righteous livin’
Homies on my right we alright cause we livin’ righteous
Brothers in the front we don’t stunt cause we livin’ righteous
Shorties on my left ain’t no death cause we livin’ righteous
Righteous livin’ righteous livin’

[Verse Two]
First I was unclean, it was so dark I was unseen
Now my light beams, runnin’ to Christ or it might seem
That I might cling, to the righteousness of the King
Or I might fiend, for the dream of the bigger things
Cause the earth is His, castin’ in my cares cause my hurt is His
Writin’ my songs and my verse is His
The body of Christ or the church is His
I search the Scriptures of God to see what my purpose is
To give Him glory now I recognize, I testified
Then I blessed the God that rectified
My wickedness when I was petrified, edified
The body of Christ for them kingdom lies
Or kingdom livin’ all of us Christians are forgiven for that awful livin’
To the beginners don’t assemble yourself with the sinners
All of us and Jesus are winners, now I look right
Cause of the blood now I look white
I’m goin’ higher in Christ so now I book flight

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
All of a sudden His righteousness is like a lifestyle
Callin’ my brothers come outta strugglin’ to Christ now
All of you cluckers put down the drugs and throw the pipe down
Get rid of the sinful livin’ and come into life now
Take a look at the bigger picture and see mistakes made
Be a witness for Christians and see Christ has the way made
Way paved, the daybreak bru I stay saved
My wave praise, we set free from them slave days
Fightin’ with givin’, when you can be ignited and get righteous livin’
And right with God I take a look back into history
I’m seein’ the death no longer a mystery
Seein’ Him resurrect, my righteousness is that of a filthy rag
My righteousness is that of a filthy rag
My righteousness is that of a filthy rag
I confess I was guilty Dad
But then you cleansed me

Now if I died in a hail of bullets

Straight Kua-Kua-Killa
I keep thinkin’ and wonderin’ what the game got in store for me 
(the game got in store for me)

A motherfuckin’ G

[Spice 1]
Wake up in the mornin’ cleanin’ pistols
Put the brush in the barrel
I’m a killer to the bone
Murder laced in my metal
My eyes closed like Steve Foster
I got you in the square
Holla two slugs comin’ at ya from every-where
Got more guts than them Chinese 
on top of them liquor stores in the riots
Some niggaz out there wanna spray up and conspire to keep my quiet
Dumpin’ on site and leavin’ they chests smokin’ (chests smokin’)
If the shit lookin’ to syke big faulty, they die with eyes opened
How many niggaz can I kill on a track
Niggaz say that, catchin’ these slugs from the mack 
(slugs from the mack)
Niggaz die every day
In the street to the bay
Where intent to the homicide is as pure as the yay
If I die in a hail of bullets, would my niggaz go to war for me 
(what you think)
I only fuck with killaz
Real niggaz, fastest fingaz
With oozies up on the realest
Double em up in digits
Real live grave diggaz

Chorus

[Storm of The Outlawz]
Playin’ plot homicide
Somebody come tie the knot
Bulls Eye! Now we seein’ eye to eye
Yes I would ride if I had to die, die for mines
Outlaw, copy can’t fuckin’ stop me with that thuggin’ bloodline
Ain’t got no piece of mind
Nothin’ but finger we runs
Enemies, I’m a don, we lost memories, fuck em all in time
Up against the wall she blind, nigga how you gonna seek ya fine
Hit ya moms on the night ride for the next time with a timeline

Verse 3
[Napolean of The Outlawz]
Nigga I’m an Outlaw
To the day I’m ? and at the same time
And I’m side-smokin’
It’s my chokin’
This nigga died with his eyes opened
We made him do it, We thug influenced
Pre-occupied with rhymin’
Eternal livin’
Bring pain to prison
Hope they feel it when we all up in em’
Turn his inside to his outside
Switch em up like Gemini’s
Show em how the young ride
Introduce him to a homicide
Make his momma cry cause mom see
Tear up his shit when uncle ben’s up in court
Let him have intercourse

Chorus

[Spice 1]
I ain’t the motherfucka in jails, the next nigga’s destination
But niggaz was all so pullin’ it straight for different situations
If I was brought to this world to take this nigga out the game
Then so be it, ‘It’s murder!’ my oozies goin’ sang
Mother fucker, my swagger, known for having felonies
But wind up then we all dump a nigga
We bringin’ em hell on these streets
Drummery beats ya there
Niggaz be getting caught up in the same old shit
Gettin set up by that same old bitch
Turnin’ tricks with the ass and the perky lips
Ya know the hoe nipples was hua-hua-hollow tips
They wanted to kill me two times but the lord was with me
Since I can’t seem to kill death, hope he won’t let it get me
And if it do, and my enemies pull the trigga
I’m tellin my true partnaz right now, avenge me niggaz
Let them hoes have it, spread they ass with the fullies
Leave they ass on the street, mouth open and bloody

Chorus (2 times)

Big homie president, y’all can hang the rest up
Still on the block, cause artists we get the less cut
Bail money to the side, just incase I mess up
Y’all can either ride or roll over if ya left us
Catch up, never that, this team never slack
You rather that, ahead of that
Don’t know a homie better that can do it how we do it
It’s that Roc-A-Fella music, gotta move em

Look it time to set it off, the drama set it off
I see you when I see you, then I’m a let it off

[Chorus]

Ain’t worried bout you weirdos, your heroes, wannabe De Niro’s
Till that thing get sinked wit them air holes
We dumb nice, missed the price, hurry set it up
Got this thing on smash, be damned if we letting up
Keep on asking where we going, known to be smarter
Decision been made that we rolling wit Coach Carter
Beat start rocking and rock and keep rocking
If that semi jam up that glock’ll keep popping
It ain’t hard to find us, right down Wingohocking
You should ever have a problem, North is where you’ll find ‘em when it’s

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Pops]
Got me goin’ crazy
Hustlin’ for my baby
Times gettin’ shady
Hustlin’ for my baby

[Pops]
(Verse 1)
Am I doing it right? Sometimes, I don’t know
I’m tryin’ so hard, but will it ever show
Money can’t buy love, then money can’t pay the bills
And love can’t pay the doctor when my little girl’s ill
I’m strugglin’
Tryna make things right
With what little I have, money’s so damn tight
Got a dead-end job that pays half the minimum
Most my dollars, to the, bills, I’m givin’ ‘em
Tired of this
Being broke all the time
Got dreams of making it big, spittin’ these rhymes
And I’m tired of seeing my little baby girl cry
Cause her friends got what she don’t have, she wanna know why
What kind of daddy am I?
To give her life so rough
I keep tryin’, but it seems like it’s never enough
At the end of the day, when I’m tired and unhappy
My baby says "No matter what, I still love ya, daddy"

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse 2)
Livin’ life ghetto
Broke as fuck
Got a world full of drama, dealin’ with my baby’s mama
Tryin’ to be a man, the perfect dad for my baby
With a mama on my back, damn, it’s drivin’ me crazy
Sometimes, I feel I’m losin’ my mind
But I got a little girl, so I’m keepin’ in line
Tryin’ to maintain in a world so cold
Tryna keep a real job in a world where drugs are sold
Got a job, breakin’ my back, a one bedroom shack
And there’s always drivebys where my baby’s school is at
What kind of life is this
For my daughter to see
But this is all that I can afford, so this is where we gotta be
Fuck that I had it
Livin’ life scandalous
I gotta change somethin’ cause my mind just can’t handle this
Diggin’ to my pockets and see what I got
Make a move, now I’m the new dog spot on the block
Damn

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse 3)
I thought life would get better
By slangin’ some rocks
But it’s only getting worse cause it’s so damn hot
And then if I get caught, tell me how’s that gonna look
With me headin’ up state
And my baby gettin’ took
Away from my daddy
My life would end
Lord, tell me why they make good money, I must sin
It ain’t about me, so I ain’t being greedy
And if you got kids, then you know it ain’t easy
Workin’ 9 to 5 for your baby, doing it right
Barely making enough to pay the rent and the light
And so on and so on, it gets no better
But now I’m kickin’ rhymes, bout to make major cheddar
Tryna make it happen and I got a good shot
Doing it all for my daughter cause she’s all that I got
Tryna make my baby girl proud of her daddy
Someone that could floss her in a brand new Caddy

[Chorus] - 4X

[Verse 1]
Now, the industry has got me thinking twice
Thinking with the treble mix, gotta shake em like dice
Let the whole world know I can’t go for that
Girls know that I got gold and stacks
In every cul de sac from the streets to the clubs
I’m making hits and everybody’s showing love
Fact is I’m back and I’m rolling like jackson
Won’t stop until I’m back at multi platinum
So I start with some action, I’m the main attraction
Here to lie down to the west crackin
Stackin big chips, holmes, gotta get em
Hauling in lots of residuals, what you got
You can’t choose me
Bring it to you live for the year 2g

[Chorus]
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I’m going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - you never ever made me
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I’m going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - I’m all fucked up

[Verse 2]
Yo, ice it’s jim splice me in - no, stop
Begin, pause, cause I gotta call the next of kin
Tell em where you been, tell em that you’re ok
Doa, here say, no way, won’t say
Dead yes, dead all, not dead and gone
Like a multi-leader, a little bit withdrawn
Time and go like a vicious cycle
Then wham, make em think that you are coming out like george michael
On par to make people to turn in no sooner
Hook, line, and sinker; like charlie the tuna
Drop the hero and get with the zero
I’ll try to keep it clean like mr. belvedere
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck the single
Don’t want to take it in the can, you’re not pringles
But once you pop you can’t stop
So don’t interrupt - situation normal all fucked up

[Chorus 2x]

Round and round we go, where it stops nobody knows
Round and round we go, where it stops nobody knows

All I do is spit nothin but reality
Jay Tee got that Vallejo mentality

I’m from Vallejo where the players dwell
The game is cold but these streets is hell
Extra hot, so when I’m on the grind I’m sweatin
I can’t be lettin police stop this money I’m gettin
I’m watchin out for haters, too
Prayin for me to fail cause that’s what haters do
They hopin that I don’t last
That Playa Jay Tee is just a thing of the past
But playboy, I’m here to stay
I continue gettin money every day
My lifestyle is not pretend
That’s why I’m on it so tough, gettin it in
I’m knowin you don’t understand
God’s got my back, so I fears no man
But still I’ma keep me a cuete
It’s money on my mind twenty-four-siete

All I do is spit nothin but reality
Jay Tee got that Vallejo mentality

I’m out here in my Cadillac Brougham
My daughter keep textin, ask me when I be home
I wish that I was right there with her
But I’m tryina get money for some new shoes cause I always forget her
And that’s why it’s undisputed
I’m in possession with intent to distribute it
You never gon’ catch me without it
Since Delano junior high I’ve always been ‘bout it
I kept cash steadily flowin
Like a bitch on the corner that’s readily hoein
The streets is what painted my picture
I always kept it one hundred every time I fucked with ya
That fake shit, I just can’t be it
I keep a middle finger high to make sure all you squares can see it
I’m dealin with these cats that’ll kill ya
Riskin my life just to feed mi familia

All I do is spit nothin but reality
Jay Tee got that Vallejo mentality

Yeah
That Vallejo mentality, mayne
That’s all I know
See I was born and raised in the V-Town
707
I done spent my whole life runnin these streets
I know nothin else but this
Go ahead and ready my history
Check my history
Get to know about it
Understand me?

All I do is spit nothin but reality
Jay Tee got that Vallejo mentality

Wooooah oh oh
Staring over in a brand new way
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it’s a brand new day
And I’ll never ever ever be the same
No I’ll never ever ever be the same

Your sun light is on my face
Your life is all I chase
I Run right upon this race
Cause in you I’m gone put all my faith
Some nights I lose my way
Sometimes I walk and stray
But you come right inside my space
And each time you come you give me strength
This time I fix my gaze
This time it wont be the same
This time I wont be ashamed
So this time I can’t help but say that..

Your sunlight is on my face
I look back how far I came
I think about how much I’ve changed
It was hard at times but I’m not the same
You deserve all this praise
You deserve all the fame
You deserve all my ways
I point back to you each and all my days
I reach and grab all you’ve gave
I see your hands all you’ve made
I see your plan and all you’d save
That we can have life (got me singing\xc2\x85)

[Bridge]
I’m not where I want to be
But I’m not where I used to be
I’m not where I want to be
But I’m not where I used to be

[King Mez]
This how you end it
 
Uh, a young King, always I had known it
but didn’t know what to call it, maybe I telephone it
I just knew that I was different, wasn’t livin for moments
{?} Gotti’s tone, I ain’t, nobody’s clone
I mean, I want that throne, it ain’t gotta be the main one
Just as long as don’t nobody livin got the same one
So I keep utensils closed, my pen is my brain’s gun
Momma told me, "When you ‘bout yo’ business, boy you bring one"
So, this is the close as you get to seein me unprepared
Because I won’t be, so lyrically tryna fold me
My writtens is called a fractional, slippin is called subtraction
My mission is causin action, these country niggas is slackin
Yeah, do all that crackin when they was callin ‘em wack
And cheatin all of his raps and distraction writin in classes
Now you see how they actin, see and feel all that passion
All them cameras flashin, couldn’t even imagine how I feel
...Growing into my title
No way, from any rival, they auto think of survival
Because they know that I’m libel to hop up on tracks and embarrass ‘em
Faces be avacado, honestly homey I know
If you ain’t got no pain, you will not understand like I do
I won’t do this in vain, it ain’t no blood on me and my crew
I won’t be part of chains, I’m too intelligent to follow
I got heart, you niggas hollow! Just call me Rollow
 
[Phonte]
Yeah...it’s Phontigga
King Mez, waddup? Young Khrysis on the beat
And nigga, I cut yo’ shit in half ‘cause I ain’t feel like waitin
 
Uh, wack verses, I don’t own one
Bullshit is not in my possesion, and that’s without a question
Word to Kweli and Khrysis dawg, +I’m On One+
Sprint like a Kenyan, I’m in it for the long run
Ask me for your opinion, we all got a strong one
I’ve been livin with ‘em since I made song one
back in ‘99, but for praise I do not live
Spit it like Yoda, a FUCK I do not give
I’m on a high still, I’m overpowerin
Phontigga towerin, all over you niggas like the Eiff-el
I will kill this, still it’s rap niggas
claimin they sick with no symptoms of illness
You clear for work, hoe nigga, go and get a job
or hit the net and cry about it - fuck it, get a blog!
I be sangin but with rap, shit I’m still involved
Make ‘em say, "Chu’uch~! ?Mostenveur? Synagogue" 
This is what I’m in it for, I can taste the dreamers
I pace the ring, gettin ready for the title, wait-
I’m co-starring, sparrin with King Mez 
I show love to the young Gs’, they help me stay in fightin shape
North Carolina is back on the bih’ness
‘til all competition get back on the benches
Take off my Fedora, put back on the fitted
Like this y’all, this fall, I’m back on you niggas!
Eh-hahaha, yeah...

[Charli - Intro]
Yo, yo
Charli Baltimore
Suave House, what (pimp da one you love)
Yo, Untertainment yeah
From N.Y. to GA
Yeah yeah
This for all my ladies yo
All my ladies that are pimps
Right, cause we can be pimps ladies, we can be pimps
Yo

[Charli]
From the intro, nigga had me hooked like indoe
Shoulda kept my shit tight like homes with no windows
But women knows
Ballers, be sayin’ that right shit
On some layin’ that pipe-shit
But me, got right quick
Open, still kept my feelings tight-lipped
Trippin’, all game was slippin’
Off the hyped bit, always been the tight bitch
Keep these cats in line, pay that rent on time
And we’ll talk about extra keys to my spot
When it’s extra V’s in my lot, extra G’s in my knots
So how I managed to get damaged on ‘chill with one nigga’ shit
I was to break me off with some more figures bitch
I don’t know, just caught me at the right moment
Vulnerable, nigga jumped up on it
With mind games, took me out of my frame
I ain’t even want his payback, my homey Tony Drapper
He pimped for the guts and I was givin’ ‘em up
Can’t tell me I can’t have any player I want
And I burnt myself out tryin’ to turn his ass out
All he wanted was a fling and no strings
Slayin’ me, on some less weighin’ fee
One-half of his shit
But when it blew up, I said fuck this rappin’ shit
Been sheisty all my life, and it came back
It happens when your minds attached to your perfect match

[Eightball] (Rodney)
Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin’ ain’t easy)
Let ‘em know that pimpin’ ain’t easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin’ ain’t easy)
Gotta get the dough, no time for the jealous

Charli Baltimore put it in they face (pimpin’ ain’t easy)
Let ‘em know baby, pimpin’ ain’t easy
Pimp ladies and pimp fellas (pimpin’ ain’t easy)
Gotta get the dough, yeah
Pimp da one you love

[Charli]
Yo, so what now?, after all this time has past
Just to find out, all along, it was just a gas
I asked my best friend, my dog for advice that got me
And I was twisted, haters got me
Yeah, no doubt, it’s a nigga and shit
He was trippin’ off the way I was OP off the trick
He said, "Yo, you can scoop any nigga you wish"
Just seperate the dick from your mind and shit
Make that punk recognize how your time was spent
How your time was lent, not how your mind was bent
Get yourself back from that cat
And rise above, only way to pimp
Is to pimp the one you love
Wise words, my dog got me trained right
Game tight, had to stay strong and to stay tight
Stay nights, with my doggie
Knew he had my back till the day I made eye contact
With my old boo, best friends, remember what I told you
Pimpin’ ain’t easy, gotta play sleazy
Went to his house, put it on him and bounced
Fucked him with my eyes open, got him groppin’
Tables turned, nigga stressed, nigga guessed
He could play a player
But I got schooled and fooled him
Ladies let me tell you how you get it and win
First shit on him and then say forget it on him, yeah

[Charli - Outro]
You know what I’m sayin’?
All these niggas go around talkin’ bout they pimps
Ladies’ is pimps, knwhatImsayin’’?
We know how to get to niggas minds
With the pussy and then get they minds yo
It’s a mind thing, you know what I mean?
Niggas runnin’ around on some bullshit
Ladies is takin’ over
Gettin’ these niggas fucked up, yo
I’m tellin’ you
The only way a lady can become a pimp
Is to start with that nigga that is always under you, yo
Pimp dat nigga
Make that nigga work for your ass
Yeah, yeah
This is the words of Charli Baltimore, 98 shit
You know what I’m sayin’?
Untertainment, Suave Hourse
Tony Draper, T-Mix
Big Dru, and I’m out

Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine

I wanna be the best
I wanna wake up feeling like I fucking slept
I wanna prove you wrong, that my story isn’t written
I wanna be something gold, I wanna be someone different
Wanna turn back the clock, tell my father to be stronger
Cause he missed me growing up
And I want to tell the little girl in the corner of that room
Don’t lose hope, just be brave, things get better soon
I wanna fall in love
I wanna crash and burn but learn to rise above
And I don’t care about success, I just wanna make you proud
I wanna be the kind of person who shows up and sticks around
I wanna stay sincere, but that kind of thing is tricky
When you give up all yourself and still the end result is iffy
Like nothing I’ve created even matters
So now I wanna do stupid shit, I wanna get fucking plastered
Want to get out my brain, want to shed my skin
I need to find someone to tuck me in
Want you to know that I wanna be better
But it feels like it’s gonna take forever

Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine

I wanna do it all
I wanna stand up straight but have the strength to fall
I wanna tell my cousin to stop treating people bad
I know you think that no one sees, but I’ve been keeping tabs
I wanna be consoled
I want the world to change, I wanna die when I’m old
And I don’t wanna make mistakes that I’ve been watching all my life
It’s easy to do because, I want to be good despite
I wanna go somewhere else, I wanna get super high
Tell you to go fuck yourself, cause shit I’m doing fine
I wanna go break the chain of what I’m supposed to be
I wanna locate my faith, drop down on both my knees
And honestly, I wanna ask if you’d stay
For a night, for a week, or just a day
Always moving too late, shit I’ve been regretting
I wanna throw my phone, I wanna quit confessing
I wanna cast the blame, but nobody’s at fault
Confusion got me building these walls
Want you to know that I wanna be better
But it feels like it’s going to take forever

Gotta get it right, gotta get it right
To make today mine

[Intro]
{*barking*} Awww yes
Who the fuck are you?

[Verse One]
Erotic features
Girl without the vibe it’s like The Mack
The top of the bleachers, #85 the quarterback
I’m waitin to meet ya, pull me out the class
DJ this detention will reach ya with ponytails
Put coolie in the back, I need to tell ya somethin
Right now girl I’m as nervous as Peyton Manning
with the whole world waitin to tell me can’t win the big one
Institute your glamour and show me that I’m the one
for your daughter and son to give it to
And provided the brew with the only I can ignore ya
He’s sinister, when it comes to the furniture, he’s a damager
Sex on every bannister - why? Cause she concludes
that I’m the ultimate dude, last night ruled

[Chorus]
Remembering, these things, I know (last night ruled)
The best of times, we had, fo’ sho’ (last night ruled)

[Verse Two]
Not perfect planning, spontaneous, my shit do it phenomenal
Even that we must chronicle, no video just memory
Leaving nothing admissable, Vegas trip never happened
Ain’t gon’ matter what’s on your physical, find that, find the head
With spiritual preperation as holy as we can get
(Don’t matter with that) you can see the early intervention
of parasol and backpack, spinning stunning stunting
We’ll keep on waiting as long as tragedies are permitting
Remember beginning, never recognizing that their ending
I’m having a blast (so bang and so cool on yo’ ass)
(Last night ruled)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
The evenings they flow like moving never Spongebob’s pet
Gary to go, and acclimation confirmation they remember the show
We all enjoyed exuberation
Where women involved, no histrionic masturbation
Fight Club abrasions like you stayed alive was real amazing
Euthanasia, brain cells in order agin
Complex equations, sober felt it John Blazin
Situation creating, last night ruled
(Common effect, everybody see it on my face)
(Looking around) last night ruled
(Everybody see it on my face looking around)
Last night ruled

[Chorus]

[Outro]
These things I know
We had fo’ show
Motion, you are not the father!
{*barking*}
Everybody see it on my face looking around {*2X*}
Common effect, everybody see it on my face looking around
Everybody know I smoke weed just to get high

Tough Men may get weary
Tough Men may get weak
The lions may get hungry
And the eagles may not fly
The mountains may lose majesty
And the hills may turn to plains
A mother may leave her baby
But my love for you remains
 
Chorus
I will never leave you nor forsake you
Forever you are mine
Wherever you go, you’ll always find me
Even darkness can’t hide me
 
The earth may even pass away
But my promise will remain
You can ask the angels ‘bout me
And they all will say yes
Say yes! X4
 
Take My Beauty for your ashes
My Gladness for your grief
You shall be called oaks of righteousness
The planting of The Lord
 
The earth may even pass away
But my promise will remain
You can ask the angels ‘bout me
And they all will say yes
 
Chorus
So I will never leave you nor forsake you
Forever you are mine
Wherever you go, you’ll always find me
Even darkness can’t hide me
 
Say Yes!

Another day on the Westside, everything’s fine
Youngster coming up trying to sell me an alpine
Damn, that’s the fifth one this month
Gave him fifty bucks and threw it in my trunk
Rolled out, there was some things I had to do
Homies on the Westside were throwing a barbeque
Yeah, Chicanos got a peace treaty
But you won’t see homeboys on tv
The media will shed no light, but that’s alright
Chicanos were killing each other every single night
Eses dropping left and right
Till the vatos from the pen stepped in
I guess it was a test to see who had guts
I guess it was a test to see who really had nuts
I’m sitting here rolling in my ride
Oh what the hell, just another tale from the Westside

Westside, that’s the spot
Westside, don’t get caught
Westside, after the dark
Westside, you gotta have heart

*scratches*
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide
..Westside Westside..
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide fool

Another day, another ducket
I’m sitting here rolling in my bucket
Thinking of a way to make some quick primero
Without busting out with my double-barrel
Cuz there’s some youngsters who look up to me
And kicking it in the county ain’t my cup of tea
So I start to wet my whistle
Now I’m looking down the barrel of a pistol
They were four deep then four more creeped
Pulling over my ride, damn back away side
A jail cell is something I hate
I’m the creeper so I put my beeper on vibrate
They run my plates, cuff me up, and tow my ride
Oh what the hell, another tale from the Westside

Westside, that’s the spot
Westside, don’t get caught
Westside, after the dark
Westside, you gotta have heart

*scratches*
..Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide
..Westside..
..Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide fool
..Westside..
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide
..Westside Westside..
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide fool
..Westside Westside..

Living on the Westside ain’t an easy task
If you don’t know homeboy you better ask
Cuz what you don’t know fool, just might hurt
Even homegirls are putting fools in the dirt
Levas like that deserve to get stuck
Like that fool that tried to jack by brother for his drop truck
I can’t let it slide
Called up the homeboys, jumped in the G-ride
Rolled to the spot where he hangs
Kicked down the door, click click, bang bang
It’s a shame that the vato died
But maybe I’m insane or I got too much pride
Westside, that’s the spot
Westside, don’t get caught
Slipping in the park after dark talking noise
First to get your ass stomped on by the homeboys
Yeah, you can run but you can’t hide fool
Tales from the Westside

Westside, that’s the spot
Westside, don’t get caught
Westside, after the dark
Westside, you gotta have heart

*scratches*
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide
..Westside Westside..
..Westside Westside..
You can run but you can’t hide fool

You can run but you can’t hide

Shit, 
Shane Capone... the idiotic Bizarre
Spit in your face

[Bizarre]
Shut the fuck up, before your ass get knocked
It’s hard to talk, with a gun in your mouth
Dirty Dozen, nuthin but bad news
Fuck a bitch in the ass with a rubber Hush just used
Fuck the pain, I don’t give a shit
Tie me up and beat my ass cheek with hockey sticks
(uh!  "you’re sick") I don’t give a damn
Smokin crack with Michael Jackson in the ???? ??? program
Blaow, blaow!  You hear this loud sound
Fuckin the engineer’s wife while he’s mixin my songs down
Walkin up in the elementary, lookin like a bum
Watch some kid yell "He’s got a gun!!!"
I’m the shadiest nigga here to come out the Dirty Doz
Do a song with you and tell people how wack your verse was
("Shit’s wack!") I’m laid back like John Forte’
Who got a screw driver so me and my girl can have foreplay?  

[Hook]
We some Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels
Dirty, Filthy, Rotten Scoundrels

Dirtyyyyyy, Filthyyyyyy, Rottennnn, Soundrels
Dirtyyyyyy, Filthyyyyyy, Rottennnn, Soundrels

[Swift]
We walk around this bitch triflin’
Quick to sock a nigga while we cypherin’
Rubber gloves, Black man rifled in my right hands
Watchin rappers dash like hyphens
Burnin y’all without the Tetracycline
I’ma let your set know, I can get drunker than Jethro
Just to run up on you, and crack you with this ????
Smash your vehicle, snatch your key and go
You niggaz think you got somethin to say, let me know
Don’t bite your tongue, fuck it
Rappers switch subjects 
When I’m steppin in they company, them hoes don’t get budgets
Snatchin briefcases with your hundreds
Packin heat just in case you want it (nope)
Bodies in abundance
I have no feelings, tell you the truth - I’m known, bitch
I’m lettin loose any affiliate you run with
So pack your gun quick (nigga), cuz I’ma let you know
You ain’t got a bone to pick with me, bitch I fuck so

[Hush]
Ay yo I’m iller than a white rapper usin the word nigga (WHAT!?)
Got a conflict with my dick like Dirk Diggler
Became sick in the brain since Bugz’s death
Whoever did it, I’m a bust a nose, slugs is left
I’m harder than my dick when I’m watchin my first porn
Ill enough to kill your wife while she’s havin her first born
Leavin the hospital, in a voice just like Beavis
Screamin "I need some!" while I’m holding up a fetus
Spittin the hot shit, nick name is godzilla (ugggh!)
Natural born, undercover cop killa
On the reala, yo, you’re just an enemy
Bout to come up missing like a second John Kennedy
Try to gamble with Swift, muthafucka the bet’s on
Let Shane fuck your bitch while Bizarre jacks off
Hush, I’m crushing rappers while I’m somersaulting backwards
Bustin nuts up in your mattresses, says nobody a better rapper 

[HOOK]

[Shane Capone]
What you motherfuckaz want, red dots when I pull it
Unless your name’s Pac, you ain’t shakin 5 bullets
Anymore, we hustle for cheddar, cheese, and mayo
Quick to hit your city up with more felonies than Jayo
We got murder for hire, all it takes is a call
We leave you slumped over in the suburbs like Biggie Smalls
Venomous lyrics, spittin shit like pipe bombs
Leave your maggot brain, hangin out the frame like Esham
We some Dirty, Filthy
But y’all ain’t feelin this shit
We comin’/cummin’ sicker than a syphilis dick
When we spit, somebody find Puff
Go tell him we got Jennifer hostage
We gon’ rape this little bitch, ain’t none of y’all stoppin
Cuz we raw doggin these bitches and they asshole with age
Hell naw, this ain’t range, but I got pistols on beret
Big Capone up in this bitch like the return of the living dead
And have your white born bloody sheets and a horse up in your bed 
Ain’t no freestyle rapper, but I play for Bugz without no problem
Have you stand around, look and dance, fucked like Dennis Rodman
If you didn’t want this muthafuckin rap game twisted
You should have never let Detroit listed (muthafucka)

[HOOK]

Yo
Give me a second, I’ll write about my pain for pages
I got a head full of frustrated phrases
So just bear with me as I get this out
You know the type of person that I’m talking about
These people who want to act like they’ve got your back
They never had your back, they just stab you in it
I never pretended I had it all together inside
I got insecurities and things I’m trying to hide
And I could never seem to get anything right
And I could never seem to stop busting my fight
And I could never seem to get it right with you
And I could never redeem myself when I’m through
But sometimes, you know what, I just don’t care
I’m gonna speak my mind and let everybody stare
This is the last time, I’m telling you real loud
If you want to tell me I’m wrong, let’s do it right now

[Chorus]
Start it all up, I’m ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, cause all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
Start it all up, I’m ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, cause all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got

Give me a minute, I’ll fill a newspaper with columns
Cause people saying that I got an attitude problem
That I’m negative when I rhyme, I complain
Pessimistic all the time, in these lines
All the same, I just talk like this on a record and let it out
I just cock back and let it all come flooding out
I just say the things that I know I feel are real
I peel back the skin ‘till the nerves reveal
You want to come with me, come closer to the speaker
You want to run with me, you’re gonna have to dig deeper
You want to let it all out, I’ll show you how
You want to tell me I’m wrong, we can do it right now

[Chorus]

Mike Shinoda
The most ferocious
Mike Shinoda
With or without an accomplice [x2]

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
You know, it doesn’t matter what city or state you from
You feel me Wood (yeah yeah), you always got them type of cats
That’s worried about how the next man, making his money mayn
(that’s why they still walking baby), you know
So what we about to do, for you ladies and gentlemen
Me and my big bro, fin to explain how we feel about
Them type of faggots, (finna get it on baby)

[Hook]
Everybody wanna know, how I’m gon stack my do’
Rule one I keep my focus, never trust these trifling hoes
For niggaz that be hating on me, I’m here to let y’all know
I never leave my crib, without packing my glock 4-0

[Lil’ Head]
Ok I never leave my crib, without packing
Cause niggaz get around these hoes, and start acting
Capping, like they living it up
But when you run up on a nigga, he’ll be giving it up
See I’m a grown man, and for a while been on my own man
And all I know is the streets, cause this my home man
I’m from the hood, of the go-getters
Where I was taught to stick and move, back down from no nigga
I suppose niggaz, wanna know my masterplan
Face the fact I stay hustling, that’s your fucking answer man
All my life, I seen a bunch of thangs
Hung around O.G.’s, and count a bunch of change
Paid attention to my dogs, now I got the game
21 years later, now I got the fame let me explain
All the hustling that I did, it finally paid off
Motherfuck a time card, and being laid off come on

[Hook]

[Mack Biggers]
With no love for a bitch, I hit the field and pitch
A quarter brick, whipping it to 36
A fa sho thang, is a slow swang
You can catch me in the gutter, putting the fork to some cocaine
With them grimey niggaz, packing fo’s mayn
Face it you niggaz basic, to getting do’ mayn
You lames is square as a pool table, and twice as green
In the field I’m a pit, that’s twice as mean
My SK, don’t play with the sniper’s beam
Nigga I smother a punk, I’m a righteous king
Count my dollars, stay low to the ground
And pop my collar, catch a nigga in my bidness
And shots’ll holla, this blood on mine
Plus my block is hotter, boys playing games
Trying to stop this rider, before you get it twisted
Picture me in the kitchen, steady whipping and mixing

[Hook]

[Lil’ Head]
They wanna know do I got cash, do I have a lot of hoes
Is it that bad, that y’all really have to know
Well here’s your answer, you niggaz make me sick
I think need my lanter, please pass me them pampers
Cause these niggaz, acting baby-fied
Steady whining and crying, because I’m nationwide
There go your pride and congratulate me, I know you punks glad to hate me
Cause I got do’ got hoes, plus I smashed your lady
C pass the gravy, for the wonderful dish
Press the button on the Boulo, bout to fumble the kit
Surran-wrapped em, then bundled the bricks
Send em overseas, with a ease and told em go on fumble with this
And these hoes, don’t make it no better
Steady roaching off the next man, instead of trying to make em some cheddar
So that’s why, a nigga play the role of being broke
But if my real niggaz need, I take care of my folks no problem

[Hook]

Voice: You know there comes a period in every womans life when
 she gets frustrated or fed up with her man and all his silly hangups
 You know a woman wants a man where she dont have to have no drama
 behind it You know jus somebody like to love her down with
 no strings attached and his name is "Splackavellie"

 Tell me what kind of superman

 and hit u with some front back and side to side
 Like hydrolics on a stormy night
 And break u off sumthin proper like

I need money (money), mo money. 
Mo money, (ching ching), money, nuthing move but the money. 
Money, money, look nothing move but the money. 
Money, money, that’s all I want, that’s all I want. 
I want it look.

You found me where the papers at, where the capers at
I don’t ask for a motherfucking thing, I take the scratch
Look I, franchise wearing, a franchise wrist
I’m franchise look, I need a franchise chick
She ain’t gotta be tight, she ain’t gotta be that rich
She just like I tell the other bitches that my nigga’s the shit
Black on black, step out the house 
with a suit and a tie soon to die, black on black 
Scratch a mack, scratch a jack, matter fact nigga I always stay strapped
It’s the game plan, I gotta win, I can’t afford to lose
I can’t be dressin in them kinda blues can’t afford to wear tight shoes
You know me, the nigga with the six four frame
With a six four cock back and hit your brain
You know the CEO nigga, ya’ll done seen before nigga
See me get dope and don’t tell a popo nigga
I don’t give a fuck, I hate ya’ll type
Yeah I might know ya but we ain’t nothing alike

(Chorus)
Now nothing move but the money, that’s all I want
Nothing move but the money nigga, that’s all I want
Nothing move but the money, that’s all I want
I’m on top cause I do what ya’ll niggas don’t, look

Catch me playing ball with Shaq, and points from real how to act
I did a shootin’ range, shoot the mack, when I bust for me to shoot back
See I’m nigga put the game that’s why I’m on top
I can sit eight seasons cold even when it’s hot
Come on drop the top for my Impala and shit
Nigga I’m out to get paper spit some dollars and shit
See how many ya’ll niggas could follow this shit
I got an attitude fuck the whole world, I gotta get rich
Ahh, and cap niggas screaming shit, niggas gleaming the wrist
You seen the six, seen his wrist, nigga you seen his chick
This shit that ya’ll spittin’, it’s meaningless
Everything ya’ll claim you did, I done it
And if I got, man fuck ya’ll nigga, I’m a flaunt it
And if I don’t got it I motherfucking want it
Bitch I sold keys, I smoke weed at PE I got blunted
Fuck the hatin’, I pull off that paper shit
Gotta love me or either motherfucking hate me bitch
Gotta hate my flow, nigga hate that I got dough 
And if I spend it all bitch I can make some more

(Chorus)

Keep it hot, I keep it locked, guns I keep it cocked
Runnin’ on the shop like I runnin’ on the block
Keep one up in the top, like one up in the drop
Spit till I spit, can’t spit no more it don’t stop
Like I live fast, I’m addicted to cash
Ain’t a thief  but sometimes I just forget to ask
I like say what the fuck I feel, nigga do what I want
If you don’t like it, fuck, fine, nigga we can take it to the trunk
And I get the spittin’ in your brand new six
Spittin’ if you even with your motherfucking chick
Spittin’ if you with you motherfucking click
But fuck it I’m just spittin, I’m just spittin the spit
Fuck it thick, yeah nigga what
Fuck that, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, I told yall
I don’t like to windows shop to see how high it is
Walk by and see how fly it is
I’m a ghetto superstar like Pras and shit
I got my idles so fuck it, I buy that shit
You only live once so like I floss my shit
Give to the poor, a nigga like floss on a wrist
Yeah I got a few dollars but I don’t even spend it no more
I’m trying to save up, for what, so I can buy the ghetto
I’m out to get money nigga
Mo money, money, mo money, nothing move but the motherfucking money 

(Chorus)

Gotta get yall money nigga.
Nothin move but the money.
Everything else is irrelivant.
Nigga yall gotta be willing to get what yall want nigga.
By any means.
No Limit nigga.
9-8, 9-9, 2 G nigga, whatever.
I’m out to get mine.
Oughta get yours.
Silkk The Shocker live in this motherfucker.
I’m out.

I loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
Tardy afternoons in utopia
Kiss an ugly turtle and make it cry

Sever the head of cornucopia
We rape the Earth and don’t know why it strikes

Do you believe in stormy weather, stormy weather
Hurricanes play musical chairs with homes and chattel
The whirling dervish tornados reek all disaster
See-saw tsunamis, give and take, what’s the matter?

I loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear

Sever the head of cornucopia
We fuck the Earth and don’t know why it cries

Do you believe in stormy weather, stormy weather
Hurricanes play musical chairs with homes and chattel
The whirling dervish tornados reek all disaster
See-saw tsunamis, give and take, what’s the matter?

I loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear

We broke our pact
And away we go
To another place
Home
Where we call home

Why do we disfigure all the things that are so beautiful inside
Where we compose the calamities for all to abide
Microcosm, macrocosm are the same
What a lame game

Don’t you think we’re extraordinary?
Believing and seeing
Realizing the imaginary
Don’t you, don’t you?
Yes, I think we’re extraordinary
Being and living
Yes, I think we ought to marry

We broke our pact
And away we go
To another place

I loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear

So much weight on my chest
I feel so alone
don’t know how to express
the stress in my heart
the wounds in my soul
The past is the past
but I can’t let it go
and it breaks me
I swear this shit fucking breaks me
I’m desperate
can somebody come and save me?
Cause lately I’ve been close to the fuckin’ edge
so many suicidal thoughts in my fucking head
I’m so depressed and I feel ashamed
popping pills everyday so I don’t feel the pain
but I don’t say shit
I don’t ever say shit
cause every time I try it’s like I hear the same shit
"Jay
you gon’ be just fine
you just gotta give it time
find your peace of mind."
But you don’t understand the tears that I shed
sometimes I just cry only wishing I was dead
And I’m sorry
I’m truly sorry for the way I feel
I’m so lost in my dreams don’t know what is real
This poetry is all I have when I feel deprived
I grab my pad and my pen
and I feel revived
I can’t decide what the fuck am I here for
I’m doing what I love but my heart’s still sore
I still battle with depression on a daily
I see my own reflection
and I swear I fuckin’ hate me
I said I swear I fuckin’ hate me
Got a big heart
but my heart’s slowly breaking
Chasing all my dreams
but I don’t know where it’s gon’ take me
Tired of being broke
gotta start acting shady
Making dirty money
yo
this shit is so degrading
Mamma
know I’m sorry for this route in which I’m taking
I ain’t fuckin’ proud of these decisions that I’m making
but I’m desperate for some answers
why my heart is always aching
If you hear me Lord
talk to me
all the sins from my past have been haunting me
I’m so scared of the future so I stay stuck broken into pieces
yo
my spirits all taped up
I came up
but it feels like I’m coming down
Pool full of liquor
swim ‘til I fuckin’ drown
That’s the only way I know how to crack a smile
taking shots ‘til I vomit and I’m passing out..
When I’m sober
I just feel afraid
I don’t know if I’ma live to see another day
I’m tryin’ to stand but I feel like I’m about to cave
I’m so trapped in my mind like a fuckin’ slave
So much weight on my chest
got me feeling tired
Plague in my soul
swear it’s like a wildfire
like a wildfire spreading everywhere
Take a look into my eyes
see the pain
oh
there’s plenty there
See the pain
yo
there’s plenty there
I don’t know if they really care
Where is love is it anywhere? And if it is
yo
it’s really rare
Can a broken heart be repaired?
Can a broken heart be repaired?
Can you tell me all I need to know
Or is it lost in our own despair?
Can you tell me all I need to know
Can you tell me all I need to know
or is it lost in our own despair?

Zhigge, you just completed a slamming album
Now what are you gonna do?

        We goin to Disneyworld!
*girls* We goin too!
        No you’re not!  Hahaha, get outta here, hahaha
*girls* Y’all ain’t right!
        Yes!!

All day, all day, ery day, always
I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 2X)

Out the side of the beat I slides out the gate like Snake Pliskin
with, heat fuming got more sauce than, Paul Newman
I’m the shit I’ll make you bowel, movement
Runnin through em without the celery
Never embraced when thinkin cleverly is a felony
Hey hey, hey-hey hey, I got an A A-A in mixing elixirs
Remedies putting you under the laughing gas, like a dentist
If you seek I got prescriptions that work in three minutes
and some change, here’s your receipt, here’s your re-ce-ee-hee-pt
I keep saying that al-lee-hee, couldn’t help me from these
em-cee-ee-hees, that keep saying wack rhizymes to enzymes
I regurgitate and reverse your fallopian tube growth, rate
You so fake you belong with a strong ass-whooping
I got your ass cooking, ho ho ho like turkey beefy bacon
is what you’re feelin, just a professional opinion from the doc-torrr
You don’t believe me then, let’s take tests test me
Please do so so I can have ya, full Stranded at Sea like Caruso
Have you lookin over The Aftermath like Dr. Dre
Me make a mill-ion, lambingas they say

I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)
Ery day, all day, all day, always
I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)

I’m the type of ninja that’ll laugh, then blast your ass
then pass the bomb that’ll fuck with my concious a little but I’ll stay calm
in it, armed, I’m all about self-preservation in a fighting stance
Always ready to get down then run up in your ass like ants
But I’d rather pull plants by the root and get, smoked
with my crew makin greenery, and scenery the vision of a landscape is
with a handful of papers, get the papers
with the President faces on the front, with the eagle grabbin arrows
and the pyramid, and the owl that shrunk, huh dollar bill y’all
It’s amazing how you keep paper grazing my palms and I make it stick
like a magnet like a magnum never stagnant when I’m stickin it
Movin keep my motion, all blurred most likely, a visuallusion
I have you on the search for attachment, but not to focus
Have you won a contest as a finalist, on whose the brokest?
Flows stay saturated and drenched, I’ve never had to soak it
I’m the wrong breed to fuck with, I’m mixed with Grinch and locust
hocus motherfuckin pocus, say what?

I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)
I’m Saafir everyday all day always

Psssssh, nigga please while you countin sheep it’s Z’s
I be countin cheese curin that, wack rap disease
Me and Doctor Dot Blocker on the off switch leavin
your highbeams frost-bit, with overdose
Homo songs don’t swing on the long, microphones
and if you’re rich I’ll send that doc-torrr to your mansion
while I’m, rock shit like avalanches
Makin your broad do dirty dances
You takin chances with them sleepin pills
Cause that’s what got your conciousness
That’s why I’m droppin this, don’t sleep...

I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 5X)
I’m Saafir, all day ery day, always
I’m Saafir, the Saucee Nomad

In here... (I’m Saafir) ...with the Porch Monkeys
(I’m Saafir) Bananas, Knuckles (I’m Saafir)
Bringin it to you (I’m Saafir)
One love to Mr. No No, for lettin me come on this track
and rip it for my poleops, that’s it, hip-hop junkies and Porch Monkeys
