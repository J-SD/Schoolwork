Have her climbin’ up the walls, stoppin’ traffic in the malls
My bad girl (Bad girl)
She love me, so I love her back
Shotgun in a Cadillac
Tokin’ on a candy sack

A.K.A. Miss Universe
Hundred grand large
Stuffed in her Louie purse

Hit the floor

Pop that ass, like it’s the bomb
Freaky thangs

That spark whip
That dark tint
Pink champagne, that’s player pimp
Montage black, (???)
I love the way, this bad girl tip
This poppin’, doll, we stompin’ on
Dame piece breezed, I’m real benign

[Irfane Khan-Acito]
Now that I’m, on the road again
Got time to think about where I’m going
I couldn’t think at all, now that I’m
Off and doing, faught for everything I knew and
I know, I know, you going to want, more and more and more
Now that I’m, on the road again
Got chips enough to see those cars you holding
Kid, that had the flow before
Now that I’m, free from you and
Free, from everything I’ve been through
I know we gonna make it
I’ve never been so sure

[Chorus: Irfane Khan-Acito]
Now that I’m free, you’re going to hear alot from free
Now that I’m free, I’m going to ask this world for more
Now that I’m free, I’m going to make it, yes I’m sure
Now that I’m free, open your eyes so you can see
Now that I’m free, you’re going to hear them things I say
Now that I’m free, I’m going to ask this world for more
Now that I’m free, I’m going to make it, yes I’m sure
Now that I’m free, watch me, watch me, fly away

[RZA]
Aiyo, I’ve been trapped in a bottle for years, like an ancient genie
Now I’m invading your country, like I’m Mussolini
The global furer, black gene, knowledge purer
Found the cure life in the holy Koran, first surrah
Now I’m free like the honey bee, spreading pollen
Flower the earth, with the words, that be true and solid
Find you fake funny foolish fiesty fickle faus
Sell your soul for a diamond crystal whipping house
I’m not for sale, so the devil, you can’t buy me out
Protect the seeds, protect that cheese, like I’m Mighty Mouse
Here I come to save the day
Now that I’m free, I could pave the way
Out like Mandela, cut a hole from the twenty five
You in the dark, you need to step to the sunny side
It’s about time you caught a sketch of my Outlines
You should worry about yours, I worry about mine

[Chorus]

Verse 1:
We rollin’ five cars deep, all logo thangs:
A Cutty, a Caddy, two OJ’s and a drop Mustang.
My nigga’s fucked in the Cutty gettin’ donuts, fishtail
And smokin’ up the block and "Two hun’ed block" is what he yellin’.
Hyped as fuck, gone of the Hen and dank,
Bitches all over the place, jockin’ niggas off gold Daytons.
6-7 lock is what I’m rollin’ when it’s sunny.
Fo’ figured, five block to keep my shit runnin’.
Gold thangs, spin in pearl pains, shinin’
And everywhere I go, niggas ask if they can buy in.
Bitches jock everywhere I go,
That’s why I roll solo at the sideshows.
Creepin’, peepin’ out these hoes,
Cuz the first one to look is the first to get chose.
So come take a ride and let me show you how it’s done,
Up in the state of Cali-funk-ia.
Nigga.

(chorus x2)
Roll, roll, roll yo’ voges up and down the street.
All the niggas drop the tops and hit the spot, if you’re ridin’ on gold
D’s.

Verse 2:
Sippin’ on some hindu, blowin’ on some indo,
Brang paint, tick tock to the Regal to the rallies, all addicted
chrome.
Strike a well, my crews is saying, you ain’t ne’er be mine,
Hungarian P.R., now I’ma let me throw back windows back and a bangin’
job.
It’s funk in the town of the fog.
Too many deaths, ain’t nobody down for the squad.
Rollin’ plushed out exact like your Cadillac,
Soldier Seargent in a car wit gat on my lap
All day. Escapin’ tracks from Vice,
Can’t wait till it get dark, might hit the club tonight.
You know them sound recycled clubs,
Where there to the bunch a big be life hype, who to da bunch a glocks
and then a bunch of unknown damn buds.
Niggas poppin’ the trunk for the funk
Benzes, Beamers, Lexus’, Caddy paint wit drops what’s out, pushin’ a
Bump.
Y’knaw’t’s how we do it in the town and I was cold,
And now to the Bay, nigga go roll yo vogues.

(chorus x2)

Verse 3:
Nut’n nice, it’s like life, I’m livin’ off in my buildin’s,
Slangin’ that ‘caine, get regular cash back, a nigga’s spillin’.
Ready and willin’ for some freaks to leap off in these streets,
So I can yap on high cap, in a nina millimeter
Then fall down, these niggas is walkin’ around with one of these ammos
under they belts.
More niggas I’m killin’ than killed, then I be up on tilt.
Right to my belly, rush is so striggity-straight as cops
And me and my ridah potnas, back to the Bay, got caps at you intrudas.
Mug, that’s when I’m slug-killed, still makin’ these drug deals
Wit a 9-double 8, tryin’ I’ll think it him and dark kill.
It was a thrill, comin’ up in these projects
All the set arsenal with them took years to duck this.
Stuck to the set, you rarely see me off the turf,
A young nigga that’s showin’ off, ready steady pushin’ that work.
Pushin’ a Caddy on Originals and Voges,
Stack wit my lap strap, with my mack Mud’fuck’s.

(chorus till fade)

[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
I drink a, a shot of pain
A glass of death
A death of glass
Back in Nazareth we
We passed the test we
We asked for less
We turn the cheek, with merit we inherit
The spirit and the free
The mirror is the miracle
The nearer we would be
If fearing the empirical’s comparable to weak
So lyrical we speak
If literal you seek, you thought you sought the wrong route
Talkin bout everything my mind ever thought about
Blocking out blacking out
Cracking down now I’m
Like lightning and thundering
Not tightening my dungarees
It’s frightening to wonder who is underneath
My writing
It’s nobody
My mind is mine
And I’m inclined to shine bright as fire I’m tryin to find my own design
So behind time I noticed I’m focused on the climb
The world is round
So up is out
I heard a sound
Love is shouting
Screamin, dreamin about a breathing demon I’m beaming light
Seeming bright need to be breathing steam if I’m redeeming my

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain’t got to listen
I know who I am
Can’t nobody tell me different
Wouldn’t change it for a mil
I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day
I’ll pro’lly grow
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day

[Bridge: Eric Sosa]
One day will it come x4

[Verse 2: Eric Sosa]
It come sooner than you think
Sooner than you blink
So pour all the rumors down the sink and
Look at yourself in the vanity
Cloaked in your sanity
Don’t let yourself melt in a pan of greed
In a pot of hate
I got a lot to say
So I approach it like it’s corporate and it’s not for play
If I ain’t focused, put a fork in it, and not the steak
See I just noticed, it’s the cautious shit I gotta take
Battle from within
Beefin from a distance
Like I have to win if I speak it into existence
Wide and fooled and avoiding whether this could sell
Tired of the bullshit with a toilet as a wishing well
So I demand that you stop killing his dreams
Standing on a rooftop of a building in Queens
Squinting while I’m cooking up the Cuban
I ain’t lookin for the man in me
I found that
I’m lookin for the human

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain’t got to listen
I know who I am
Can’t nobody tell me different
Wouldn’t change it for a mil
I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day
I’ll pro’lly grow
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
Everything I do is rock n roll
Every time I think I’ve got control
It turns out ink doesn’t got a soul
I don’t know how to go from normal all the way back to radical
Static or havoc it’s a habit
Tragic is magical
A biblical sabbatical
Seven days, seven years
OK, then will I have it?
Novocain’s saying no to pain
Plain days aggravate
Sane ways agitate
Can you imagine it?
A castaway
My stomach’s knotted
Even if I passed away I’d have to say the summit’s rotted
Cuz that is not it
I’m searching for a paragon
If I am gone & you are gone
There, that’s a pair of gones
A marathon
Let’s walk it out
Love, vibrations
That’s what I’m talking bout
Fats Waller nodding out
On the train, riding round
Sight and sound they might abound but might is trite if it’s not profound
I’m antilost
Why can’t I cross Kate Moss with weight loss?
I hate when you say pause
There’s only none
The holy sun
Amongst a clan of bullets
Standing is a lonely gun

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain’t got to listen
I know who I am
Can’t nobody tell me different
Wouldn’t change it for a mil
I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain’t givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up mind, body, soul
I ain’t givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day
I’ll pro’lly grow
I’ll be good one day
I’ll be good one day

For all the O.G.’s
And all the real G’s

(PRODEJE & LV)
Just another day in the hood with my G’s
Tryin’ to make a end, I don’t wanna slang ki’s
But how to comprimise bein’ broke to a baller
I ain’t bein’ broke when you’re short than you’re smaller
Kickin’ up dust cause I’m doin’ what I must do
(Runnin’ from the boys I even have to rush fool)
Tryin’ to play me cause I never got courted in
Bring it on then I’ma show you how it’s done friend
Mr. Prod from the West Side move to the East Side
I know a lotta real Loc G’s right
(G’s is trying to make it when it’s harder than hell)
(Everybody knows your name yo whatever you bail)
One time is on yo’ back cause they want you in the damn pen
Lil’ Locs trippin’ when you tryna regulate them
Real O.G. you got to represent your G, Loc
Make ‘em understand there’s a better way to G, Loc

(Chorus)
Just another day in the hood
G’z are on da move
You better be careful and watch your back
Cause G’z are on da move...

(? & LV)
Bein’ that, I’m a young gangsta on the move
Plus a youngsta amongst us
(G’s roll in D’s and slankin’ ki’s)
It’s so much game I soaked, I learned to slang the dope
Then clock a gangsta Loc, gang’s tellin’: dank’s to smoke
And as I peep the bustas hit me up as I pass
I ain’t even bangin’ but I be ready to blast
But that keeps the dank goin’ on and on
Down fo’ my hood and up to no good, rubbin’ my chrome
And as I think
(You pulls a threat, you’ll end up wet and then I jet with no regret)
Protecting and serving is a must
But trip just between us sometime watch make you kick off dust
(So do your blast or do your smash or put the whole situation in the past)
Maybe or maybe not is a G on the move ain’t no thang
I’m still Loc but we need to make a change

(Chorus...)

(L.V.)
Just another day in the hood with the G’s
I don’t wanna slang ki’s
All I wanna do is kick it with my homies (chillin’ in the hood)
Regulatin’ B.G.’s
Slow it down Locs or you might get smoked
And I don’t wanna have to goin’ hoo-ride
Game is deeper Loc’s
When G’s are on the move
We need to be down with the truce homie, oh yes we do
That’s the way it needs to be

(Chorus...)

[Verse One: Mike Zoot]
Some fictions advice nigga, I’m nice to the letter
For better og worse I cross the finish line
And find the purse first
Born the Kapricon, hit it and form
And show my ways of the force
Oral, grab the cource
Crosses jaws to I use it up vocabullary
It takes half reception to magnify my very
Detailed mail delivered straight from the mouth piece
Shout out to the white niggaz who don’t know about this
Super sub-urb my verbal calistetics is pathetic
MC, yo, a sinner, when I’m about to rap so ghettic
In ya head I whoop the story like the writer of a novel
Slip out the canned laugh, no time to agree the rubble
But instead I feed your head with the truth, no doubt
About low term confirm, no to make a mic burn
And since I’m Mike Zoot we get the looping dash
And with my ass and my rules, so long till last

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]
We got the runs, rhymes, beats and all things
This in it Mike Zoot the ill shit we bring
It’s like, that, this
Hit, we don’t miss
BK, to the bricks on this Tommy Tee shit

[Verse Two: El Da Sensai]
You wanna beat us, a black kid
A baby born in scorn
Here’s to all for the free
For all is joint in this sing along
To the king shit, legitimy
The harderst work in corners
I swear you want now, I don’t know ways now
Take a chance and get on
As I storm boulevards
Run up and bomb rush for once plus
My tooth sence broken, talking clothes to back of the bus
Drugs and dirt water, see realness in my aura
Is ambitious, so I slash performer
This tracks make me wanna just smoke and get loose
Tip my cup ova a fruit drink, mix it with fruit juice
Mike Zoot the new weed guy, hypnotate a big fry
Do it, wanna sell you, I know you wanna see me die
Certainify, I’m hard, not stupid
You gettin’ diplomatic, juice papers that’s no approval
On a paper, type me a favour or pay the pager
Bills are cock trees and fill the refridgerator
Till later, like when it’s done off
I wanna run off shittin’
On fake friends there are forgotten, bless the ones that didn’t
They stay fresh on my mind, like the rhyme does written
A couple of bosses dropped out, now I’m ready for the kickin’

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

El Da Sen-Sen-Sensai, oh excuse me, my name’s Mike Zoot, I’m from the 90s
El Da Sen-Sen-Sensai, my name’s Mike Zoot, I’m from the 90s

We live in a time of fear
fear of weather
fear of war fear of death
fear of deformities and fear of enslavement
and subjection by the luciferians sons of the morning
these plagues are not coming they are here

Be alarm
Ima psychological flash back from Vietnam
study everything from the Aztecs to genghis khan
to the Pyramids on mars
a lyricist evolved
on a pilgrimage from GOD serious like the Star
in the Canis Major Hiphop I am your savoir
kids singing that’s mindless behavior
it’s all love minus the haters.... Time to wake up the choosen few
those of you that will listen your time is over due
fuck are we pose to do
run rampant while they destroying the planet
visuals of satanic rituals project in our living room access granted
the mark of the beast nigga you’ve been branded
this ain’t hamlet more like Horus the children of Atlantis
snuck out of the forest and on to the Forbes list

So come and let us perform this great ceremony of the resurrection
of the dead gods for they have been dead for long enough
and their imprisonment before the blinding light of misinformation must end
you are more opt to be blinded by light then you are by darkness
the state in which GOD was he and they said let there be light

As darkness falls
watch them all
flock and fall carefully arch their skulls
to the masses to ask us if we can pass them the law
but it ain’t meat to take from the children and cast to the dogs
learned that from The Lord
Jesus Christ the key to life
is you are what you think nigga think Nigga
if you don’t like what you’ve become than think bigger
think too big and they say you need a shrink nigga
I ain’t crazy just a kid from the 80’s aunt use to push ah Mercedes
kept loot brought Sergio tacchini sweat suites for her babies
we don’t talk much but I know I owe her greatly
so don’t mistake me for a nut
unless you talking bout the nut that was buss after my father got up
which brings me to my mother cause that’s how you got fucked
they ain’t use protection and that’s how you got us..... Fear

As the clock of destiny tics on
and nature manifests her judgement out of darkness
the unseen
the unknown
the unapparent  yet ever existing
Man is light and woman is darkness
her fertilization in her ovaries
or ovum takes place in the darkness of her womb
but the sperm produced by the male must be ejaculated outward
to ejaculate is to separate the life
from the inner being and put it outside of ones self
how ever the orgasm as in the word organ
takes place inside of the woman in tripple darkness
this is the best kept secret that is best kept sacred up until now
the True God is the Mother...

Chorus: Lil’ Ya

Try to use his nine but his nine wasn’t workin’
Started bangin’ with his pump and the bitch started twerkin’
Try to use his nine but his nine wasn’t workin’
Started bangin’ with his pump and the bitch started twerkin’

{Lil’ Ya}
I put you hos on the map with my dick
Then I stuck my nine in them hos but I made ‘em sick
Now ya supposed to wonder what I’m gonna do
Well I got it on my mind let’s try the pump throw away the nine

Chorus

{Lil’ Ya}
I’m still tired of fuckin’ you bitches everyday
I try to use my nine later on the a-k
But you wasn’t satisfied it wasn’t good enough
So ya tried to test my nuts to see if I was tough
So I fucked you and fucked you and shot my hollow in you
Watched you polished the chrome while I was drinkin’ an cold brew
Freak you got life all wrong that’s why Messi your the first
Bitch in my song

Chorus

{Lil’ Ya}
Here’s another bitch named Blacke
You on the inmate pee because I fucked you with my two-twenty three
It felt good to ya you wanted to do it again we can do it again
So I tried the mack ten but the mack was to long for this ho
So I took it out had to load up the forty four
She complain’’ about the forty four sayin’ my gat to small
Stuck the sweeper in her ass started sweatin’ like a dog
HaHaHa I guess my gat was to long an Blacke you
The second bitch in my song

Chorus

{Lil’ Ya}
Lil’ Ya is the type that don’t give a shit
My three favorite words are
Doggin’ doggin’ doggin’ a bitch
Who can I talk to about Lance I’m a kick

She rode a nigga dick sucked the shells of a pump
Hit her with my glock and made the bitch jump
She came to my house sayin’ she wanted to fuck
Cheat her with my uzi she was stuck like Chuck
Ended up pregnant sayin’ the baby was mine
I fucked you with my uzi you had an baby nine
Took baby nine outside and threw ‘em in the dump
Two weeks passed I fucked that bitch with my pump
The ho face resemble queen coat matin’ so that’s
Why Takia ya the last bitch in my song

Chorus

[Chorus: Jesse West (True Love Everlasting)]
What’s your name, son? (I’m True Love Everlasting)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m God)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[True Love Everlasting]
Now the Gods walk the streets, the same as the next man
We say "Peace", and give niggas pound and spark land
We see the overall picture, and rush to make plans
While you put your life right, into the next man hand
Survival of the fittest, mad ghetto, hard hitters
New York City’s finest, greatest rhyme spitters
When it come to this game of life, they all beginning
Playing in the game of death, they all winners
Them niggas start selling they ass to eat dinners
They don’t care, they going all out, they all sinners
I guess they said ‘fuck it’, once the Devil jumped in us
We can let his ass do what he want, until he finished
The Gods give us gas to, when we have to
But we don’t put that, on every track, that we rap to
We could still build and spark L’s, when we come back, dude
But if you sling shots, we sling ‘em right back at you

[Chorus: Jesse West (RZA)]
What’s your name, son? (Eighteen, Twenty-six, One)
Are you a thug or a God? (God Cypher Divine)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[RZA]
Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah, never reneggin’
Don’t fuck with the dead pigeons or pigskin
You fuckin’ fake, 85 percent snake
Derelict ass bitch, you dead weight
Ain’t no fire escape in hell, every devil ain’t pale
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds"
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I’m hurlin’ ya’ll
Lightin’ bolts, by writin’ quotes
Strikin’ jolts that frightenin’ adults
From A to Zig-Zag, you get smacked, bitch, thrown into a shitbag
Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some fake thug
Drunk from the drink and gassed up by the drug
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis
While the Gods rebuildin’ Jerusalem, living inside golden palaces

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son? (Jess West from the beam)
Are you a thug or a God? (I’m G-O-D, son)
Peace, son (peace)
All my peeps need to eat, so (true that)
Bless the mic when you ready to speak

[Jesse West]
Now when I drop degrees, 85 percent freeze
I bomb ‘em with no problem, when they ease up
I squeeze off, I represent for O.G.’s
Who lay up in the cut, save that, roll trees
Used to flip bricks, and shit, sold d’s
Did a bid, came home, switched my whole steeze
I’m only in the game, to win more cheese
And you thugs who ain’t show me no love, can hold these
My game Trump tight like Biggie and Lil’ Cease
I reign on MC’s like Wu-Tang Killa Beez
I got peeps that hold heaters, cuz they need that
And ain’t scared to roll either, thinking something sweeter
Cats roll up, they say West, is you the hardest?
I say "Do Method Man know where the buddha spot is?"
Do 24/7 get paid regardless?
They try hard but couldn’t stop it, when we dropped this

[Chorus: Jesse West]
What’s your name, son?
Are you a thug or a God?
Peace, son
All my peeps need to eat, so
Bless the mic when you ready to speak
